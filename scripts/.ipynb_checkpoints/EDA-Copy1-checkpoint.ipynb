double toil and trouble by which many even of the weird cauldrons in which genius forms her creations are disturbed and bedimmed that power of doing everything with perfect and conscious ease which dugald stewart has ascribed to barrow and to horsley in prose distinguished dryden in poetry whether he discusses the deep questions of fate and foreknowledge in religio laici or lashes shaftesbury in the medal or pours a torrent of contempt on shadwell in macflecknoe or describes the fire of london in the annus mirabilis or soars into lyric enthusiasm in his ode on the death of mrs killigrew and

to exultation he is like the steed who glories in that tremendous gallop which affects the spectator with fear indeed we never can separate our conception of dryden s vigorous and vaulting style from the image of a noble horse devouring the dust of the field clearing obstacles at a bound taking up long leagues as a little thing and the very strength and speed of whose motion give it at a distance the appearance of smoothness pope speaks of his long resounding march and energy divine perhaps ease divine had been words more characteristic of that almost superhuman power of language by which he makes the most obstinate materials pliant melts down difficulties as if by the touch of magic and to resume the former figure comes into the goal without a hair turned on his mane or a single sweat drop confessing effort or extraordinary exertion we know no poet since homer who can be compared to dryden in this respect except scott who occasionally in marmion and the lay of the last minstrel exhibits the same impetuous ease and fiery fluent movement scott does not however in general carry the same weight as the other and the species of verse he uses in comparison to the heroic rhyme of dryden gives you often the impression of a hard trot rather than of a long resounding and magnificent gallop scott exhibits in his poetry the soul of a warrior but it is of a warrior of the border somewhat savage and coarse dryden can for the nonce at least assume the appearance and display the spirit of a knight of ancient chivalry gallant accomplished elegant and gay next to this poet s astonishing ease spirit and elastic vigour may be ranked his clear sharp intellect he may be called more a logician than a poet he reasons often and always acutely and his rhyme instead of shackling strengthens the movement of his argumentation parts of his religio laici and the hind and panther resemble portions of duns scotus or aquinas set on fire indeed keen strong intellect inflamed with passion and inspirited by that ardour and impetuosity of mind which wordsworth is compelled to allow to him rather than creative or original genius is the differentia of dryden we have compared him to a courser but he was not one of those coursers of achilles who fed on no earthly food but on the golden barley of heaven having sprung from the gods greek xanthon kai balion to ama pnoiaesi petesthaen tous eteke zephuro anemo arpua podargae dryden resembled rather the mortal steed which was yoked with these immortal twain the brood of zephyr and the harpy podarga only we can hardly say of the poet what homer says of pedasus greek os kai thnaetos eon epeth ippois athanatoisi he was not although a mortal able to keep up with the immortal coursers his path was on the plains or table lands of earth never or seldom in cloudland gorgeous land or through the aerial altitudes which stretch away and above the clouds to the gates of heaven he can hardly be said to have possessed the power of sublimity in the high sense of that term as the power of sympathising with the feeling of the infinite often he gives us the impression of the picturesque of the beautiful of the heroic of the nobly disdainful but never when writing at least entirely from his own mind of that infinite and nameless grandeur which the imaginative soul feels shed on it from the multitudinous waves of ocean from the cataract

moses of the backparts of the divine the divine itself cannot be seen has been the inspiration of all the highest poetry of the world of the paradise lost of the divina commedia of the night thoughts of wordsworth and coleridge of festus and highest far of the hebrew prophets as they cry whither can we go from thy presence whither can we flee from thy spirit such poets have resembled a blind man who feels although he cannot see that a stranger of commanding air is in the room beside him so they stand awe struck in the wind of the going of a majestic and unseen being this feeling differs from mysticism inasmuch as it is connected with a reality while the mystic dreams a vague and unsupported dream and the poetry it produces is simply the irresistible cry springing from the perception of

nation saw that the roundhead cause was lost and hastened to carry over his talents to the gaining side for this we do not blame him very severely although it certainly had been nobler if like milton he had clung to his party sir walter scott remarks that dryden never retracted the praise he gave to cromwell in absalom and achitophel he sneers at richard as ishbosheth but says nothing against the deceased giant saul it is clear too that at first his desertion of the cromwell party was a loss to the poet he lost the chance of their favour in case a reaction should come his situation as secretary and the shelter of pickering s princely mansion as might have been expected his ancient friends were indignant at the change and not less so at the alteration he thought proper at the same time to make in the spelling of his name from driden to dryden he went to reside in the obscure house of one herringman a bookseller in the new exchange and became for life a professional author his enemies afterwards reproached him bitterly for his mean circumstances at this period of his life and asserted that he was a mere drudge to herringman he at all events did little in his own proper poetic calling for two years a poem on the coronation of charles well fitted to wipe away the stain of cromwellism and to attract upon the poet the eye of that rising sun whose glory he sang with more zeal than truth a panegyric on the lord chancellor and a satire on the dutch were all and are all short and all savour of a vein somewhat hide bound he planned indeed too and partly wrote one or more plays and was considered of consequence enough to be elected a member of the royal society in previous to this he had been introduced through herringman to sir robert howard son of the first earl of berkshire and a relation of edward howard the author of british princes and the object of the witty wrath of butler sir robert too had a poetical propensity and dryden and he became and continued intimate for a number of years the poet assisting the knight in his literary compositions particularly in a play entitled the indian queen and the latter inviting the former to the family seat at charlton where dryden met in an unlucky hour his future wife lady elizabeth howard the sister of sir robert it was on the st of december in st swithin s london and with the consent of the earl who settled about a year on his daughter that this unhappy union took place the lady seems to have had absolutely none of the qualities which tend either to command a husband s respect or to conciliate his regard but is described as a woman of violent temper and weak understanding much of the bitterness of dryden s satire some of the coarse licentiousness of his plays and all the sarcasms at matrimony which he has scattered in multitudes throughout his works may be traced to his domestic unhappiness otherwise the match had some advantages it broke up for a time at least some licentious connexions he had formed particularly after a time one with mrs reeves the actress with whom having laid aside his norwich drugget he used to eat tarts at the mulberry gardens with a sword and a chadreux wig it secured to him including his own property an income of about a year a sum equal to now and which on the death of his mother three years later was increased by more or at the present value of money he was thus protected for life against the meaner and more miserable necessities of the literary man under which many of his unfortunate rivals were crushed and if he could not always command luxuries he was always sure of bread to improve his circumstances however and to enable him to keep up a style of living in unison with his lady s rank he must write and the question arose what mode of composition was likely to be the most lucrative were he to continue to indite panegyrical verses like those to clarendon he stood a chance of having a few guineas tossed to him now and

second was not content with saying witty things about his philosophers but did wise things with regard to them for he not only bestowed upon them such attention as he could spare from his poodles and his mistresses but being in his usual state of impecuniosity begged for them of the duke of ormond and that step being without effect gave them chelsea college a charter and a mace crowning his favours in the best way they could be crowned by burdening them no further with royal patronage or state interference thus it was that the half dozen young men studious of the new philosophy who met in one another s lodgings in oxford or in london in the middle of the seventeenth century grew in numerical and in real strength until in the latter part the royal society for the improvement of natural knowledge had already become famous and had acquired a claim upon the veneration of englishmen which it has ever since retained as the principal focus of scientific activity in our islands and the chief champion of the cause it was formed to support it was by the aid of the royal society that newton published his principia if all the books in the world except the philosophical transactions were destroyed it is safe to say that the foundations of physical science would remain unshaken and that the vast intellectual progress of the last two centuries would be largely though incompletely recorded nor have any signs of halting or of decrepitude manifested themselves in our own times as in dr wallis s days so in these our business is precluding theology and state affairs to discourse and consider of philosophical enquiries but our mathematick is one which newton would have to go to school to learn our staticks mechanicks magneticks chymicks and natural experiments constitute a mass of physical and chemical knowledge a glimpse at which would compensate galileo for the doings of a score of inquisitorial cardinals our physick and anatomy have embraced such infinite varieties of being have laid open such new worlds in time and space have grappled not unsuccessfully with such complex problems that the eyes of vesalius and of harvey might be dazzled by the sight of the tree that has grown out of their grain of mustard seed the fact is perhaps rather too much than too little forced upon one s notice nowadays that all this marvellous intellectual growth has a no less wonderful expression in practical life and that in this respect if in no other the movement symbolized by the progress of the royal society stands without a parallel in the history of mankind a series of volumes as bulky as the transactions of the royal society might possibly be filled with the subtle speculations of the schoolmen not improbably the obtaining a mastery over the products of mediaeval thought might necessitate an even greater expenditure of time and of energy than the acquirement of the new philosophy but though such work engrossed the best intellects of europe for a longer time than has elapsed since the great fire its effects were writ in water so far as our social state is concerned on the other hand if the noble first president of the royal society could revisit the upper air and once more gladden his eyes with a sight of the familiar mace he would find himself in the midst of a material civilization more different from that of his day than that of the seventeenth was from that of the first century and if lord brouncker s native sagacity had not deserted his ghost he would need no long reflection to discover that all these great ships these railways these telegraphs these factories these printing presses without which the whole fabric of modern english society would collapse into a mass of stagnant and starving pauperism that all these pillars of our state are but the ripples and the bubbles upon the surface of that great spiritual stream the springs of which only he and his fellows were privileged to see and seeing to recognise as that which it behoved them above all things to keep pure and undefiled it may not be too great a flight of imagination to conceive our noble revenant not forgetful of the great troubles of his own day and anxious to know how often london had been burned down since his time and how often the plague had carried off its thousands he would have to learn that although london contains tenfold the inflammable matter that it did in though not content with filling our rooms with woodwork and light draperies we must needs lead inflammable and explosive gases into every corner of our streets and houses we never allow even a street to burn down and if he asked how this had come about we should have to explain that the improvement of natural knowledge has furnished us with dozens of machines for throwing water upon fires any one of which would have furnished the ingenious mr hooke the first curator and experimenter of the royal society with ample materials for discourse before half a dozen meetings of that body and that to say truth except for the progress of natural knowledge we should not have been able to make even the tools by which these machines are constructed and further it would be necessary to add that although severe fires sometimes occur and inflict great damage the loss is very generally compensated by societies the operations of which have been rendered possible only by the progress of natural knowledge in the direction of mathematics and the accumulation of wealth in virtue of other natural knowledge but the plague my lord brouncker s observation would not i

leaving a memorial pointing out that he had also been a painter and there was no lack of other celebrated painters belonging to other illustrious families in fact from painting which is in itself a most worthy and noble art many useful skills can be derived and not least for military purposes thus a knowledge of the art gives one the facility to sketch towns rivers bridges citadels fortresses

as men are always eager for any thing new it seemed likely that someone might try to have it printed alarmed at this peril then i resolved to revise the book at once so far as i had time with intent

as the nature of the thing will allow and especially since the advantages and good consequences of the thing itself are so many and so easy to be seen as his friends allege why should not the good people of britain be made easy and their fears be turned into peaceable satisfaction by seeing that this devil may not be so black as he is painted and that the noise made of the pretender and the frightful things said of his coming and of his being received here may not be made greater scarecrows to us than they really are and after all that has been said if it should appear that the advantages of the pretender s succession are really greater to us and the dangers less to us than those of the succession of hanover then much of their difficulties would be over who standing neuter as to persons appear against the pretender only because they are made to believe strange and terrible things of what shall befall the nation in case of his coming in such as popery slavery french

not be called pretenders then there will remain nothing more to be said on that score but the debate must be of the reasonableness and justice on either side for their admittance and there we question not but the side we are really pleading for will have the advantage to begin then with that most popular and affrighting argument now made use of as the bugbear of the people against several other things besides jacobitism we mean french greatness it is most evident that the fear of this must by the nature of the thing be effectually removed upon our receiving the pretender the grounds and reasons why french greatness is rendered formidable to us and so much weight supposed to be in it that like the name of scanderberg we fright our very children with it lie only in this that we suggest the king of france being a professed enemy to the peace and the liberty of great britain will most certainly as soon as he can a little recover himself exercise all that formidable power to put the pretender upon us and not only to place him upon the throne of great britain but to maintain and hold him up in it against all the opposition either of the people of britain or the confederate princes leagued with the elector of hanover who are in the interest of his claim or of his party now it is evident that upon a peaceable admitting this person whom they call the pretender to receive and enjoy the crown here all that formidable power becomes your friend and the being so must necessarily take off from it everything that is called terrible forasmuch as the greater terror and amusement the power we apprehend really carries with it the greater is the tranquillity and satisfaction which accrues to us when we have the friendship of that power which was so formidable to us before the power of france is represented at this time very terrible and the writers who speak of it apply it warm to our imaginations as that from whence we ought justly to apprehend the impossibility of keeping out the pretender and this notwithstanding they allow themselves at the same time to suppose all the confederate powers of europe to be engaged as well by their own interest as by the new treaties of barrier and guarantee to support and to assist the claim of the elector of hanover and his party now if this power be so great and so formidable as they allege will it not on the other side add a proportion of increase to our satisfaction that this power will be wholly in friendship and league with us and engaged to concern itself for the quieting our fears of other foreign invaders forasmuch as having once concerned itself to set the person of the pretender upon the throne it cannot be supposed but it shall be equally concerned to support and maintain him in that possession as what will mightily conduce to the carrying on the other projects of his greatness and glory with the rest of europe in which it will be very much his interest to secure himself from any opposition he might meet with from this nation or from such as might be rendered powerful by our assistance an eminent instance we have of this in the mighty efforts the french nation have made for planting and preserving when planted a grandson of france upon the throne of spain and how eminent are the advantages to france from the success of that undertaking of what less consequence then would it be to the august monarchy of france to secure and engage to himself the constant friendship and assistance of the power of great britain which he would necessarily do by the placing this person upon the throne who would thereby in gratitude be engaged to contribute his utmost in return to the king of france for the carrying on his glorious designs in the rest of europe while then we become thus necessary to the king of france reason dictates that he would be our fast friend our constant confederate our ally firmly engaged to secure our sovereign and protect our people from the insults and attempts of all the

out with a lamentable cry saying what shall i do bedford jail in which bunyan was twelve years a prisoner in this plight therefore he went home and restrained himself as long as he could that his wife

he spent it in sighs and tears so when the morning was come they would know how he did he told them worse and worse he also set to talking to them again but they began to be hardened they also thought to drive away his madness by harsh and surly treatment of him sometimes they would ridicule sometimes they would chide and sometimes they would quite neglect him wherefore he began to retire himself to his chamber to pray for and pity them and also to sorrow over his own misery he would also walk solitary in the fields sometimes reading and sometimes praying and thus for some days he spent his

way to go i looked then and saw a man named evangelist coming to him who asked wherefore dost thou cry illustration evangelist points to wicket gate page he answered sir i read in the book in my hand that i am condemned to die and after that to come to judgment and i find that i am not willing to do the first nor able to do the second then said evangelist why not willing to die since this life is troubled with so many evils the man answered because i fear that this burden that is upon my back will sink me lower than the grave and i shall fall into tophet and sir if i be not fit to go to prison i am not fit to go to judgment and from thence to death and the thoughts of these things make me cry tophet here means hell then said evangelist if this be thy condition why standest thou still he answered because i know not whither to go then he gave him a parchment roll and there was written within flee from the wrath to come the man therefore read it and looking upon evangelist very carefully said whither must i fly then said evangelist pointing with his finger over a very wide field do you see yonder wicket gate the man said no then said the other do you see yonder shining light

veal my dear friend i am come to renew our old friendship again and beg your pardon for my breach of it and if you can forgive me you are the best of women o says mrs bargrave do not mention such a thing i have not had an uneasy thought about it i can easily forgive it what did you think of me said mrs veal says mrs bargrave i thought you were like the rest of the world and that prosperity had made you forget yourself and me then mrs veal reminded mrs bargrave of the many friendly offices she did her in former days and much of the conversation they had with each other in the times of their adversity what books they read and what comfort in particular they received from drelincourt s book of death which was the best she said on that subject ever written she also mentioned dr sherlock the two dutch books which were translated written upon death and several others but drelincourt she said had the clearest notions of death and of the future state of any who had handled that subject then she asked mrs bargrave whether she had drelincourt she said yes says mrs veal fetch it and so mrs bargrave goes up stairs and brings it down says mrs veal dear mrs bargrave if the eyes of our faith were as open as the eyes of our body we should see numbers of angels about us for our guard the notions we have of heaven now are nothing like what it is as drelincourt says therefore be comforted under your afflictions and believe that the almighty has a particular regard to you and that your afflictions are marks of god s favour and when they have done the business they are sent for they shall be removed from you and believe me my dear friend believe what i say to you one minute of future happiness will infinitely reward you for all your sufferings for i can never believe and claps her hand upon her knee with great earnestness which indeed ran through most of her discourse that ever god will suffer you to spend all your days in this afflicted state but be assured that your afflictions shall leave you or you them in a short time she spake in that pathetical and heavenly manner that mrs bargrave wept several times she was so deeply affected with it then mrs veal mentioned dr kenrick s ascetick at the end of which he gives an account of the lives of the primitive christians their pattern she recommended to our imitation and said their conversation was not like this of our age for now says she there is nothing but frothy vain discourse which is far different from theirs theirs was to edification and to build one another up in faith so that they were not as we are nor are we as they were but says she we ought to do as they did there was an hearty friendship among them but where is it now to be found says mrs bargrave it is hard indeed to find a true friend in these days says mrs veal mr norris has a fine copy of verses called friendship in perfection which i wonderfully admire have you seen the book says mrs veal no says mrs bargrave but i have the verses of my own writing out have you says mrs veal then fetch them which she did from above stairs and offered them to mrs veal to read who refused and waived the thing saying holding down her head would make it ache and then desired mrs bargrave to read them to her which she did as they were admiring friendship mrs veal said dear mrs bargrave i shall love you for ever in these verses there is twice used the word elysian ah says mrs veal these poets have such names for heaven she would often draw her hand across her own eyes and say mrs bargrave do not you think i am mightily impaired by my fits no says mrs bargrave i think you look as well as ever i knew you after all this discourse which the apparition put in much finer words than mrs bargrave said she could pretend to and as much more than she can remember for it cannot be thought that an hour and three quarters conversation could all be retained though the main of it she thinks she does she said to mrs bargrave she would have her write a letter to her brother and tell him she would have him give rings to such and such and that there was a purse of gold in her cabinet and that she would have two broad pieces given to her cousin watson talking at this rate mrs bargrave thought that a fit was coming upon her and so placed herself in a chair just before her knees to keep her from falling to the ground if her fits should occasion it for the elbow chair she thought would keep her from falling on either side and to divert mrs veal as she thought took hold of her gown sleeve several times and commended it mrs veal told her it was a scowered silk and newly made up but for all this mrs veal persisted in her request and told mrs bargrave she must not deny her and she would have her tell her brother all their conversation when she had opportunity dear mrs veal says mrs bargrave this seems so impertinent that i cannot tell how to comply with it and what a mortifying story will our conversation be to a young gentleman why says mrs bargrave it is much better methinks to do it yourself no says mrs veal though it seems impertinent to you now you will see more reason for it hereafter mrs bargrave then to

with the greatest sincerity that we do not believe the ministry are in any kind or with any prospect near or remote acting for or with a design or view to bring in the pretender having granted this we must however to prevent any breaking in by way of cavil on one hand or triumph on the other subjoin immediately that we do not in the least grant by this that the protestant succession is in no danger even from several of the measures now taken in the world it is far from any reflection upon the ministry to say that however they may act upon a right sincere principle for the protestant succession in all they do which as above we profess to believe yet that many of the tools they make use of are of another make and have no edge to cut any other way no thoughts to move them towards any other end no other centre which they can have any tendency to that the pretender s interest is the magnet which draws them by its secret influence to point to him as their pole that they have their aim at his establishment here and own it to be their aim and as they are not shy to profess it among themselves so their conduct in many things makes it sufficiently public this is not meant as any reflection upon the ministry for making use of such men the late ministry did the same and every ministry will and must employ men sometimes not as they always join with them in their politic principles but as either the men are found useful in their several employments or as the ministry may be under other circumstances which makes it necessary to them to employ them nor as the review well enough observed does it follow that because the ministry have employed or joined with jacobites in the public affairs that therefore they must have done it with a jacobite principle but let the ministry employ these men by what necessity or upon what occasion they will though it may not follow that the ministry are therefore for the pretender yet it does not also follow that there is no danger of the protestant succession from the employing those sort of people for what if the queen should die the ministry it is hoped are established in the interest of their queen and country and therefore it has been argued that supposing the ministry had the pretender in their eye yet that it is irrational to suggest that they can have any such view during the life of her present majesty nay even those professed jacobites who we spoke of just now cannot be so ungrateful to think of deposing the queen who has been so bountiful so kind so exceeding good to them as in several cases to suffer them to be brought into the management of her own affairs when by their character they might have been thought dangerous even to her person thus winning and engaging them by her bounty and the confidence that has been placed in them not to attempt anything to her prejudice without the most monstrous ingratitude without flying in the face of all that sense of honour and obligation which it is possible for men of common sense to entertain and it can hardly be thought that even papists themselves under the highest possessions of their religious zeal can conquer the native aversions they must have to such abominable ingratitude or to think of bringing in the pretender upon this protestant nation even while the queen shall be on the throne but though this may and some doubt that also tie up their hands during the queen s life yet they themselves give us but small reason to expect anything from them afterward and it will be hard to find anybody to vouch for them then these very jacobites papists and professed enemies to the revolution may be supposed upon these pretensions to be quiet and offer no violence to the present establishment while her majesty has the possession and while that life lasts to which they are so much indebted for her royal goodness and clemency but what would they do if the queen should die come we next to the french king we are told that not the french king only but even the whole french nation are wonderfully forward to acknowledge the obligation they are under to the justice and favour which they have received from her majesty in the putting an end to the war a war which lay heavy upon them and threatened the very name of the french nation with ruin and much more threatened the glory of the french court and of their great monarch with an entire overthrow a total

bloodshed that the incidents we shall attempt to relate occurred during the third year of the war which england and france last waged for the possession of a country that neither was destined to retain the imbecility of her military leaders abroad and the fatal want of energy in her councils at home had lowered the character of great britain from the proud elevation on which it had been placed by the talents and enterprise of her former warriors and statesmen no longer dreaded by her enemies her servants were fast losing the confidence of self respect in this mortifying abasement the colonists though innocent of her imbecility and too humble to be the agents of her blunders were but the natural participators they had recently seen a chosen army from that country which reverencing as a mother they had blindly believed invincible an army led by a chief who had been selected from a crowd of trained warriors for his rare military endowments disgracefully routed by a handful of french and indians and only saved from annihilation by the coolness and spirit of a virginian boy whose riper fame has since diffused itself with the steady influence of moral truth to the uttermost confines of christendom a wide frontier had been laid naked by this unexpected disaster and more substantial evils were preceded by a thousand fanciful and imaginary dangers the alarmed colonists believed that the yells of the savages mingled with every fitful gust of wind that issued from the interminable forests of the west the terrific character of their merciless enemies increased immeasurably the natural horrors of warfare numberless recent massacres were still vivid in their recollections nor was there any ear in the provinces so deaf as not to have drunk in with avidity the narrative of some fearful tale of midnight murder in which the natives of the forests were the principal and barbarous actors as the credulous and excited traveller related the hazardous chances of the wilderness the blood of the timid curdled with terror and mothers cast anxious glances even at those children which slumbered within the security of the largest towns in short the magnifying influence of fear began to set at naught the calculations of reason and to render those who should have remembered their manhood the slaves of the basest of passions even the most confident and the stoutest hearts began to think the issue of the contest was becoming doubtful and that abject class was hourly increasing in numbers who thought they foresaw all the possessions of the english crown in america subdued by their christian foes or laid waste by the inroads of their relentless allies when therefore intelligence was received at the fort which covered the southern termination of the portage between the hudson and the lakes that montcalm had been seen moving up the champlain with an army numerous as the leaves on the trees its truth was admitted with more of the craven reluctance of fear than with the stern joy that a warrior should feel in finding an enemy within reach of his blow the news had been brought towards the decline of a day in midsummer by an indian runner who also bore an urgent request from munro the commander of a work on the shore of the holy lake for a speedy and powerful reinforcement it has already been mentioned that the distance between these two posts was less than five leagues the rude path which originally formed their line of communication had been widened for the passage of wagons so that the distance which had been travelled by the son of the forest in two hours might easily be effected by a detachment of troops with their necessary baggage between the rising and setting of a summer sun the loyal servants of the british crown had given to one of these forest fastnesses the name of william henry and to the other that of fort edward calling each after a favorite prince of the reigning family the veteran scotchman just named held the first with a regiment of regulars and a few provincials a force really by far too small to make head against the formidable power that montcalm was leading to the foot of his earthen mounds at the latter however lay general webb who commanded the armies of the king in the northern provinces with a body of more than five thousand men by uniting the several detachments of his command this officer might have arrayed nearly double that number of combatants against the enterprising frenchman who had ventured so far from his reinforcements with an army but little superior in numbers but under the influence of their degraded fortunes both officers and men appeared better disposed to await the approach of their formidable antagonists within their works than to resist the progress of their march by emulating the successful example of the french at fort du quesne and striking a blow on their advance after the first surprise of the intelligence had a little abated a rumor was spread through the entrenched camp which stretched along the margin of the hudson forming a chain of outworks to the body of the fort itself that a chosen detachment of fifteen hundred men was to depart with the dawn for william henry the post at the northern extremity of the portage that which at first was only rumor soon became certainty as orders passed from the quarters of the commander in chief to the several

been capable of the least disposition to virtue or wisdom yet so far have you been from answering my expectation in any of your letters that on the contrary you are loading our carrier every week with

remember upon each return to my own country their old dialect was so altered that i could hardly understand the new and i observe when any yahoo comes from london out of curiosity to visit me at my house we neither of us are able to deliver our conceptions in a manner intelligible to the other if the censure of the yahoos could any way affect me i should have great reason to complain that some

by their own confession it was impossible for them long to have supported the expenses of and which by the great superiority of the allies became dreadful to them and that every campaign more than the

vain and a war which if her majesty had not inclined to put an end to must have ended perhaps to the disadvantage and confusion of both france and spain if not of all christendom the obligations the french are under for the bringing this war to so just and honourable a conclusion are not at all concealed nay the french themselves have not been backward to make them public the declarations made by the french king of his sincerity in the overtures made for a general peace the protestations of his being resolved to enter into an entire confidence and a league offensive and defensive with the queens majesty for the preservation of the peace of christendom his recognition of her majestys just right to the crown his entering into articles to preserve the union acknowledging the ninth electorate in favour of the house of hanover and joining in the great affair of the protestant succession as these all convince the world of the necessity his affairs were reduced to and the great

possession of the queen during her life not that the honour and sincerity of the king of france is a foundation fit for her majesty or her people to have any dependence upon and the fraction of former treaties by that court when the glory of that monarch or his particular views of things has dictated such opportunity to him as he thought fit to close with are due cautions to us all not to have any

his enemies in making peace with her majesty he knows very well with what loss he sits down how his affairs are weakened and what need he has to take breath after so terrible a war besides the flame

and spain on the other we all know the french had a free trade into the south seas a trade carried on with the greatest advantage and to the greatest degree that any particular commerce has been carried on in the world for many ages past insomuch that we found the return of silver that came back to france by those ships was not only the enriching of the merchants of st malo rochelle and other ports in france some of whom we saw get immense estates in a few years even to a million sterling a man but it was evident the king of france himself was enabled by the circulation of so much bullion through his mints to carry on that war with very great advantage it was just at the close of this war when some merchants of london looking with envy on the success of that trade and how the french notwithstanding the peace would apparently carry it on for some years at least to infinite advantage began to consider whether it might not be possible to come in for a portion of it with france as they were allied to spain and yet go abroad in the nature of a private cruiser to bring this to pass it was thought proper in the first place to get a share if possible in a new design of an east india trade in flanders just then intended to be set up by some british merchants by the assistance of an imperial charter or at least under colour of it and so we might go to sea in a threefold capacity to be made use of as occasion might present viz when on the coast of new spain we sought to trade we were frenchmen had a french captain and a sufficient number of french seamen and flemish or walloon seamen who spoke french so to appear on all proper occasions when at sea we met with any spanish ship worth our while we were english cruisers had letters of mart from england had no account of the peace and were fitted for the attack and when in the east indies we had occasion to trade either at the english or dutch settlements we should have imperial colours and two flemish merchants at least in appearance to transact everything as we found occasion however this last part of our project failed us that affair not being fully ripe as this mysterious equipment may be liable to some exceptions and perhaps to some inquiries i shall for the present conceal my name and that of the ship also by inquiries i mean inquiries of private persons concerned for as to public inquiries we have no uneasiness having acted nothing in contradiction to the rules and laws of our country but i say as to private persons it is thought fit to prevent their inquiries to which end the captain in whose name i write this gives me leave to make use of his name and conceal my own the ship sailed from the river the th of december and went directly over to the coast of flanders lying at an anchor in newport pitts as they are called where we took in our french captain jean michael merlotte who with thirty two french seamen came on board us in a large snow from dunkirk bringing with them one hundred and twenty two small ankers or rundlets of brandy and some hampers and casks of french wine in wickered bottles while we were here we lay under english colours with pendants flying our ship being upwards of five hundred ton and had forty six guns mounted manned with three hundred and fifty six men we took the more men on board because we resolved as occasion should present to fit ourselves with another ship which we did not question we should meet with in the south seas we had also a third design in our voyage though it may be esteemed an accident to the rest viz we were resolved to make some attempts for new discoveries as opportunity offered and we had two persons on board who were exceeding well qualified for our direction in this part all which was derived from the following occasion the person who was principally concerned in the adventure was a man not only of great wealth but of great importance he was particularly addicted to what we call new discoveries and it was indeed upon his genius to such things that the first thought of the voyage was founded this gentleman told me that he had already sent one ship fully equipped and furnished for a new attempt upon the north west or north east passages which had been so often in vain tried by former navigators and that he did not question the success because he had directed them by new measures and to steer a course that was never attempted yet and his design in our voyage was to make like discoveries towards the south pole where as he said and gave us very good reasons for it he did not doubt but we might discover even to the pole itself and find out new worlds and new seas which had never been heard of before with these designs this gentleman came into the other part of our project and contributed the more largely and with the more freedom to the whole upon that account in particular all the needful preparations for such discoveries were made wholly at his expense which i take notice of here as being most proper in the beginning of our story and that the reader may the less wonder at the particular way we took to perform a voyage which might with much more ease have been done by the usual and ordinary way we sailed from the coast of flanders the nd of january and without any extraordinary incident made the coast of galway in ireland the th where we stayed and took in a very extraordinary store of provisions three times as much as usual the beef being also well pickled or double packed that we might have a sufficient reserve for the length of our voyage resolving also to spare it as much as possible we had a very rich cargo on board consisting of all sorts of british manufactures suitable for the spanish trade in their west indies and as we aimed at nothing of

precious possession of every individual and as long as opinion the great support of the state depend entirely upon that voice it can never be considered as a thing of little consequence either to individuals or to government nations are not primarily ruled by laws less by violence whatever original energy may be supposed either in force or regulation the operation of both is in truth merely instrumental nations are governed by the same methods and on the same principles by which an individual without authority is often able to govern those who are his equals or his superiors by a knowledge of their temper and by a judicious management of it i mean when public affairs are steadily and quietly conducted not when government is nothing but a continued scuffle between the magistrate and the multitude in which sometimes the one and sometimes the other is uppermost in which they alternately yield and prevail in a series of contemptible victories and scandalous

of the particular distemperature of our own air and season nobody i believe will consider it merely as the language of spleen or disappointment if i say that there is something particularly alarming in the present conjuncture there is hardly a man in or out of power who holds any other language that government is at once dreaded and contemned that the laws are despoiled of all their respected and salutary terrors that their inaction is a subject of ridicule and their exertion of abhorrence that rank and office and title and all the solemn plausibilities of the world have lost their reverence and effect that our foreign politics are as much deranged as our domestic economy that our dependencies are slackened in their affection and loosened from their obedience that we know neither how to yield nor how to enforce that hardly anything above or below abroad or at home is sound and entire but that disconnection and confusion in offices in parties in families in parliament in the nation prevail beyond the disorders of any former time these are facts universally admitted and lamented this state of things is the more extraordinary because the great parties which formerly divided and agitated the kingdom are known to be in a manner entirely dissolved no great external calamity has visited the nation no pestilence or famine we do not labour at present under any scheme of taxation

the talents and perseverance of de foe began now to be properly estimated and as a firm supporter of the administration he was sent by lord godolphin to scotland on an errand which as he says was far from being unfit for a sovereign to direct or an honest man to perform his knowledge of commerce and revenue his powers of insinuation and above all his readiness of pen were deemed of no small

was ordained and obtained the prebend of kilroot near belfast where he carried on a flirtation with a miss waring whom he called varina but in may temple made proposals which induced swift to return to moor park where he was employed in preparing temple s memoirs and correspondence for publication and in supporting the side taken by temple in the letters of phalaris controversy by writing the battle of the books which was however not published until on his return to temple s house swift found his old playmate grown from a sickly child into a girl of fifteen in perfect health she came he

opportunity of pursuing his studies at temple s death he was as far to seek as ever in the summer of however he was offered and accepted the post of secretary and chaplain to the earl of berkeley one of the lords justices but when he reached ireland he found that the secretaryship had been given to another he soon however obtained the living of laracor agher and rathbeggan and the prebend of dunlavin in st patrick s cathedral dublin the total value of these preferments was about pounds a year an income which miss waring seems to have thought enough to justify him in marrying swift s reply

who was generally in charge of the playground who had learned by long experience that whenever bob repton was quiet he was certain to be planning some special piece of mischief the usher was sitting now on a bench with a book in his hand but his attention was at present directed to a group of four boys who had drawn together in a corner of the playground there is repton again he said to himself i wonder what he is plotting now that boy will be the death of me i am quite sure it was he who put that eel in my bed last week though of course i could not prove it mr purfleet prided himself on his nerve he had been telling the boys some stories he had read of snakes in india among them one of an officer who when seated at table had felt a snake winding itself round his leg and who sat for several minutes without moving until some friends brought a saucer of milk and placed it near when the snake uncurled itself and went to drink it must have required a lot of nerve mr purfleet bob repton had said to sit as quiet as that not at all not at all the usher replied confidently it was the natural thing to do a man should always be calm in case of sudden danger bob the first thought in his mind should be what is this the second what had best be done under the circumstances and these two things being decided a man of courage will deal coolly with the danger i should despise myself if i were to act otherwise it was two nights later that the usher having walked down between the two rows of beds in the dormitory and seeing that all the boys were quiet and apparently asleep proceeded to his own bed which was at the end of the room and partly screened off from the rest by a curtain no sooner did he disappear behind this than half a dozen heads were raised an oil lamp burned at the end of the room affording light for the usher to undress and enabling him as he lay in bed to command a general if somewhat faint view of the dormitory five minutes after mr purfleet had disappeared behind the curtain the watching eyes saw the clothes at the end of the bed pulled down and caught a partial view of mr purfleet as he climbed in a second later there was a yell of terror and the usher leapt from the bed instantly the dormitory was in an uproar what is it mr purfleet what is the matter sir and several of the boys sprang from their beds and ran towards him the only exceptions to the general excitement being the four or five who were in the secret these lay shaking with suppressed laughter with the bedclothes or the corner of a pillow thrust into their mouths to prevent them from breaking out into screams of delight what is it sir it was some time before the usher could recover himself sufficiently to explain there is a snake in my bed he said a snake the boys repeated in astonishment several of the more timid at once making off to their beds certainly a snake mr purfleet panted i put my legs down and they came against something cold and it began to twist about in a moment if i had not leapt out i should no doubt have received a fatal wound where did it come from what is to be done and a variety of other questions burst from the boys i will run down and get three or four hockey sticks mr purfleet one of the elder boys said that will be the best plan mason quick quick there do you see it moving under the clothes there was certainly something wriggling so there was a general movement back from the bed we had better hold the clothes down mr purfleet bob repton said pushing himself forward if it were to crawl out at the top and get on to the floor it might bite a dozen of us i will hold the clothes down tight on one side if someone will hold them on the other one of the other boys came forward and the clothes were stretched tightly across the bed by the pillow in a minute or two mason ran up with four hockey sticks now you must be careful mr purfleet said because if it should get out the consequences might be terrible now then four of you take the sticks and all hit together as hard as you can now the sticks descended together there was a violent writhing and contortion beneath the clothes but the blows rained down fast and in a very short time all movement ceased it must be dead now bob repton said i think we can look at it now sir well draw the clothes down very gently boys and be ready to strike again if you see the least movement the clothes were drawn down till the creature was visible it must be a cobra the usher said looking at it from a distance it is thick and short it must have escaped from somewhere be very careful all of you mason approached cautiously to get a nearer view and then exclaimed why sir it is an eel there was a moment s silence and then a perfect yell of laughter from the boys for a moment the usher was dumbfounded then he rallied you will all go to your beds at once he said i shall report the matter to mr tulloch in the morning the boys retired laughing to their beds but above the din the usher heard the words in a muffled voice a man should always be calm in sudden danger another voice equally disguised said yes he should first ask himself what is this then what had best be done under the circumstances a third voice then took it up it follows that a man of courage will deal coolly with the danger then there was a chorus of half a dozen voices i should despise myself if i were to act

the people especially the weather being now changed and growing warm and the summer being at hand however the next week there seemed to be some hopes again the bills were low the number of the dead in all was but there was none of the plague and but four of the spotted fever but the following week it returned again and the distemper was spread into two or three other parishes viz st andrew s holborn st clement danes and to the great affliction of the city one died within the walls in the parish of st mary woolchurch that is to say in bearbinder lane near stocks market in all there were nine of the plague and six of the spotted fever it was however upon inquiry found that this frenchman who died in bearbinder lane was one who having lived in long acre near the infected houses had removed for fear of the distemper not knowing that he was already infected this was the beginning of may yet the weather was temperate variable and cool enough and people had still some hopes that which encouraged them was that the city was healthy the whole ninety seven parishes buried but fifty four and we began to hope that as it was chiefly among the people at that end of the town it might go no farther and the rather because the next week which was from the th of may to the th there died but three of which not one within the whole city or liberties and st andrew s buried but fifteen which was very low tis true st giles s buried two and thirty but still as there was but one of the plague people began to be easy the whole bill also was very low for the week before the bill was but and the week above mentioned but we continued in these hopes for a few days but it was but for a few for the people were no more to be deceived thus they searched the houses and found that the plague was really spread every way and that many died of it every day so that now all our extenuations abated and it was no more to be concealed nay it quickly appeared that the infection had spread itself beyond all hopes of abatement that in the parish of st giles it was gotten into several streets and several families lay all sick together and accordingly in the weekly bill for the next week the thing began to show itself there was indeed but fourteen set down of the plague but this was all knavery and collusion for in st giles s parish they buried forty in all whereof it was certain most of them died of the plague though they were set down of other distempers and though the number of all the burials were not increased above thirty two and the whole bill being but yet there was fourteen of the spotted fever as well as fourteen of the plague and we took it for granted upon the whole that there were fifty died that week of the plague the next bill was from the rd of may to the th when the number of the plague was seventeen but the burials in st giles s were fifty three a frightful number of whom they set down but nine of the plague but on an examination more strictly by the justices of peace and at the lord mayor s request it was found there were twenty more who were really dead of the plague in that parish but had been set down of the spotted fever or other distempers besides others concealed but those were trifling things to what followed immediately after for now the weather set in hot and from the first week in june the infection spread in a dreadful manner and the bills rose high the articles of the fever spotted fever and teeth began to swell for all that could conceal their distempers did it to prevent their neighbours shunning and refusing to converse with them and also to prevent authority shutting up their houses which though it was not yet practised yet was threatened and people were extremely terrified at the thoughts of it the second week in

we do not conceive this to be true but admitting it to be so it would only prove that feudality to this extent is a part of the institutions of the state what is more it would become a part over which the state itself has conceded all power of control beyond that which it may remotely possess as one out of twenty eight communities as respects this feudal feature it is not easy to say where it must be looked for it is not to be found in the simple fact of paying rent for that is so general as to render the whole country feudal could it be true it cannot be in the circumstance that the rent is to be paid in kind as it is called and in labour for that is an advantage to the tenant by affording him the option since the penalty of a failure leaves the alternative of paying in money it must be therefore that these leases are feudal because they run for ever now the length of the lease is clearly a concession to the tenant and was so regarded when received and there is not probably a single tenant under lives who would not gladly exchange his term of possession for that of one of these detestable durable leases among the absurdities that have been circulated on this subject of feudality it has been pretended that the well known english statute of quia emptores has prohibited fines for alienation or that the quarter sales fifth sales sixth sales c of our own leases were contrary to the law of the realm when made under the common law in certain cases of feudal tenures the fines for alienation were an incident of the tenure the statute of quia emptores abolished that general principle but it in no manner forbade parties to enter into covenants of the nature of quarter sales did they see fit the common law gives all the real estate to the eldest son our statute divides the real estate among the nearest of kin without regard even to sex it might just as well be pretended that the father cannot devise all his lands to his eldest son under our statute as to say that the law of edward i prevents parties from bargaining for quarter sales altering a provision of the common law does not preclude parties from making covenants similar to its ancient provisions feudal tenures were originally divided into two great classes those which were called the military tenures or knight s service and soccage the first tenure was that which became oppressive in the progress of society soccage was of two kinds free and villian the first has an affinity to our own system as connected with these leases the last never existed among us at all when the knight s service or military tenures of england were converted into free soccage in the reign of charles ii the concession was considered of a character so favourable to liberty as to be classed among the great measures of the time one of which was the habeas corpus act the only feature of our own leases in the least approaching villian soccage is that of the day s works but every one acquainted with the habits of american life will understand that husbandmen in general throughout the northern states would regard it as an advantage to be able to pay their debts in this way and the law gives them an option since a failure to pay in kind or in work merely incurs the forfeiture of paying what the particular thing is worth in money in point of fact money has always been received for these day s works and at a stipulated price but it is pretended whatever may be the equity of these leasehold contracts they are offensive to the tenants and ought to be abrogated for the peace of the state the state is bound

confessed that no man hitherto has reached or so much as approached to the excellences of homer or of virgil i must farther add that statius the best versificator next to virgil knew not how to design after him though he had the model in his eye that lucan is wanting both in design and subject and is besides too full of heat and affectation that amongst the moderns ariosto neither designed justly nor observed any unity of action or compass of time or moderation in the vastness of his draught his style is luxurious without majesty or decency and his adventures without the compass of nature and possibility tasso whose design was regular and who observed the roles of unity in time and place more closely than virgil yet was not so happy in his action he confesses himself to have been too lyrical that is to have written beneath the dignity of heroic verse in his episodes of sophronia erminia and armida his story is not so pleasing as ariosto s he is too flatulent sometimes and sometimes too dry many times unequal and almost always forced and besides is full of conceits points of epigram and witticisms all which are not only below the dignity of heroic verse but contrary to its nature virgil and homer have not one of them and those who are guilty of so boyish an ambition in so grave a subject are so far from being considered as heroic poets that they ought to be turned down from homer to the anthologia from virgil to martial and owen s epigrams and from spenser to flecknoe that is from the top to the bottom of all poetry but to return to tasso he borrows from the invention of boiardo and in his alteration of his poem which is infinitely for the worse imitates homer so very servilely that for example he gives the king of jerusalem fifty sons only because homer had bestowed the like number on king priam he kills the youngest in the same manner and has provided his hero with a patroclus under another name only to bring him back to the wars when his friend was killed the french have performed nothing in this kind which is not far below those two italians and subject to a thousand more reflections without examining their st louis their pucelle or their alaric the english have only to boast of spenser and milton who neither of them wanted either genius or learning to have been perfect poets and yet both of them are liable to many censures for there is no uniformity in the design of spenser he aims at the accomplishment of no one action he raises up a hero for every one of his adventures and endows each of them with some particular moral virtue

prince arthur shines throughout the whole poem and succours the rest when they are in distress the original of every knight was then living in the court of queen elizabeth and he attributed to each of them that virtue which he thought was most conspicuous in them an ingenious piece of flattery though it turned not much to his account had he lived to finish his poem in the six remaining legends it had certainly been more of a piece but could not have been perfect because the model was not true but prince arthur or his chief patron sir philip sidney whom he intended to make happy by the marriage of his gloriana dying before him deprived the poet both of means and spirit to accomplish his design for the rest his obsolete language and the ill choice of his stanza are faults but of the second magnitude for notwithstanding the first he is still intelligible at least after a little practice and for the last he is the more to be admired that labouring under such a difficulty his verses are so

man who reads this paper will look upon me to be at least a person of as much honesty and understanding as a common maker of almanacks i do not lurk in the dark i am not wholly unknown in the world i have set my name at length to be a mark of infamy to mankind if they shall find i deceive them in one thing i must desire to be forgiven that i talk more sparingly of home affairs as it will be

astrology that the stars do only incline and not force the actions or wills of men and therefore however i may proceed by right rules yet i cannot in prudence so confidently assure the events will follow exactly as i predict them i hope i have maturely considered this objection which in some cases is of no little weight for example a man may by the influence of an over ruling planet be disposed or inclined to lust rage or avarice and yet by the force of reason overcome that bad influence and this was the case of socrates but as the great events of the world usually depend upon numbers of men it cannot be expected they should all unite to cross their inclinations from pursuing a general design wherein they unanimously agree besides the influence of the stars reaches to many actions and events which are not any way in the power of reason as sickness death and what we commonly call accidents with many more needless to repeat but now it is time to proceed to my predictions which i have begun to calculate from the time that the sun enters into aries and this i take to be properly the beginning of the natural year i pursue them to the time that he enters libra or somewhat more which is the busy period of the year the remainder i have not yet adjusted upon account of several impediments needless here to mention besides i must remind the reader again that this is but a specimen of what i design in succeeding years to treat more at large if i may have liberty and encouragement my first prediction is but a trifle yet i will mention it to show how ignorant those sottish pretenders to astrology are in their own concerns it relates to partridge the almanack maker i have consulted the stars of his nativity by my own rules and find he will infallibly die upon the th of march next

crossing at the ferries just as mulford turned away from his commander however a large vessel of that class shoved her bows into the view doubling the hook and going eastward the first glance at this

people it now ceased to be so almost completely with the support which such methods secured along with encouragement from his ministers the king was prepared to put in operation his policy for regulating the affairs of america writs of assistance were followed by the passage of the stamp act the ostensible object of both these measures was to help pay the debt incurred by the french war but the real purpose lay deeper and was nothing more or less than the ultimate extension of parliamentary rule in great things as well as small to america at this crisis so momentous for the colonists the rockingham ministry was formed and burke together with pitt supported a motion for the unconditional repeal of the stamp act after much wrangling the motion was carried and the first blunder of the mother country seemed to have been smoothed over only a few months elapsed however when the question of taxing the colonies was revived pitt lay ill and could take no part in the proposed measure through the influence of other members of his party notably townshend a series of acts were passed imposing duties on several exports to america this was followed by a suspension of the new york assembly because it had disregarded instructions in the matter of supplies for the troops the colonists were furious matters went from bad to worse to withdraw as far as possible without yielding the principle at stake the duties on all the exports mentioned in the bill were removed except that on tea but it was precisely the principle for which the colonists were contending they were not in the humor for compromise when they believed their freedom was endangered and the strength and determination of their resistance found a climax in the boston tea party in the meantime lord north who was absolutely obedient to the king had become prime minister five bills were prepared the tenor of which it was thought would overawe the colonists of these the boston port bill and the regulating act are perhaps the most famous though the ultimate tendency of all was blindly coercive while the king and his friends were busy with these the opposition proposed an unconditional repeal of the tea act the bill was introduced only to be overwhelmingly defeated by the same parliament that passed the five measures of lord north in america the effect of these proceedings was such as might have been expected by thinking men the colonies were as a unit in their support of massachusetts the regulating act was set at defiance public officers in the king s service were forced to resign town meetings were held and preparations for war were begun in dead earnest to avert this some of england s greatest statesmen pitt among the number asked for a reconsideration on february the first a bill was introduced which would have gone far toward bringing peace one month later burke delivered his speech on conciliation with the colonies edmund burke there is nothing unusual in burke s early life he was born in dublin ireland in his father was a successful lawyer and a protestant his mother a catholic at the age of twelve he became a pupil of abraham shackleton a quaker who had been teaching some fifteen years at ballitore a small town thirty miles from dublin in after years burke was always pleased to speak of his old friend in the kindest way if i am anything he declares it is the education i had there that has made me so and again at shackleton s death when burke was near the zenith of his fame and popularity he writes i had a true honor and affection for that excellent man i feel something like a satisfaction in the midst of my concern that i was fortunate enough to have him under my roof before his departure it can hardly be doubted that the old quaker schoolmaster succeeded with his pupil who was already so favorably inclined and it is more than probable that the daily example of one who lived out his precepts was strong in its influence upon a young and generous mind burke attended school at ballitore two years then at the age of fourteen he became a student at trinity college dublin and remained there five years at college he was unsystematic and careless of routine he seems to have done pretty much as he pleased and however methodical he became in after life his study during these five years was rambling and spasmodic the only definite knowledge we have of this period is given by burke himself in letters to his former friend richard shackleton son of his old schoolmaster what he did was done with a zest that at times became a feverish impatience first i was greatly taken with natural philosophy which while i should have given my mind to logic employed me incessantly this i call my furor mathematicus following in succession come his furor logicus furor historicus and furor peoticus each of which absorbed him for the time being it would be wrong however to think of burke as a trifler even in his youth he read in the library three hours every day and we may be sure he read as intelligently as eagerly it is more than probable that like a few other great minds he did not need a rigid system to guide him if he chose his subjects of study at pleasure there is every reason to believe he mastered them of intimate friends at the university we hear nothing goldsmith came one year later but there is no evidence that they knew each other it is probable that burke always reserved had little in common with his young associates his own musings with occasional attempts at writing poetry long walks through the country and frequent letters to and from richard shackleton employed him when not at his books two years after taking his degree burke went to london and established himself at the middle temple for the u\", \"target\":

of their great monarch with an entire overthrow a total eclipse a war which by their own confession it was impossible for them long to have supported the expenses of and which by the great superiority of the allies became dreadful to them and that every campaign more than the other a war which they were in such pain to see the end of that they tried all the powers and courts in christendom who were the least neutral to engage a mediation in order to a treaty and all in vain and a war which if her majesty had not inclined to put an end to must have ended perhaps to the disadvantage and confusion of both france and spain if not of all christendom the obligations the french are under for the bringing this war to so just and honourable a conclusion are not at all concealed nay the french

whereof many i suppose fell on my body though i felt them not and some on my face which i immediately covered with my left hand when this shower of arrows was over i fell a groaning with grief and

for above an hour like that of people at work when turning my head that way as well as the pegs and strings would permit me i saw a stage erected about a foot and a half from the ground capable of holding four of the inhabitants with two or three ladders to mount it from whence one of them who seemed to be a person of quality made me a long speech whereof i understood not one syllable but i should have mentioned that before the principal person began his oration he cried out three times langro dehul san these words and the former were afterwards repeated and explained to me whereupon immediately about fifty of the inhabitants came and cut the strings that fastened the left side of my head which gave me the liberty of turning it to the right and of observing the person and gesture

them into broad lakes on either side of the road this may have been to some degree in our favour as shielding us from the raids of the king s cavalry but it made our march very slow all day it was splashing and swashing through mud and mire the rain drops shining on the gun barrels and dripping from the heavy footed horses past the swollen parret through eastover by the peaceful village of bawdrip and over polden hill we made our way until the bugles sounded a halt under the groves of ashcot and a rude meal was served out to the men then on again through the pitiless rain past the

praise of dryden a man for learning and universal writing in poetry perhaps the greatest that england has produc d p l and his comment upon the critical detraction from which he suffered he compares pope interestingly enough with dryden remarking that pope a person tho inferior to mr dryden yet speaking impartially has few superiors in this age also is persecuted by envy and he has generous praise for that poet s translation of homer one may note that defoe avoids the shortcomings of the critics whom he condemns for judging according to party he distributes his praise indiscriminately between whig and tory writers in short his essay hardly does more than confirm the critical commonplaces of the time and attest to the catholicity of the author s taste of particular interest for students of defoe is the paragraph p l in which defoe defends the hack writers who must write for subsistence one should not expect their writings which are necessarily numerous to be as correct and finished as they might be after comparing their pens to prostitutes because of their venality he claims in a half ironic tone for both authors and booksellers the liberty of writing and printing for either or both sides without ignominy after all they must write and print to live such practice is certainly he observes no more unjust or disreputable than other ways of gaining wealth such as one finds in exchange alley this paragraph gains point when one remembers that defoe had served both whig and tory governments in as letters written to lord stanhope in that very year testify he was engaged in the perhaps dubious business of masquerading as a tory while actually in the service of the whig ministry to take the sting out of the more violent tory periodicals and he was much concerned with the danger of his ambiguous position in december of he had been identified as a writer for mist s weekly journal the leading tory paper and was subjected to growing attacks in the whig press one can hardly doubt that this paragraph is a thinly veiled defense of his own practice as a professional journalist it is no surprise to find the author of a vindication in discussing the qualifications of writers advocating the importance of genius and natural parts above mere learning he instances the author of the true born englishman and shakespeare the former characteriz d as a person of little learning but of prodigious natural parts and the latter having but a small share of literature the further example of the literary achievements of the fair sex who had of course no university education reminds one of defoe s championship elsewhere of women the business of a writer is to please and inform and the general implication is that genius is more necessary to this end than learning also characteristic of defoe is his emphasis upon the advantage to an author of conversation the aliment of genius the life of all airy performances p likewise his digression upon education pp f his charge that people of quality in england all too often neglect their children s education his remarks upon the advantages of travel and the need of training in the vernacular all

evidence of his pride in authorship of his rationalization of his actions as a professional journalist and of his belief in the importance of a free press many of his characteristic ideas are repeated with his usual consistency in point of view although the critical comments in the essay are thoroughly conventional they offer evidence of contemporary literary judgments and reveal defoe as a well informed man of moderation and commonsense though certainly not as a profound critic in the catholicity of his tastes and interests defoe is far ahead of his puritan fellows and his essay may be taken as one indication of the growing interest of the middle classes for whom he wrote in the greater world of literature as professor trent remarks in his ms notes defoe rarely wrote a tract without

it is known are not to be bought it is unjust in its motives its means and its end the measure is discreditable to civilization and an outrage on liberty but the other law mentioned is an atrocity so

some errors of the press that have escaped a short chronicle from the first memory of things in europe to the conquest of persia by alexander the great the introduction the greek antiquities are full of poetical fictions because the greeks wrote nothing in prose before the conquest of asia by cyrus the persian then pherecydes scyrius and cadmus milesius introduced the writing in prose pherecydes atheniensis about the end of the reign of darius hystaspis wrote of antiquities and digested his work by genealogies and was reckoned one of the best genealogers epimenides the historian proceeded also by genealogies and hellanicus who was twelve years older than herodotus digested his history by the ages or successions of the priestesses of juno argiva others digested theirs by the kings of the laced monians or archons of athens hippias the elean about thirty years before the fall of the persian empire published a breviary or list of the olympic victors and about ten years before the fall thereof ephorus the disciple of isocrates formed a chronological history of greece beginning with the return of the heraclides into peloponnesus and ending with the siege of perinthus in the twentieth year of philip the father of alexander the great but he digested things by generations and the reckoning by olympiads was not yet in use nor doth it appear that the reigns of kings were yet set down by numbers of years the arundelian marbles were composed sixty years after the death of alexander the great an olymp and yet mention not the olympiads but in the next olympiad tim us siculus published an history in several books down to his own times according to the olympiads comparing the ephori the kings of sparta the archons of athens and the priestesses of argos with the olympic victors so as to make the olympiads and the genealogies and successions of kings archons and priestesses and poetical histories suit with one another according to the best of his judgment and where he

putting reigns and successions equipollent to generations and three generations to an hundred or an hundred and twenty years as appears by their chronology they have made the antiquities of greece

equal contempt he brands him as the slave of the most miserable and narrow prejudices or as the defender of the abuses of civil society only because he profits by them he paints him either as a character who prostitutes his understanding to his interest or as one whose powers of mind are not of a size to grasp any thing great and noble who cannot see above five yards before him and who must therefore be utterly unable to take in the views of the enlightened benefactor of mankind in this unamicable contest the cause of truth cannot but suffer the really good arguments on each side of the question are not allowed to have their proper weight each pursues his own theory little solicitous to correct or improve it by an attention to what is advanced by his opponents the friend of the present order of things condemns all political speculations in the gross he will not even condescend to examine the grounds from which the perfectibility of society is inferred much less will he give himself the trouble in a fair and candid manner to attempt an exposition of their fallacy the speculative philosopher equally offends against the cause of truth with eyes fixed on a happier state of society the blessings of which he paints in the most captivating colours he allows himself to indulge in the most bitter invectives against every present establishment without applying his talents to consider the best and safest means of removing abuses and without seeming to be aware of the tremendous obstacles that threaten even in theory to oppose the progress of man towards perfection it is an acknowledged truth in philosophy that a just theory will always be confirmed by experiment yet so much friction and so many minute circumstances occur in practice which it is next to impossible for the most enlarged and penetrating mind to foresee that on few subjects can any theory be pronounced just till all the arguments against it have been maturely weighed and clearly and consistently refuted i have read some of the speculations on the perfectibility of man and of society with great pleasure i have been warmed and delighted with the enchanting picture which they hold forth i ardently wish for such happy improvements but i see great and to my understanding unconquerable difficulties in the way to them these difficulties it is my present purpose to state declaring at the same time that so far from exulting in them as a cause of triumph over the friends of innovation nothing would give me greater pleasure than to see them completely removed the most important argument that i shall adduce is certainly not new the principles on which it depends have been explained in part by hume and more at large by dr adam smith it has been advanced and applied to the present subject though not with its proper weight or in the most forcible point of view by mr wallace and it may probably have been stated by many writers that i have never met with i should certainly therefore not think of advancing it again though i mean to place it in a point of view in some degree different from any that i have hitherto seen if it had ever been fairly and satisfactorily answered the cause of this neglect on the part of the advocates for the perfectibility of mankind is not easily accounted for i cannot doubt the talents of such men as godwin and condorcet i am unwilling to doubt their candour to my understanding and probably to that of most others the difficulty appears insurmountable yet these men of acknowledged ability and penetration scarcely deign to notice it and hold on their course in such speculations with unabated ardour and undiminished confidence i have certainly no right to say that they purposely shut their eyes to such arguments i ought rather to doubt the validity of them when neglected by such men however forcibly their truth may strike my own mind yet in this respect it must be acknowledged that we are all of us too prone to err if i saw a glass of wine repeatedly presented to a man and he took no notice of it i should be apt to think that he was blind or uncivil a juster philosophy might teach me rather to think that my eyes deceived me and that the offer was not really what i conceived it to be in entering upon the argument i must premise that i put out of the question at present all mere conjectures that is all suppositions the probable realization of which cannot be inferred upon any just philosophical grounds a writer may tell me that he thinks man will ultimately become an ostrich i cannot properly contradict him but before he can expect to bring any reasonable person over to his opinion he ought to shew that the necks of mankind have been gradually elongating that the lips have grown harder and more prominent that the legs and feet are daily altering their shape and that the hair is beginning to change into stubs of feathers and till the probability of so wonderful a conversion can be shewn it is surely lost time and lost eloquence to expatiate on the happiness of man in such a state to describe his powers both of running and flying to paint him in a condition where all narrow luxuries would be contemned where he would be employed only in collecting the necessaries of life and where consequently each man s share of labour would be light and his portion of leisure ample i think i may

by new measures and to steer a course that was never attempted yet and his design in our voyage was to make like discoveries towards the south pole where as he said and gave us very good reasons for

her to look for joys beyond those of her present life and home when love and marriage should come to her as come they probably might she would endeavour to attune herself to a new happiness and a new sphere of duties in the meantime she was contented to keep her mother s accounts and look after her brother and sister up two pair of stairs in the ludwigs strasse but change would certainly come we may prophesy for isa heine was a beautiful girl tall and graceful comely to the eye and fit in every way to be loved and cherished as the partner of a man s home i have said that an english clerk made a part of that small establishment in the dingy banking office in the schrannen platz and i must say a word or two of herbert onslow in his early career he had not been fortunate his father with means sufficiently moderate and with a family more than sufficiently large had sent him to a public school at which he had been very idle and then to one of the universities at which he had run into debt and had therefore left without a degree when this occurred a family council of war had been held among the onslows and it was decided that herbert should be sent off to the banking house of heines at munich there being a cousinship between the families and some existing connections of business it was therefore so settled and herbert willing enough to see the world as he considered he should do by going to munich started for his german home with injunctions very tender from his mother and very solemn from his aggrieved father but there was nothing bad at the heart about young onslow and if the solemn father had well considered it he might perhaps have felt that those debts at cambridge reflected more fault on him than on his son when herbert arrived at munich his cousins the heines far away cousins though they were behaved kindly to him they established him at first in lodgings where he was boarded with many others having heard somewhat of his early youth but when madame heine at the end of twelve months perceived that he was punctual at the bank and that his allowances which though moderate in england were handsome in munich carried him on without debt she opened her motherly arms and suggested to his mother and to himself that he should live with them in this way he also was domiciled up two pairs of stairs in the palatial residence in the ludwigs strasse but all this happened long ago isa heine had been only seventeen when her cousin had first come to munich and had made acquaintance with him rather as a child than as a woman and when as she ripened into womanhood this young man came more closely among them it did not strike her that the change would affect her more powerfully than it would the others her uncle and father she knew had approved of herbert at the bank and herbert had shown that he could be steady therefore he was to be taken into their family paying his annual subsidy instead of being left with strangers at the boarding house all this was very simple to her she assisted in mending his linen as she did her father s she visited his room daily as she visited all the others she took notice of his likings and dislikings as touching their table arrangement but by no means such notice as she did of her father s and without any flutter inwardly in her imagination or outwardly as regarded the world she made him one of the family so things went on for a year nay so things went on for two years with her after herbert onslow had come to the ludwigs strasse but the matter had been regarded in a very different light by herbert himself when the proposition had been made to him his first idea had been that so close a connection with a girl so very pretty would be delightful he had blushed as he had given in his adhesion but madame heine when

the facilities of intercourse the spirit of the age and the equalizing sentiment that marks the civilization of the epoch will greatly hasten everything in the shape of improvement new york will probably never possess any churches of an architecture to attract attention for their magnitude and magnificence the policy of the country which separates religion from the state precludes this by confining all the expenditures of this nature to the several parishes few of which are rich enough to do more than erect edifices of moderate dimensions and cost the romish church so much addicted to addressing the senses manifests some desire to construct its cathedrals but they are necessarily confined to the limits and ornaments suited to the resources of a branch of the church that in this country is by no means affluent the manner in which the americans are subdivided into sects also conflicts with any commendable desire that may exist to build glorious temples in honor of the deity and convenience is more consulted than taste perhaps in all that relates to ecclesiastical architecture nevertheless a sensible improvement in this respect has occurred within the last few years to which we shall elsewhere advert it will be in their trade their resources their activity and their influence on the rest of the world as well as in their population that the towns of manhattan will be first entitled to rank with the larger capitals of europe so obvious rapid and natural has been the advance of all the places that it is not easy for the mind to regard anything belonging to them as extraordinary or out of rule there is not a port in the whole country that is less indebted to art and the fostering hand of government than this it is true certain forts most of them of very doubtful necessity have been constructed for defence but no attack having ever been contemplated or if contemplated attempted they have been dead letters in the history of its progress we are not aware that government has ever expended one cent in the waters of manhattan except for the surveys construction of the aforesaid military works and the erection of the lighthouses that form a part of the general provision for the safe navigation of the entire coast some money has been expended for the improvement of the shallow waters of the hudson but it has been as much or more for the advantage of the upper towns and the trade coastwise generally than for the special benefit of new york the immense natural advantages of the bays and islands at the mouth of the hudson have in a great degree superseded the necessity of such assistance nature has made every material provision for a mart of the first importance and perhaps it has been fortunate that the towns have been left like healthful and vigorous children managed by prudent parents to take the inclination and growth pointed out to them by this safest and best of guides london is indebted to artificial causes in a great degree for its growth and power that great law of trade which renders settling places indispensable has contributed to her prosperity and continued ascendency long after the day when rival ports are carrying away her fleets and commerce she is a proof of the difficulty of shaking a commercial superiority long established scarce a cargo that enters the ports of the kingdom that does not pay tribute to her bankers or merchants but london is a political capital and that in a country where the representation of the government is more imposing possessing greater influence than in any other christian nation the english aristocracy which wields the real authority of the state here makes its annual exhibition of luxury and wealth such as the world has never beheld anywhere else ancient rome possibly excepted and has had a large share in rendering london what it is new york has none of this adventitious aid both of the governments that of the united states and that of the state have long been taken from her leaving her nothing of this sort but her own local authorities but representation forms no part of the machinery of american policy it is supposed that man is too intellectual and philosophical to need it in this intellectual and philosophical country par excellence although such is the theory the whole struggle in private life is limited to the impression made by representation in the hands of individuals that which the government has improvidently cast aside society has seized upon and hundreds who have no claim to distinction beyond the possession of money profit by the mistake to place themselves in positions perhaps that they are not always exactly qualified to fill of all social usurpations that of mere money is the least tolerable as one may have a very full purse with empty brains and vulgar tastes and habits the wisdom of thus throwing the control of a feature of society that is of much more moment than is commonly supposed into the chapter of

mrs norris interrupted him with a reply to them all whether stated or not my dear sir thomas i perfectly comprehend you and do justice to the generosity and delicacy of your notions which indeed are quite of a piece with your general conduct and i entirely agree with you in the main as to the propriety of doing everything one could by way of providing for a child one had in a manner taken into one s own hands and i am sure i should be the last person in the world to withhold my mite upon such an occasion having no children of my own who should i look to in any little matter i may ever have to bestow but the children of my sisters and i am sure mr norris is too just but you know i am a woman of few words and professions do not let us be frightened from a good deed by a trifle give a girl an education and introduce her properly into the world and ten to one but she has the means of settling well without farther expense to anybody a niece of ours sir thomas i may say or at least of yours would not grow up in this neighbourhood without many advantages i don t say she would be so handsome as her cousins i dare say she would not but she would be introduced into the society of this country under such very favourable circumstances as in all human probability would get her a creditable establishment you are thinking of your sons but do not you know that of all things upon earth that is the least likely to happen brought up as they would be always together like brothers and sisters it is morally impossible i never knew an instance of it it is in fact the only sure way of providing against the connexion suppose her a pretty girl and seen by tom or edmund for the first time seven years hence and i dare say there would be mischief the very idea of her having been suffered to grow up at a distance from us all in poverty and neglect would be enough to make either of the dear sweet tempered boys in love with her but breed her up with them from this time and suppose her even to have the beauty of an angel and she will never be more to either than a sister there is a great deal of truth in what you say replied sir thomas and far be it from me to throw any fanciful impediment in the way of a plan which would be so consistent with the relative situations of each i only meant to observe that it ought not to be lightly engaged in and that to make it really serviceable to mrs price and creditable to ourselves we must secure to the child or consider ourselves engaged to secure to her hereafter as circumstances may arise the provision of a gentlewoman if no such establishment should offer as you are so sanguine in expecting i thoroughly understand you cried mrs norris you are everything that is generous and considerate and i am sure we shall never disagree on this point whatever i can do as you well know i am always ready enough to do for the good of those i love and though i could never feel for this little girl the hundredth part of the regard i bear your own dear children nor consider her in any respect so much my own i should hate myself if i were capable of neglecting her is not she a sister s child and could i bear to see her want while i had a bit of bread to give her my dear sir thomas with all my faults i have a warm heart and poor as i am would rather deny myself the necessaries of life than do an ungenerous thing so if you are not against it i will write to my poor sister tomorrow and make the proposal and as soon as matters are settled i will engage to get the child to mansfield you shall have no trouble about it my own trouble you know i never regard i will send nanny to london on purpose and she may have a bed at her cousin the saddler s and the child be appointed to meet her there they may easily get her from portsmouth to town by the coach under the care of any creditable person that may chance to be going i dare say there is always some reputable tradesman s wife or other going up except to the attack on nanny s cousin sir thomas no longer made any objection and a more respectable though less economical rendezvous being accordingly substituted everything was considered as settled and the pleasures of so benevolent a scheme were already enjoyed the division of gratifying sensations ought not in strict justice to have been equal for sir thomas was fully resolved to be the real and consistent patron of the selected child and mrs norris had not the least intention of being at any expense whatever in her maintenance as far as walking talking and contriving reached she was thoroughly benevolent and nobody knew better how to dictate liberality to others but her love of money was equal to her love of directing and she knew quite as well how to save her own as to spend that of her friends having married on a narrower income than she had been used to look forward to she had from the first fancied a very strict line of economy necessary and what was begun as a matter of prudence soon grew into a matter of choice as an object of that needful solicitude which there were no children to supply had there been a family to provide for mrs norris might never have saved her money but having no care of that kind there was nothing to impede her frugality or lessen the comfort of making a yearly addition to an income which they had never lived up to under this infatuating principle counteracted by no real affection for her sister it was impossible for her to aim at more than the credit of projecting and arranging so expensive a charity though perhaps she might so little know herself as to walk home to the parsonage after this conversation in the happy belief of being the most liberal minded sister and aunt i\", \"target\": 1, \"compound\": 0.9994,

we now speak success is the only test of merit words have lost their old significance and to deserve only is not meritorious v victis there are so many of them thompson says johnson the young poet when he has at last succeeded in getting the bosomest of his friends alone into his chamber with him have you happened to look at my iphigenia yet thompson can t say that he has he has been busy has had so many water parties and then somehow he doesn t think that he is very partial to modern poetry on subjects of old mythology of course however he means to read it some of these days i wish you would says johnson tendering a copy of the thin volume i really wish you would and let me have your candid opinion the press certainly have not noticed it much and what they have said has been very luke warm i am sorry for that says thompson looking grave and i did my best with it too you would hardly believe how hard i worked at it there is not a line that has not been weighed and written perhaps three times over i do not think i am conceited but i cannot but believe that there is something in it the reviewers are so jealous if a man has not a name they will give him credit for nothing and it is so hard to begin i am sure it is says thompson i don t expect fame and as for money of course i don t think of that but i should like to know that it had been read by one or two persons who could understand it i have given to it the best of my time the best of my labour i cannot but think that there is something in it thus pleads the unsuccessful one for mercy and thus answers to him the successful one with no grain of mercy in his composition my dear johnson my maxim is this that in this world every man gets in the long run exactly what he deserves did milton get what he deserved these are not the days of milton i don t want to hurt your feelings but old friends as we are i should not forgive myself if i didn t tell you what i really think poetry is all very well but you can t create a taste for it if it doesn t exist nobody that i know of cares a d for iphigenia you think i should change my subject then to tell you the truth i think you should change your trade this is the third attempt you know i dare say they are very good in their way but if the world liked them the world would have found it out by this time vox populi vox dei that is my motto i don t trust my own judgment i trust that of the public if you will take my advice you will give up iphigenia and the rest of them you see you are doing nothing whatever at the bar c c and thus johnson is left without a scrap of comfort a word of consolation a spark of sympathy and yet he had given to that iphigenia of his the best that was in him to give had his publisher sold ten thousand copies of it how thompson would have admired it how he would have pressed the poet in his arms and have given him champagne up at richmond but who now has sympathy for failure to fail is to be disgraced v victis there is something very painful in these races which we english are always running to one who has tenderness enough to think of the nine beaten horses instead of the one who has conquered look at that list

gravesend accordingly one of the gentlemen of the committee before leaving the vessel invited the captain and officers to attend and to my astonishment and delight also begged me to honour them with my company i accepted the invitation with extreme politeness and from inability to express my joy in any other way winked to my friend wiseacre with whom i had become by this time pretty familiar he being also invited winked in return to me and having disposed of this piece of juvenile freemasonry to our satisfaction we assisted the crew in giving three hearty cheers as the little steamer darted from the side and proceeded to the shore the dinner like all other public dinners was as good and substantial as a lavish expenditure of cash could make it but really my recollections of it are very indistinct the ceaseless din of plates glasses knives forks and tongues was tremendous and this together with the novelty of the scene the heat of the room and excellence of the viands tended to render me oblivious of much that took place almost all the faces present were strange to me who were and who were not the gentlemen of the committee was to me matter of the most perfect indifference and as no one took the trouble to address me in particular i confined myself to the interesting occupation of trying to make sense of a conversation held by upwards of fifty pairs of lungs at one and the same time nothing intelligible however was to be heard except when a sudden lull in the noise gave a bald headed old gentleman near the head of the table an opportunity of drinking the health of a red faced old gentleman near the foot upon whom he bestowed an amount of flattery perfectly bewildering and after making the unfortunate red faced gentleman writhe for half an hour in a fever of modesty sat down amid thunders of applause whether the applause by the way was intended for the speaker or the speakee i do not know but being quite indifferent i clapped my hands with the rest the red faced gentleman now purple with excitement then rose and during a solemn silence delivered himself of a speech to the effect that the day then passing was certainly the happiest in his mortal career that he could not find words adequately to express the varied feelings which swelled his throbbing bosom and that he felt quite faint with the mighty load of honour just thrown upon his delighted shoulders by his bald headed friend the red faced gentleman then sat down to the national air of rat tat tat played in full chorus with knives forks spoons nut crackers and knuckles on the polished surface of the mahogany table we left the dinner table at a late hour and after i in company with some other youngsters had done as much mischief as we conveniently could without risking our

or six days i know not the demon of sea sickness had completely prostrated my faculties bodily and mental some faint recollections i have of stormy weather horrible noises and hurried dinners but the

the age of twenty seven had found the miseries of the world to be too many for him and had put an end to them and to himself charles had been a clever fellow a very clever fellow in the eyes of his father bernard amedroz knew that he himself was not a clever fellow and admired his son accordingly and when charles had been expelled from harrow for some boyish freak in his vengeance against a neighbouring farmer who had reported to the school authorities the doings of a few beagles upon his land charles had cut off the heads of all the trees in a young fir plantation his father was proud of the exploit when he was rusticated a second time from trinity and when the father received an intimation that his son s name had better be taken from the college books the squire was not so well pleased but even then he found some delight in the stories which reached him of his son s vagaries and when the young man commenced bohemian life in london his father did nothing to restrain him then there came the old story debts endless debts and lies endless lies during the two years before his death his father paid for him or undertook to pay nearly ten thousand pounds sacrificing the life assurances which were to have made provision for his daughter sacrificing to a great extent his own life income sacrificing everything so that the property might not be utterly ruined at his death that charles amedroz should be a brighter greater man than any other amedroz had still been the father s pride at the last visit which charles had paid to belton his father had called upon him to pledge himself solemnly that his sister should not be made to suffer by what had been done for him within a month of that time he had blown his brains out in his london lodgings thus making over the entire property to will belton at his father s death at that last pretended settlement with his father and his father s lawyer he had kept back the mention of debts as heavy nearly as those to which he had owned and there were debts of honour too of which he had not spoken trusting to the next event at newmarket to set him right the next event at newmarket had set him more wrong than ever and so there had come an end to everything with charles amedroz this had happened in the spring and the afflicted father afflicted with the double sorrow of his son s terrible death and his daughter s ruin had declared that he would turn his face to the wall and die but the old squire s health though far from strong was stronger than he had deemed it and his feelings sharp enough were less sharp than he had thought them and when a month had passed by he had discovered that it would be better that he should live in order that his daughter might still have bread to eat and a house of her own over her head though he was now an impoverished man there was still left to him the means of keeping up the old home and he told himself that it must if possible be so kept that a few pounds annually might be put by for clara the old carriage horses were sold and the park was let to a farmer up to the hall door of the castle so much the squire could do but as to the putting by of the few pounds any dependence on such exertion as that on his part would we may say be very precarious belton castle was not in truth a castle immediately before the front door so near to the house as merely to allow of a broad road running between it and the entrance porch there stood an old tower which gave its name to the residence an old square tower up which the amedroz boys for three generations had been able to climb by means of the ivy and broken stones in one of the inner corners and this tower was a remnant of a real castle that had once protected the village of belton the house itself was an ugly residence three stories high built in the time of george ii with low rooms and long passages and an immense number of doors it was a large unattractive house unattractive that is as regarded its own attributes but made interesting by the beauty of the small park in which it stood belton park did not perhaps contain much above a hundred acres but the land was so broken into knolls and valleys in so many places was the rock seen to be cropping up through the verdure there were in it so many stunted old oaks so many points of vantage for the lover of scenery that no one would believe it to be other than a considerable domain the farmer who took it and who would not under any circumstances undertake to pay more than seventeen shillings an acre for it could not be made to think that it was in any way considerable but belton park since first it was made a park had never before been regarded after this fashion farmer stovey of the grange was the first man of that class who had ever assumed the right to pasture his sheep in belton chase as the people around were still accustomed to call the woodlands of the estate it was full summer at belton and four months had now passed since

again to be seen walking among the oaks in the park on a sunday evening and the world in that district of somersetshire was getting itself back into its grooves the fate of the young heir had

out within five days his father was to be dead within no he rejected that view of the subject the ministry were to be out and the diocese might probably be vacant at the same period there was much doubt as to the names of the men who were to succeed to power and a week must elapse before a cabinet was formed would not vacancies be filled by the outgoing men during this week dr grantly had a kind of idea that such would be the case but did not know and then he wondered at his own ignorance on such a question he tried to keep his mind away from the subject but he could not the race was so very close and the stakes were so very high he then looked at the dying man s impassive placid face there was no sign there of death or disease it was something thinner than of yore somewhat grayer and the deep lines of age more marked but as far as he could judge life might yet hang there for weeks to come sir lamda mewnew and sir omicron pie had thrice been wrong and might yet be wrong thrice again the old bishop slept during twenty of the twenty four hours but during the short periods of his waking moments he knew both his son and his dear old friend mr harding the archdeacon s father in law and would thank them tenderly for their care and love now he lay sleeping like a baby resting easily on his back his mouth just open and his few gray hairs straggling from beneath his cap his breath was perfectly noiseless and his thin wan hand which lay above the coverlid never moved nothing could be easier than the old man s passage from this world to the next but by no means easy were the emotions of him who sat there watching he knew it must be now or never he was already over fifty and there was little chance that his friends who were now leaving office would soon return to it no probable british prime minister but he who was now in he who was so soon to be out would think of making a bishop of dr grantly thus he thought long and sadly in deep silence and then gazed at that still living face and then at last dared to ask himself whether he really longed for his father s death the effort was a salutary one and the question was answered in a moment the proud wishful worldly man sank on his knees by the bedside and taking the bishop s hand within his own prayed eagerly that his sins might be forgiven him his face was still buried in the clothes when the door of the bedroom opened noiselessly and mr harding entered with a velvet step mr harding s attendance at that bedside had been nearly as constant as that of the archdeacon and his ingress and egress was as much a matter of course as that of his son in law he was standing close beside the archdeacon before he was perceived and would also have knelt in prayer had he not feared that his doing so might have caused some sudden start and have disturbed the dying man dr grantly however instantly perceived him and rose from his knees as he did so mr harding took both his hands and pressed them warmly there was more fellowship between them at that moment than there had ever been before and it so happened that after circumstances greatly preserved the feeling as they stood there pressing each other s hands the tears rolled freely down their cheeks god bless you my dears said the bishop with feeble voice as he woke god bless you may god bless you both my dear children and so he died there was no loud rattle in the throat no dreadful struggle no palpable sign of death but the lower jaw fell a little from its place and the eyes which had been so constantly closed in sleep now remained fixed and open neither mr harding nor dr grantly knew that life was gone though both suspected it i believe it s all over said mr harding still pressing the other s hands i think nay i hope it is i will ring the bell said the other speaking all but in a whisper mrs phillips should be here mrs phillips the nurse was soon in the room and immediately with practised hand closed those staring eyes it s all

great relief archdeacon said mr harding a great relief dear good excellent old man oh that our last moments may be as innocent and as peaceful as his surely said mrs phillips the lord be praised for all his mercies but for a meek mild gentle spoken christian his lordship was and mrs phillips with unaffected but easy grief put up her white apron to her flowing eyes you cannot but rejoice that it is over said mr harding still consoling his friend the archdeacon s mind however had already travelled from the death chamber to the closet of the prime minister he had brought himself to pray for his father s life but now that that life was done minutes were too precious to be lost it was now useless to dally with the fact of the bishop s death useless to lose perhaps everything for the pretence of a foolish sentiment but how was he to act while his father in law stood there holding his hand how without appearing unfeeling was he to forget his father in the bishop to overlook what he had lost

intended for man who should be content to dwell under the shade of its groves though the roots thereof descend into the darkness of the earth but my lord you well know that there are those in mardi who secretly regard all stories connected with this peak as inventions of the people of maramma they deny that any thing is to be gained by making a pilgrimage thereto and for warranty they appeal to the sayings of the great prophet alma cried mohi but alma is also quoted by others in vindication of the pilgrimages to ofo they declare that the prophet himself was the first pilgrim that thitherward journeyed that from thence he departed to the skies now excepting this same peak maramma is all rolling hill and dale like the sea after a storm which then seems not to roll but to stand still poising its mountains yet the landscape of maramma has not the merriness of meadows partly because of the shadow of ofo and partly because of the solemn groves in which the morais and temples are buried according to mohi not one solitary tree bearing fruit not one esculent root grows in all the isle the population wholly depending upon the large tribute remitted from the neighboring shores it is not that the soil is unproductive said mohi that these things are so it is extremely fertile but the inhabitants say that it would be wrong to make a bread fruit orchard of the holy island and hence my

of reverence our paddlers also stripped to the waist an example which even media followed though as a king the same homage he rendered was at times rendered himself at every place hitherto visited joyous crowds stood ready to hail our arrival but the shores of maramma were silent and forlorn said babbalanja it looks not as if the lost one were here at length we landed in a little cove nigh a valley which mohi called uma and here in silence we beached our canoes but presently there came to us an old man with a beard white as the mane of the pale horse he was clad in a midnight robe he fanned himself with a fan of faded leaves a child led him by the hand for he was blind wearing a green plantain leaf over his plaited brow him media accosted making mention who we were and on what errand we came to seek out yillah and behold the isle whereupon pani for such was his name gave us a courteous reception and lavishly promised to discover sweet yillah declaring that in maramma if any where the long lost maiden must be found he assured us that throughout the whole land he would lead us leaving no place desirable to be searched unexplored and so saying he conducted us to his dwelling for refreshment and repose it was large and lofty near by however were many miserable hovels with squalid inmates but the old man s retreat was exceedingly comfortable especially abounding in mats for lounging his rafters were bowed down by calabashes of good cheer during the repast which ensued blind pani freely partaking enlarged upon the merit of abstinence declaring that a thatch overhead and a cocoanut tree comprised all that was necessary for the temporal welfare of a mardian more than this he assured us was sinful he now made known that he officiated as guide in this quarter of the country and that as he had renounced all other pursuits to devote himself to showing strangers the island and more particularly the best way to ascend lofty ofo he was necessitated to seek remuneration for his toil my lord then whispered mohi to media the great prophet alma always declared that without charge this island was free to all what recompense do you desire old man said media to path what i seek is but little twenty rolls of fine tappa two score mats of best upland grass one canoe load of bread fruit and yams ten gourds of wine and forty strings of teeth you are a

hold that much desired office four months after his appointment such cessation however arising from political causes is no disappointment to a man it will doubtless be the case that a man so placed will regret the weakness of his party which has been unable to keep the good things of government in its hands but he will recognise without remorse or sorrow the fact that the ministry to which he has attached himself must cease to be a ministry and there will be nothing in his displacement to gall his pride or to create that inner feeling of almost insupportable mortification which comes from the conviction of personal failure sir thomas underwood had been solicitor general for a few months under a conservative prime minister and when the conservative minister went out of office sir thomas underwood followed him with no feeling of regret that caused him unhappiness but when afterwards the same party came back to power and he having lost his election at the borough which he had represented was passed over without a word of sympathy or even of assumed regret from the minister then he was wounded it was true he knew that a man to be solicitor general should have a seat in parliament the highest legal offices in the country are not to be attained by any amount of professional excellence unless the candidate shall have added to such excellence the power of supporting a ministry and a party in the house of commons sir thomas underwood thoroughly understood this but he knew also that there are various ways in which a lame dog may be helped over a stile if only the lame dog be popular among dogs for another ex solicitor general a seat would have been found or some delay would have been granted or at least there would have been a consultation with a suggestion that something should be tried but in this case a man four years his junior in age whom he despised and who as he was informed had obtained his place in parliament by gross bribery was put into the office without a word of apology to him then he was unhappy and acknowledged to himself that his spirit was crushed but he acknowledged to himself at the same time that he was one doomed by his nature to such crushing of the spirit if he came out of the hole of his solitude and endeavoured to carry on the open fight of life among his fellow men he knew that he was one doomed to that disappointment the bitterest of all which comes from failure when the prize has been all but reached it is much to have become solicitor general and that he had achieved but it is worse than nothing to have been solicitor general for four months and then to find that all the world around one regards one as having failed and as being therefore fit for the shelf such were sir thomas underwood s feelings as he sat alone in his chambers during those days in which the new administration was formed in which days he was neither consulted nor visited nor communicated with either by message or by letter but all this this formation of a ministry in which the late solicitor general was not invited to take a part occurred seven years before the commencement of our story during those years in which our lawyer sat in parliament as mr underwood at which time he was working hard also as a chancery barrister and was perhaps nearer to his fellow men than he had ever been before or was ever destined to be afterwards he resided as regarded himself almost nominally at a small but pretty villa which he had taken for his wife s sake at fulham it was close upon the river and had well arranged though not extensive shrubbery walks and a little lawn and a tiny conservatory and a charming opening down to the thames mrs underwood had found herself unable to live in half moon street and mr underwood not unwillingly had removed his household gods to this retreat at that time his household gods consisted of a wife and two daughters but the wife had died before the time came at which she could have taken on herself the name of lady underwood the villa at fulham was still kept and there lived the two girls and there also sir thomas had he been interrogated on the subject would have declared that he also was domiciled but if a man lives at the place in which he most often sleeps sir thomas in truth lived at his chambers at southampton buildings when he moved those household gods of his to the villa it was necessary because of his duties in parliament that he should have some place in town wherein he might lay his head and therefore i fear not unwillingly he took to laying his head very frequently in the little bedroom which was attached to his chambers it is not necessary that we should go back to any feelings which might have operated upon him during his wife s lifetime or during the period of his parliamentary career his wife was now dead and he no longer held a seat in parliament he had indeed all but abandoned his practice at the bar never putting himself forward for the ordinary business of a chancery barrister but nevertheless he spent the largest half of his life in his chambers breakfasting there reading there writing there and sleeping there he did not altogether desert the lodge at fulham and the two girls who lived there he would not even admit to them or allow them to assert that he had not his home with them sometimes for two nights together and sometimes for three he would be at the villa never remaining there however during the day but on sundays it may almost be said that he was never at home and hence arose the feeling that of all this went the nearest to create discord between the father and the daughters sir thomas was always in southampton buildings on sundays did sir thomas go to church the miss underwoods did\", \"target\": 2,

are you a miller the girl laughed she was a very good humored girl and did not appear to be displeased though it certainly was not quite proper for marco to speak in that manner to a stranger she did not however reply to his question but said after a pause do you know where the montpelier stage is the proper english meaning of the word stage is a portion of the road traveled between one resting place and another but in the united states it is used to mean the carriage being a sort of contraction for stage coach no said marco we are going in that stage i wish it would come along said the girl for i m tired of watching my trunk where is your trunk said marco so the girl pointed out her trunk it was upon the platform of the piazza near those belonging to forester and marco the girl showed marco her name which was mary williams written on a card upon the end of it i ll watch your trunk said marco and you can go in and sit down until the stage comes mary thanked him and went in she was not however quite sure that her baggage was safe intrusted thus to the charge of a strange boy and so she took a seat near the window where she could keep an eye upon it there was a blue chest near these trunks which looked like a sailor s chest and marco being tired of standing sat down upon this chest he had however scarcely taken his seat when he saw a coach with four horses coming round a corner it was driven by a small boy not larger than marco it wheeled up toward the door and came to a stand some men then put on the sailor s chest and the trunks mary williams came out and got into the coach she sat on the back seat forester and marco got in and took their places on the middle seat a young man dressed like a sailor took the front seat at one corner of the coach these were all the passengers that were to get in here when every thing was ready they drove away the stage stopped however in a few minutes at the door of a handsome house in the town and took a gentleman and lady in these new passengers took places on the back seat with mary williams this company rode in perfect silence for some time forester took out a book and began to read the gentleman on the back seat went to sleep mary williams and marco looked out at the windows watching the changing scenery the sailor rode in silence moving his lips now and then as if he were talking to himself but taking no notice of any of the company the coach stopped at the villages which they passed through to exchange the mail and sometimes to take in new passengers in the course of these changes marco got his place shifted to the forward seat by the side of the sailor and he gradually got into conversation with him marco introduced the conversation by asking the sailor if he knew how far it was to montpelier no said the sailor i don t keep any reckoning but i wish we were there why asked marco o i expect the old cart will capsize somewhere among these mountains and break our necks for us marco had observed all the morning that when the coach canted to one side or the other on account of the unevenness of the road the sailor always started and looked anxious as if afraid it was going to be upset he wondered that a man who had been apparently accustomed to the terrible dangers of the seas should be alarmed at the gentle oscillations of a stage coach are you afraid that we shall upset asked marco yes said the sailor over some of these precipices and mountains and then there ll be an end of us the sailor said this in an easy and careless manner as if after all he was not much concerned about the danger still marco was surprised that he should fear it at all he was not aware how much the fears which people feel are occasioned by the mere novelty of the danger which they incur a stage driver who is calm and composed on his box in a dark night and upon dangerous roads will be alarmed by the careening of a ship under a gentle breeze at sea while the sailor who laughs at a gale of

the winter to avoid the cold weather which prevails at that time of the year in all the more northerly countries of europe there is so little winter in florence that few of the houses have any fireplaces in them except in the kitchen when there comes a cold day the people warm themselves by means of a jug or jar of earthen ware with a handle passing over across the top by which they carry it about they fill these jars half full of hot embers and so carry them with them wherever they want to go the women when they sit down put the jar under their dresses on the floor or pavement beneath them and the men place it right before them between their feet you will see market women and flower girls sitting in the corners of the streets in the winter attending to their business and keeping themselves warm all the time with these little fire jars and artists in the palaces and picture galleries each with one of them by his side or close before him while he is at work copying the works of the great masters or making drawings from the antique statues there is another very curious use that the people of florence make of these jars and that is they warm the beds with them when any body is sick so as to require this indulgence you would think it very difficult to warm a bed with an open jar filled with burning embers the way they do it is this they hang the jar in the inside of a sort of wooden cage shaped like a bushel basket and about as large they turn this cage upside down and hang the jar up in it by means of a hook depending inside they turn down the bed clothes and put the cage in it jar of coals and all they then put back the bed clothes and cover the cage all up they leave it so for a quarter of an hour and then carefully turning the clothes down again they take the jar out and the bed is warmed but to return to mr george and rollo they engaged a vetturino for the first time at florence mr george had gone to florence chiefly for the purpose of examining the immense collections of paintings and statuary which exist there rollo went not on account of the paintings or statues for he did not care much about such things but because he liked to go any where where he could see new places and be entertained by new scenes accordingly while mr george was at work in the galleries of florence studying by the help of catalogues the famous specimens of ancient art rollo was usually rambling about the streets observing the manners and customs of the people and watching the singular and curious scenes that every where met his eye the reason why there are so many paintings and sculptures in italy is this in the middle ages it was the fashion in all the central parts of europe for the people to spend almost all their surplus money in building and decorating churches indeed there was then very little else that they could do at the present time people invest their funds as fast as they accumulate them in building ships and railroads docks for the storage of merchandise houses and stores in cities to let for the sake of the rent and country seats or pretty private residences of various kinds for themselves but in the middle ages very little could be done in the way of investments like these there were no railroads and there was very little use for ships there was no profit to be gained by building houses and stores for there were so many wars and commotions among the people of the different towns and kingdoms that nothing was stable or safe for the same reason it was useless for men to spend their money in building and ornamenting their own houses for at the first approach of an enemy the town in which they lived was likely to be sacked and their houses and all the fine furniture which they might contain would be burned or destroyed but the churches were safe the people of the different countries had so much veneration for sacred places and for every thing connected with religion that they were afraid to touch or injure any thing that had been consecrated to a religious use to plunder a church or a convent or an abbey or to do any thing to injure or destroy the property that they contained was regarded as sacrilege and sacrilege they deemed a dreadful crime abhorred by god and man thus while they would burn and destroy hundreds of dwellings without any remorse and turn the wretched inmates out at midnight into the streets to die of exposure terror and despair they would stop at once when they came to the church afraid to harm it in any way or to touch the least thing that it contained accordingly while every thing else in a conquered town was doomed to the most reckless destruction all that was in the church the most delicate paintings and the most costly gold and silver images and utensils were as safe as if they were surrounded by impregnable castle walls of course these notions were very mistaken ones according to the teachings of our lord and saviour jesus christ it must be a greater sin to burn down the cottage of a poor widow and turn her out at midnight into the streets to die than to plunder for gain the richest altar in the world from these and various other similar causes it

forester it is quite difficult to drop the pail in such a manner as to get any water when the vessel is under way i should like to try said marco you can find out whether the water is salt easier than that said forester you can let a twine string down and wet the end that will take up enough for a taste well said marco if i ve got a string long enough so saying he began to feel in his pockets for a string he found a piece of twine which he thought would be long enough but on trial it appeared that it would not reach quite to the water forester then tied it to the end of his cane and allowed marco to take the cane and hold it over the side of the vessel and by this means he succeeded in reaching the water and wetting the end of the string he could after all succeed in wetting only a small part of the string for it was drawn along so rapidly by the motion of the boat that it skipped upon the surface of the water without sinking in at length however after he had got the end a little wetted he drew it up and put it in his mouth how does it taste said forester the question was hardly necessary for the faces which marco made showed sufficiently plain that the water was bitter and salt yes it is salt said he then suddenly casting his eye upon a long dark looking substance which just then came floating by he called out why forester what is that a log said forester the log was round and straight and the ends were square the log glided rapidly by and soon disappeared it is a pine log said forester there are vast forests of pine trees in this state they cut down the trees and then cut the trunks into pieces of moderate length and draw them on the snow to the rivers then in the spring the waters rise and float the logs down this is one of these logs floating down sometimes the river is quite full of them where do they go asked marco oh men stop them all along the river and put them into booms and then fasten them together in rafts how do they fasten them together asked marco they drive a pin into the middle of each log and then extend a rope along fastening it to each pin in this manner the rope holds the logs together and they form a long raft when they catch the logs in booms they afterwards form them into rafts and so float them down the river to the mills where they are to be sawed can men stand upon the rafts said marco yes replied forester very well they make a floor of boards i suppose said marco no replied forester they stand directly upon the logs i should think the logs would sink under them replied marco or at least roll about they sink a little replied forester just about as much as the bulk of the man who stands upon them i don t know what you mean by that exactly said marco why the rule of floating bodies is this rejoined forester when any substance like a cake of ice or a log of wood or a boat is floating upon the water a part of it being above the water and a part under the water if a man steps upon it he makes it sink enough deeper to submerge a part of the wood or ice as large as he is himself if there is just as much of the wood or ice above the water as is equal to the bulk of the man then the man in stepping upon it will sink it just to the water s edge but perhaps one man would be heavier than another man said marco yes replied forester but then he would be larger and so according to the principle he would make more wood sink before the equilibrium was reached what is equilibrium asked marco equilibrium is an equality between two forces replied forester i don t see what two forces there are said marco there is the weight of the man pressing downwards said forester for one and the buoyant power of the water that is its upward pressure for the other the weight of the man remains constantly the same but the upward pressure of the water increases in proportion as the log sinks into it for the deeper the log sinks into the water the more of it is submerged and it is more acted upon and pressed upward by the water now as one of these forces remains constant and the other increases they must at length come to be equal that is in equilibrium and then the log will not sink any farther that s the philosophy of it marco marco did not reply but sat looking at the barren and rocky shores of the river as the boat glided by them presently another log came into view there said forester look at that log and see whether you think that you could float upon it yes said marco i think i could it depends said forester on the question whether the part of it which is out of water is as big as you are i think it is said marco yes added forester i have no doubt that it is only i should roll off said marco true replied forester but the millmen who work about the logs acquire astonishing dexterity in

have but one thing to say either to obviate or to answer such an objection if it shall be made to me which is that i loved mr dryden i have not touched upon any other public honour or bounty done by you to your country i have industriously declined entering upon a theme of so extensive a nature and of all your numerous and continual largesses to the public i have only singled out this as what most particularly affected me i confess freely to your grace i very much admire all those other donations but i much more love this and i cannot help it if i am naturally more delighted with any thing that is amiable than with any thing that is wonderful whoever shall censure me i dare be confident you my lord will excuse me for any thing that i shall say with due regard to a gentleman for whose person i had as just an affection as i have an admiration of his writings and indeed mr dryden had personal qualities to challenge both love and esteem from all who were truly acquainted with him he was of a nature exceedingly humane and compassionate easily forgiving injuries and capable of a prompt and sincere reconciliation with them who had offended him such a temperament is the only solid foundation of all moral virtues and sociable endowments his friendship where he professed it went much beyond his professions and i have been told of strong and generous instances of it by the persons themselves who received them though his hereditary income was little more than a bare competency as his reading had been very extensive so was he very happy in a memory tenacious of every thing that he had read he was not more possessed of knowledge than he was communicative of it but then his communication of it was by no means pedantic or imposed upon the conversation but just such and went so far as by the natural turns of the discourse in which he was engaged it was necessarily promoted or required he was extreme ready and gentle in his correction of the errors of any writer who thought fit to consult him and full as ready and patient to admit of the reprehension of others in respect of his own oversight or mistakes he was of very easy i may say of very pleasing access but something slow and as it were diffident in his advances to others he had something in his nature that abhorred intrusion into any society whatsoever indeed it is to be regretted that he was rather blameable in the other extreme for by that means he was personally less known and consequently his character might become liable both to misapprehensions and misrepresentations to the best of my knowledge and observation he was of all the men that ever i knew one of the most modest and the most easily to be discountenanced in his approaches either to his superiors or his equals i have given your grace this slight sketch of his personal character as well to vindicate his memory as to justify myself for the love which i bore to his person and i have the rather done it because i hope it may be acceptable to you to know that he was worthy of the distinction you have shewn him as a man as well as an author as to his writings i shall not take upon me to speak of them for to say little of them would not

distinguished nobles generals and statesmen of the english monarchy known through all the world as westminster abbey after a time when england became at length one kingdom the king built his palace and established his parliament and opened his court in westminster not far from the abbey the place being about three miles from the city was very convenient for this purpose in process of time public edifices were erected and noblemen s houses and new palaces for the king or for other members of the royal family were built and shops were set up for the sale of such things as the people of the court might wish to buy and streets and squares were laid out and in fine westminster became gradually quite an extended and famous town it was still however entirely distinct from london being about three miles from it farther up the river the principal road from london to westminster followed the margin of the water and was called the strand towards westminster the road diverged from the river so as to leave a space between wide enough for houses and along this space the great nobles from time to time built magnificent palaces around great square courts where they could ride in under an archway the fronts of these palaces were towards the road and there were gardens behind them leading down to the water at the foot of the garden there was usually a boat house and a landing where the people who lived in the palace or their friends could embark on board boats for excursions on the thames in the mean time while westminster was thus becoming a large and important town london itself three miles farther down the river was also constantly growing too in its own way as a town of merchants and artisans other villages too began to spring up in every direction around these great centres and london and westminster gradually spreading finally met each other and then extending on each side gradually swallowed up these villages until now the whole region for five or six miles in every direction from the original centres forms one mighty mass of streets squares lanes courts terraces all crowded with edifices and thronged with population in this mass all visible distinction between the several villages which have been swallowed up is entirely lost though the two original centres remain as widely separated and as distinct as ever the primeval london has however lost its exclusive right to its name and is now simply called the city and in the same manner westminster is called the west end and sometimes the town while the name london is used to denote the whole of the vast conglomeration which envelops and includes the two original capitals the city and the west end though thus swallowed as it were in the general metropolis are still entirely distinct they are in fact in some respects even more widely distinct from each other now than ever each is in its own way at the head of its class of cities the city is the greatest and wealthiest mart of commerce in the world while the west end is the seat and centre of the proudest and most extended political and military power in fact the commercial organization which centres in the city and the military one which has its head quarters around the throne at the west end are probably the greatest and most powerful organizations each of its kind that the world has ever known mr george explained all this to rollo as they walked together away from the london bridge station where the train in which they came in from the south stopped when it reached london but i will give a more detailed account of their conversation in the next chapter chapter ii london bridge when the train stopped at what is called the london bridge station the passengers all stepped out of their respective cars upon the platform in the english cars the doors are at the sides and not as in america at the ends so that the passengers get out nearly all at once and the platform becomes immediately crowded beyond the platform on the other side there is usually when a train comes in a long row of cabs and carriages drawn up ready to take the passengers from the several cars so that the traveller has generally nothing to do but to step across the platform from the car that he came in to the cab that is waiting there to receive him nor is there as is usual in america any difficulty or delay in regard to the baggage for each man s trunks are placed on the car that he rides in directly over his head so that while he walks across the platform to the cab the railway porter takes his trunk across and places it on the top of the cab and thus he is off from the station in his cab within two minutes sometimes after he arrived at it in the car the railway porters who attend to the business of transferring the passengers thus from the railway carriages to those of the street are very numerous all along the platform and they are very civil and attentive to the passengers especially to those who come in the first class cars and more especially still according to my observation and experience if the traveller has an agreeable looking lady under his charge the porters are dressed in a sort of uniform by which they are readily distinguished from the crowd they are strictly forbidden to receive any fee or gratuity from the passengers this prohibition however does not prevent their taking very thankfully the shillings or sixpences a that are often offered them particularly by americans who being strangers in the country and not understanding the customs very well think that they require a little more attention than others and so are willing to pay a little extra fee it is however contrary to the rules of the station for the porters to receive any thing and if they take it at all they try to do it as secretly as

sometimes imagine that i descry a faint reflection of him in john browdie in reference to these gentry i may here quote a few words from the original preface to this book it has afforded the author great amusement and satisfaction during the progress of this work to learn from country friends and from a variety of ludicrous statements concerning himself in provincial newspapers that more than one yorkshire schoolmaster lays claim to being the original of mr squeers one worthy he has reason to believe has actually consulted authorities learned in the law as to his having good grounds on which to rest an action for libel another has meditated a journey to london for the express purpose of committing an assault and battery on his traducer a third perfectly remembers being waited on last january twelve month by two gentlemen one of whom held him in conversation while the other took his likeness and although mr squeers has but one eye and he has two and the published sketch does not resemble him whoever he may be in any other respect still he and all his friends and neighbours know at once for whom it is meant because the character is so like him while the author cannot but feel the full force of the compliment thus conveyed to him he ventures to suggest that these contentions may arise from the fact that mr squeers is the representative of a class and not of an individual where imposture ignorance and brutal cupidity are the stock in trade of a small body of men and one is described by these characteristics all his fellows will recognise something belonging to themselves and each will have a misgiving that the portrait is his own the author s object in calling public attention to the system would be very imperfectly fulfilled if he did not state now in his own person emphatically and earnestly that mr squeers and his school are faint and feeble pictures of an existing reality purposely subdued and kept down lest they should be deemed impossible that there are upon record trials at law in which damages have been sought as a poor recompense for lasting agonies and disfigurements inflicted upon children by the treatment of the master in these places involving such offensive and foul details of neglect cruelty and disease as no writer of fiction would have the boldness to imagine and that since he has been engaged upon these adventures he has received from private quarters far beyond the reach of suspicion or distrust accounts of atrocities in the perpetration of which upon neglected or repudiated children these schools have been the main instruments very far exceeding any that appear in these pages this comprises all i need say on the subject except that if i had seen occasion i had resolved to reprint a few of these details of legal proceedings from certain old newspapers one other quotation from the same preface may serve to introduce a fact that my readers may think curious to turn to a more pleasant subject it may be right to say that there are two characters in this book which are drawn from life it is remarkable that what we call the world which is so very credulous in what professes to be true is most incredulous in what professes to be imaginary and that while every day in real life it will allow in one man no blemishes and in another no virtues it will seldom admit a very strongly marked character either good or bad in a fictitious narrative to be within the limits of probability but those who take an interest in this tale will be glad to learn that the brothers cheeryble live that their liberal charity their singleness of heart their noble nature and their unbounded benevolence are no creations of the author s brain but are prompting every day and oftenest by stealth some munificent and generous deed in that town of which they are the pride and honour if i were to attempt to sum up the thousands of letters from all sorts of people in all sorts of latitudes and climates which this unlucky paragraph brought down upon me i should get into an arithmetical difficulty from which i could not easily extricate myself suffice it to say that i believe the applications for loans gifts and offices of profit that i have been requested to forward to the originals of the brothers cheeryble with whom i never interchanged any communication in my life would have exhausted the combined patronage of all the lord chancellors since the accession of the house of brunswick and would have broken the rest of the bank of england the brothers are now dead there is only one other point on which i would desire to offer a remark if nicholas be not always found to be blameless or agreeable he is not always intended to appear so he is a young man of an impetuous temper and of little or no experience and i saw no reason why such a hero should be lifted out of nature chapter introduces all the rest there once lived in a sequestered part of the county of devonshire one mr godfrey nickleby a worthy gentleman who taking it into his head rather late in life that he must get married and not being young enough or rich enough to aspire to the hand of a lady of fortune had wedded an old flame out of

purposes of education and pleasure suited with his son herbert fitzgerald neither sir thomas nor sir thomas s house had about them any of those interesting picturesque faults which are so generally attributed to irish landlords and irish castles he was not out of elbows nor was he an absentee castle richmond had no appearance of having been thrown out of its own windows it was a good substantial modern family residence built not more than thirty years since by the late baronet with a lawn sloping down to the river with kitchen gardens and walls for fruit with ample stables and a clock over the entrance to the stable yard it stood in a well timbered park duly stocked with deer and with foxes also which are agricultural animals much more valuable in an irish county than deer so that as

bloodthirsty old earl who caused it to be erected and how the cement was thickened with human blood so goes rumour with the more romantic of the celtic tale bearers it is a huge place huge ungainly and uselessly extensive built at a time when at any rate in ireland men considered neither beauty aptitude nor economy it is three stories high and stands round a quadrangle in which there are two

popular sovereignty was floating about several ages before the author of the nebraska bill was born indeed before columbus set foot on this continent in the year it took form in the noble words which you are all familiar with we hold these truths to be self evident that all men are created equal etc was not this the origin of popular sovereignty as applied to the american people here we are told that governments are instituted among men deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed if that is not popular sovereignty then i have no conception of the meaning of words if judge douglas did not invent this kind of popular sovereignty let us pursue the inquiry and find out what kind he did invent was it the right of emigrants to kansas and nebraska to govern themselves and a lot of niggers too if they wanted them clearly this was no invention of his because general cass put forth the same doctrine in in his so called nicholson letter six years before douglas thought of such a thing then what was it that the little giant invented it never occurred to general cass to call his discovery by the odd name of popular sovereignty he had not the face to say that the right of the people to govern niggers was the right of the people to govern themselves his notions of the fitness of things were not moulded to the brazenness of calling the right to put a hundred niggers through under the lash in nebraska a sacred right of self government and here i submit to you was judge douglas s discovery and the whole of it he discovered that the right to breed and flog negroes

these studies were nearly ended and when according to the ordinary routine he might have become a preacher a change of views induced him to abandon the intended profession this appears to have been about the year or when he was twenty four years of age for some time he seems to have been uncertain as to his future course along with irving he employed himself for a year or two as a teacher in fifeshire but gradually it became clear to him that his true vocation was that of literature accordingly parting from irving about the year the younger scot of annandale deliberately embraced the alternative open to him and became a general man of letters probably few have ever embraced that profession with qualifications so wide or with aims so high and severe apart altogether from his diligence in learning and from the extraordinary amount of acquired knowledge of all kinds which was the fruit of it there had been remarked in him from the first a strong originality of character a noble earnestness and fervor in all that he said or did and a vein of inherent constitutional contempt for the mean and the frivolous inclining him in some degree to a life of isolation and solitude add to this that his acquaintance with german literature in particular had familiarized him with ideas modes of thinking and types of literary character not then generally known in this country and yet in his opinion more deserving of being known than much of a corresponding kind that was occupying and ruling british thought the first period of mr carlyle s literary life may be said to extend from to or from his twenty sixth to his thirty second year it was during this period that he produced besides a translation of legendre s geometry to which he prefixed an essay on proportion his numerous well known translations from german writers and also his life of schiller the latter and a considerable proportion of the former were written by him during the leisure afforded him by an engagement he had formed in as tutor to charles buller whose subsequent brilliant though brief career in the politics of britain gives interest to this connection the first part of the life of schiller appeared originally in the london magazine of which john scott was editor and hazlitt charles lamb allan cunningham de quincey and hood were the best known supporters and the second and third parts were published in the same magazine in in this year appeared also the translation of g the s wilhelm meister which was published by messrs oliver and boyd of edinburgh without the translator s name this translation the first real introduction of g the to the reading world of great britain attracted much notice the translator said a critic in blackwood is we understand a young gentleman in this city who now for the first time appears before the public we congratulate him on his very promising debut and would fain hope to receive a series of really good translations from his hand he has evidently a perfect knowledge of german he already writes english better than is at all common even at this time and we know of no exercise more likely to produce effects of permanent advantage upon a young mind of intellectual ambition the advice here given to mr carlyle by his critic was followed by him in so far that in he published in edinburgh his specimens of german romance in four volumes one of these containing wilhelm meister s wanderjahre as a fresh specimen of g the the others containing tales from jean paul tieck mus us and hoffman meanwhile in mr carlyle had revised and enlarged his life of schiller and given it to the world in a separate form through the press of messrs taylor and hessay the proprietors of the london magazine in the same year quitting his tutorship of charles buller he had married a lady fitted in a pre eminent degree to be the wife of such a man it is interesting to know that mrs carlyle originally miss welch is a lineal descendent of the scottish reformer knox for some time after the marriage mr carlyle continued to reside in edinburgh but before he removed to craigenputtoch a small property in the most solitary part of dumfries shire the second period of mr carlyle s literary life extending from to or from his thirty second to his thirty ninth year was the period of the first decided manifestations of his extraordinary originality as a thinker probably the very seclusion in which he lived helped to develope in stronger proportions his native and peculiar tendencies the following account of his place and mode of life at this time

alluded to none is so universally diffused as the notion that majorities are omnipotent under the impression that the preservation of order will ever require power to be wielded by some party the moral sense of our time feels that such power cannot rightly be conferred on any but the largest moiety of society it interprets literally the saying that the voice of the people is the voice of god and transferring to the one the sacredness attached to the other it concludes that from the will of the people that is of the majority there can be no appeal yet is this belief entirely erroneous suppose for the sake of argument that struck by some malthusian panic a legislature duly representing public opinion were to enact that all children born during the next ten years should be drowned does any one think such an enactment would be warrantable if not there is evidently a limit to the power of a majority suppose again that of two races living together celts and saxons for example the most numerous determined to make the others their slaves would the authority of the greatest number be in such case valid if not there is something to which its authority must be subordinate suppose once more that all men having incomes under a year were to resolve upon reducing every income above that amount to their own standard and appropriating the excess for public purposes could their resolution be justified if not it must be a third time confessed that there is a law to which the popular voice must defer what then is that law if not the law of pure equity the law of equal freedom these restraints which all would put to the will of the majority are exactly the restraints set up by that law we deny the right of a majority to murder to enslave or to rob simply because murder enslaving and robbery are violations of that law violations too gross to be overlooked but if great violations of it are wrong so also are smaller ones if the will of the many cannot supersede the first principle of morality in these cases neither can it in any so that however insignificant the minority and however trifling the proposed trespass against their rights no such trespass is permissible when we have made our constitution purely democratic thinks to himself the earnest reformer we shall have brought government into harmony with absolute justice such a faith though perhaps needful for the age is a very erroneous one by no process can coercion be made equitable the freest form of government is only the least objectionable form the rule of the many by the few we call tyranny the rule of the few by the many is tyranny also only of a less intense kind you shall do as we will and not as you will is in either case the declaration and if the hundred make it to ninety nine instead of the ninety nine to the hundred it is only a fraction less immoral of two such parties whichever fulfils this declaration necessarily breaks the law of equal freedom the only difference being that by the one it is broken in the persons of ninety nine whilst by the other it is broken in the persons of a hundred and the merit of the democratic form of government consists solely in this that it trespasses against the smallest number the very existence of majorities and minorities is indicative of an immoral state the man whose character harmonises with the moral law we found to be one who can obtain complete happiness without diminishing the happiness of his fellows but the enactment of public arrangements by vote implies a society consisting of men otherwise constituted implies that the desires of some cannot be satisfied without sacrificing the desires of others implies that in the pursuit of their happiness the majority inflict a certain amount of un happiness on the minority implies therefore organic immorality thus from another point of view we again perceive that even in its most equitable form it is impossible for government to dissociate itself from evil and further that unless the right to ignore the state is recognised its acts must be essentially criminal that a man is free to abandon the benefits and throw off the burdens of citizenship may indeed be inferred from the admissions of existing authorities and of current opinion unprepared as they probably are for so extreme a doctrine as the one here maintained the radicals of our day yet unwittingly profess their belief in a maxim which obviously embodies this doctrine do we not continually hear them quote blackstone s assertion that no subject of england can be constrained to pay any aids or taxes even for the defence of the realm or the support of government but such as are imposed by his own consent or that of his representative in parliament and what does this mean it means say

even the largest boat and her main mast with its sail was of gigantic proportions she was also full decked and several pieces of heavy ordnance pointed their black muzzles from port holes in her bulwarks no one could have mistaken her character as a vessel of war for besides the guns referred to she had an unusually large crew of bronzed and stalwart men their costume as well as their arms told that these were of eastern origin although there was much variety in detail they all wore the same gold laced jackets the same loose turkish drawers gathered in below the knees and broad silken scarfs round their waists with richly chased silver mounted pistols and yataghans or curved swords some wore the turban others the blue tasselled red fez or tarbouch of tunis while a few contented

may have in view however abstractedly praiseworthy it may be and even granting that his demerit should be gauged by the amount of knowledge which he possesses of what is true and what false the conclusion is inevitable that nothing short of utter ignorance of the precepts of his faith or a p xxi conscientious disbelief in them can fairly relieve the christian who conforms to islamism without a corresponding persuasion of its verity of the deserved odium all honest men attach to apostasy and hypocrisy the reply to this tirade is simply judge not especially when you are ignorant of the case which you are judging perhaps also the writer may ask himself is it right for those to cast stones who dwell in a tenement not devoid of fragility the second attack proceeds from a place whence no man would reasonably have expected it the author of the narrative of a year s journey through central and eastern arabia vol i pp thus expresses his opinions passing oneself off for a wandering darweesh as some european explorers have attempted to do in the east is for more reasons than one a very bad plan it is unnecessary to dilate on that moral aspect of the proceeding which will always first strike unsophisticated minds to feign a religion which the adventurer himself does not believe to perform with scrupulous exactitude as of the highest and holiest import practices which he inwardly ridicules and which he intends on his return to hold up to the ridicule of others to turn for weeks and months together the most sacred and awful bearings of man towards his creator into a deliberate and truthless mummery not to mention other and yet darker touches all this seems hardly compatible with the character of a european gentleman let alone that of a christian this comes admirably a

three times to the bishop and he had sent a man over to hogglestock to get his little bill settled six days running you see he got it at last of course a tradesman must look for his money mamma do you think that mr crawley stole the cheque mary as she asked the question came and stood over her mother looking at her with anxious eyes i would rather give no opinion my dear but you must think something when everybody is talking about it mamma of course my mother thinks he did said john going back to his book it is impossible that she should think otherwise that is not fair john said mrs walker and i won t have you fabricate thoughts for me or put the expression of them into my mouth the whole affair is very painful and as your father is engaged in the inquiry i think that the less said about the matter in this house the better i am sure that that would be your father s feeling of course i should say nothing about it before him said mary i know that papa does not wish to have it talked about but how is one to help thinking about such a thing it would be so terrible for all of us who belong to the church i do not see that at all said john mr crawley is not more than any other man just because he s a clergyman i hate all that kind of clap trap there are a lot of people here in silverbridge who think the matter shouldn t be followed up just because the man is in a position which makes the crime more criminal in him than it would be in another but i feel sure that mr crawley has committed no crime at all said mary my dear said mrs walker i have just said that i would rather you would not talk about it papa will be in directly i won t mamma only only yes just only said john she d go on till dinner if any one would stay to hear her you ve said twice as much as i have john but john had left the room before his sister s last words could reach him you know mamma it is quite impossible not to help thinking of it said mary i dare say it is my dear and when one knows the people it does make it so dreadful but do you know them i never spoke to mr crawley in my life and i do not think i ever saw her i knew grace very well when she used to come first to miss prettyman s school poor girl i pity her pity her pity is no word for it mamma my heart bleeds for them and yet i do not believe for a moment that he stole the cheque how can it be possible for though he may have been in debt because they have been so very very poor yet we all know that he has been an excellent clergyman when the robartses were dining here last i heard mrs robarts say that for piety and devotion to his duties she had hardly ever seen any one equal to him and the robartses know more of them than anybody they say that the dean is his great friend what a pity it is that the arabins should be away just now when he is in such trouble and in this way the mother and daughter went on discussing the question of the clergyman s guilt in spite of mrs walker s previously expressed desire that nothing more might be said about it but mrs walker like many other mothers was apt to be more free in converse with her daughter than she was with her son while they were thus talking the father came in from his office and then the subject was dropped he was a man between fifty and sixty years of age with grey hair rather short and somewhat corpulent but still gifted with that amount of personal comeliness which comfortable position and the respect of others will generally seem to give a man rarely carries himself meanly whom the world holds high in esteem i am very tired my dear said mr walker you look tired come and sit down for a few minutes before you dress mary get your father s slippers mary instantly ran to the door thanks my darling said the father and then he whispered to his wife as soon as mary was out of hearing i fear that unfortunate man is guilty i fear he is i f\", \"target\": 2, \"compound\": -0.2375, \"neg\": 0.1, \"neu\": 0.8, \"pos\":

begin in what may be called with that licence which is implied in the often used term prehistoric epoch pre geologic time the views indicated in fact are not only quite consistent with the hypothesis that in the still earlier period referred to the condition of our world was very different but they may be held by some to necessitate that hypothesis the physical philosopher who is accurately acquainted with the velocity of a cannon ball and the precise character of the line which it traverses for a yard of its course is necessitated by what he knows of the laws of nature to conclude that it came from a certain spot whence it was impelled by a certain force and that it has followed a certain trajectory in like manner the student of physical geology who fully believes in the uniformity of the general condition of the earth through geologic time may feel compelled by what he knows of causation and by the general analogy of nature to suppose that our solar system was once a nebulous mass that it gradually condensed that it broke up into that wonderful group of harmoniously rolling balls we call planets and satellites and that then each of these underwent its appointed metamorphosis until at last our own share of the cosmic vapour passed into that condition in which we first meet with definite records of its state and in which it has since with comparatively little change remained the doctrine of uniformity and the doctrine of progression are therefore perfectly consistent perhaps indeed they might be shown to be necessarily connected with one another if however the condition of the world which has obtained throughout geologic time is but the sequel to a vast series of changes which took place in pre geologic time then it seems not unlikely that the duration of this latter is to that of the former as the vast extent of geologic time is to the length of the brief epoch we call the historical period and that even the oldest rocks are records of an epoch almost infinitely remote from that which could have witnessed the first shaping of our globe it is probable that no modern geologist would hesitate to admit the general validity of these reasonings when applied to the physics of his subject whence it is the more remarkable that the moment the question changes from one of physics and chemistry to one of natural history scientific opinions and the popular prejudices which reflect them in a distorted form undergo a sudden metamorphosis geologists and palaeontologists write about the beginning of life and the first created forms of living beings as if they were the most familiar things in the world and even cautious writers seem to be on quite friendly terms with the archetype whereby the creator was guided amidst the crash of falling worlds just as it used to be imagined that the ancient world was physically opposed to the present so it is still widely assumed that the living population of our globe whether animal or vegetable in the older epochs exhibited forms so strikingly contrasted with those which we see around us that there is hardly anything in common between the two it is constantly tacitly assumed that we have before us all the forms of life which have ever existed and though the progress of knowledge yearly and almost monthly drives the defenders of that position from their ground they entrench themselves in the new line of defences as if nothing had happened and proclaim that the new beginning is the real beginning without for an instant denying or endeavouring to soften down the considerable positive differences the negative ones are met by another line of argument which undoubtedly obtain between the ancient and the modern worlds of life we believe they have been vastly overstated and exaggerated and this belief is based upon certain facts whose value does not seem to have been fully appreciated though they have long been more or less completely known the multitudinous kinds of animals and plants both recent and fossil are as is well known arranged by zoologists and botanists in accordance with their natural relations into groups which receive the names of sub kingdoms classes orders families genera and species now it is a most remarkable circumstance that viewed on the great scale living beings have differed so little throughout all geologic time that there is no sub kingdom and no class wholly extinct or without living representatives if we descend to the smaller groups we find that the number of orders of plants is about two hundred and i have it on the best authority that not one of these is exclusively fossil so that there is absolutely not a single extinct ordinal type of vegetable life and it is not until we descend to the next group or the families that we find types which are wholly extinct the number of orders of animals on the other hand may be reckoned at a hundred and twenty or thereabouts and of these eight or nine have no living representatives the proportion of extinct ordinal types of animals to the existing types therefore does not exceed seven per cent a marvellously small proportion when we consider the vastness of geologic time another class of considerations of a different kind it is true but tending in the same direction seems to have been overlooked not only is it true that the general plan of construction of animals and plants has been the same in all recorded time as at present but there are particular kinds of animals and plants which have existed throughout vast epochs sometimes through the whole range of recorded time with very little change by reason of this persistency the typical form of such a kind might be called a persistent type in contradistinction to those types which have appeared for but a short time in

are not the best men in the island to be found there as the best men in england are to be found in the british house of commons a pack indeed my father was proud of a seat in that house and i remember the day maurice cumming when your father also thought it no shame to represent his own parish if men like you who have a stake in the country will not go there of course the house is filled with men who have no stake if they are a pack it is you who send them there you and others like you all had its effect though at the moment maurice would shrug his shoulders and turn away his head from the torrent of the lady s discourse but miss jack though she was not greatly liked was greatly respected maurice would not own that she convinced him but at last he did allow his name to be put up as candidate for his own parish and in due time he became a member of the honourable house of assembly in jamaica this honour entails on the holder of it the necessity of living at or within reach of spanish town for some ten weeks towards the chose of every year now on the whole face of the uninhabited globe there is perhaps no spot more dull to look at more lethean in its aspect more corpse like or more cadaverous than spanish town it is the head quarters of the government the seat of the legislature the residence of the governor but nevertheless it is as it were a city of the very dead here as we have said before lived miss jack in a large forlorn ghost like house in which her father and all her family had lived before her and as a matter of course maurice cumming when he came up to attend to his duties as a member of the legislature took up his abode with her now at the time of which we are specially speaking he had completed the first of these annual visits he had already benefited his country by sitting out one session of the colonial parliament and had satisfied himself that he did no other good than that of keeping away some person more objectionable than himself he was however prepared to repeat this self sacrifice in a spirit of patriotism for which he received a very meagre meed of eulogy from miss jack and an amount of self applause which was not much more extensive down at mount pleasant i can do something he would say over and over again but what good can any man do up here you can do your duty miss jack would answer as others did before you when the colony was made to prosper and then they would run off into a long discussion about free labour and protective duties but at the present moment maurice cumming had another vexation on his mind over and above that arising from his wasted hours at spanish town and his fruitless labours at mount pleasant he was in love and was not altogether satisfied with the conduct of his lady love miss jack had other nephews besides maurice cumming and nieces also of whom marian leslie was one\", \"target\": 2, \"compound\": 0.9972, \"neg\": 0.093, \"neu\": 0.768, \"pos\": 0.139}, {\"date\": 1858, \"info\":

steamboats said waldron do they build a great many steamboats in greenock and glasgow asked rollo yes said waldron this is the greatest place for building steamboats in the world except new york said rollo o of course except new york replied waldron but they build all the big english steamers in this river all the cunarders were built here and they have got some of the best machine shops and founderies here that there are in the world i should like to go all about and see them if i could only get away from my mother why won t she let you go said rollo no replied waldron not if she knows it she thinks i am a little boy and is so afraid that i shall get hurt waldron pronounced the word hurt in a drawling and contemptuous tone which was so comical that rollo could not help laughing outright i go to all the ship yards and founderies in new york whenever i please continued waldron i go when she does not know it sometimes the men let me help them carry out the melted iron and pour it into the moulds by this time the two boys had reached the place where mr george was he was sitting on what is called a camp stool and was engaged in reading his guide book and studying the map with a view of finding out what route it would be best to take in the tour they were about making in scotland mr george drew the boys into conversation with him on the subject his object was to become acquainted with waldron and find out what sort of a boy he was where do you wish to go waldron said mr george why i want to stay here a good many days said waldron to see the steamers and the dockyards they are building a monstrous iron ship somewhere here she is going to be five hundred tons bigger than the baltic i should like to see her said mr george as he said this he kept his eye upon his map following his finger as he moved it about from place to place as if he was studying out a good way to go there is edinburgh said mr george we must certainly go to edinburgh yes said waldron i suppose that is a pretty great place besides i want to see the houses twelve stories high and there is linlithgow continued mr george still looking upon his map that is the place where mary queen of scots was born waldron would you like to go there why no said waldron doubtfully not much i don t care much about that it is a famous old ruin said mr george but i don t care much about the old ruins said waldron if the lords and noblemen are as rich as people say they are i should think they would mend them up and here off in the western part of scotland continued mr george are a great many mountains would you like to go and see the mountains no sir said waldron not particularly then in a moment he added can we go up to the top of them mr george yes said mr george we can go to the top of some of them the highest asked waldron yes said mr george ben nevis i believe is the highest we can go to the top of that then i should like to go said waldron eagerly unless continued mr george it should rain too hard o i should not care for the rain said waldron it s good fun to go in the rain while this conversation had been going on waldron had been looking this way and that at the various ships and steamers that were gliding about on the water examining carefully the building of each one and watching her motions he now proposed that rollo should go forward to the bridge with him where they could have a better lookout well said rollo so the two boys went together to the bridge the bridge was a sort of narrow platform extending across the steamer from one paddle wheel to the other for the captain or pilot to walk upon in order to see how the steamer was going and to direct the steering when they are in the open sea any of the passengers are allowed to walk here but in coming into port or into a river crowded with shipping then a notice is put up requesting passengers not to go upon the bridge inasmuch as at such times it is required for the exclusive use of the captain and pilot this notice was up when waldron and rollo reached the bridge see said rollo pointing at the notice we cannot go there o never mind that said waldron they ll let us go they only mean that they don t want too many there that s all but rollo would not go mr george had accustomed him in travelling about the world always to obey all lawful rules and orders and particularly every direction of this kind which he might find in public places some people are very much inclined to crowd upon the line of such rules and even to encroach upon them till they actually encounter some resistance to drive them back they do this partly to show their independence and importance but mr george was not one of this sort so rollo would not go upon the bridge then let us go out on the forecastle said waldron he pointed as he spoke to the forecastle which is a small raised deck at the bows of a steamer where there is an excellent place to see no said rollo i will not go on the

is it not true that london is choked by its own fatness not having been endowed at its birth or during its growth with proper means for accommodating its own increasing proportions was it not well to lay down fine avenues and broad streets so that future citizens might find a city well prepared to their hand there is no doubt much in such an argument but its correctness must be tested by its success when a man marries it is well that be should make provision for a coming family but a benedict who early in his career shall have carried his friends with considerable self applause through half a dozen nurseries and at the end of twelve years shall still be the father of one rickety baby will incur a certain amount of ridicule it is very well to be prepared for good fortune but one should limit one s preparation within a reasonable scope two miles by one might perhaps have done for the skeleton sketch of a new city less than half that would contain much more than the present population of washington and there are i fear few towns in the union so little likely to enjoy any speedy increase three avenues sweep the whole length of washington virginia avenue pennsylvania avenue and massachusetts avenue but pennsylvania avenue is the only one known to ordinary men and the half of that only is so known this avenue is the backbone of the city and those streets which are really inhabited cluster round that half of it which runs westward from the capitol the eastern end running from the front of the capitol is again a desert the plan of the city is somewhat complicated it may truly be called a mighty maze but not without a plan the capitol was intended to be the center of the city it faces eastward away from the potomac or rather from the main branch of the potomac and also unfortunately from the main body of the town it turns its back upon the chief thoroughfare upon the treasury buildings and upon the president s house and indeed upon the whole place it was i suppose intended that the streets to the eastward should be noble and populous but hitherto they have come to nothing the building therefore is wrong side foremost and all mankind who enter it senators representatives and judges included go in at the back door of course it is generally known that in the capitol is the chamber of the senate that of the house of representatives and the supreme judicial court of the union it may be said that there are two centers in washington this being one and the president s house the other at these centers the main avenues are supposed to cross each other which avenues are called by the names of the respective states at the capitol pennsylvania avenue new jersey avenue delaware avenue and maryland avenue converge they come from one extremity of the city to the square of the capitol on one side and run out from the other side of it to the other extremity of the city pennsylvania avenue new york avenue vermont avenue and connecticut avenue do the same at what is generally called president s square in theory or on paper this seems to be a clear and intelligible arrangement but it does not work well these center depots are large spaces and consequently one portion of a street is removed a considerable distance from the other it is as though the same name should be given to two streets one of which entered st james s park at buckingham gate while the other started from the park at marlborough house to inhabitants the matter probably is not of much moment as it is well known that this portion of such an avenue and that portion of such another avenue are merely myths unknown lands away in the wilds but a stranger finds himself in the position of being sent across the country knee deep into the mud wading through snipe grounds looking for civilization where none exists all these avenues have a slanting direction they are so arranged that none of them run north and south or east and west but the streets so called all run in accordance with the points of the compass those from east to west are a street b street c street and so on counting them away from the capitol on each side so that there are two a streets and two b streets on the map these streets run up to v street both right and left v street north and v street south those really known to mankind are e f g h i and k streets north then those streets which run from north to south are numbered first street second street third street and so on on each front of the capitol running to twenty fourth or twenty fifth street on each side not very many of these have any existence or i might perhaps more properly say any vitality in their existence such is the plan of the city that being the arrangement and those the dimensions intended by the original architects and founders of washington but the inhabitants have hitherto confined themselves to pennsylvania avenue west and to the streets abutting from it or near to it whatever address a stranger may receive however perplexing it may seem to him he may be sure that the house indicated is near pennsylvania avenue if it be not i should recommend him to pay no attention to the summons even in those streets with which he will become best acquainted the houses are not continuous there will be a house and then a blank then two houses and then a double blank after that a hut or two and then probably an excellent roomy handsome family mansion taken altogether washington as a city is most unsatisfactory and falls more grievously short of the thing attempted than any other of the great

up as a means to such ends and was grounded on experience of the mode in which they could be most effectually attained if the authority of men over women when first established had been the result of a conscientious comparison between different modes of constituting the government of society if after trying various other modes of social organization the government of women over men equality between the two and such mixed and divided modes of government as might be invented it had been decided on the testimony of experience that the mode in which women are wholly under the rule of men

the happiness and well being of both its general adoption might then be fairly thought to be some evidence that at the time when it was adopted if was the best though even then the considerations which recommended it may like so many other primeval social facts of the greatest importance have subsequently in the course of ages ceased to exist but the state of the case is in every respect the reverse of this in the first place the opinion in favour of the present system which entirely subordinates the weaker sex to the stronger rests upon theory only for there never has been trial made of any other so that experience in the sense in which it is vulgarly opposed to theory cannot be pretended to have pronounced any verdict and in the second place the adoption of this system of inequality never was the result of deliberation or forethought or any social ideas or any notion whatever of what conduced to the benefit of humanity or the good order of society it arose simply from the fact that from the very earliest twilight of human society every woman owing to the value attached to her by men combined with her inferiority in muscular strength was found in a state of bondage to some man laws and systems of polity always begin by recognising the relations they find already existing between individuals they convert what was a mere physical fact into a legal right give it the sanction of society and principally aim at the substitution of public and organized means of asserting and protecting these rights instead of the irregular and lawless conflict of physical strength

of compact among the masters who binding themselves to one another for common protection guaranteed by their collective strength the private possessions of each including his slaves in early times the

therefore he appeared incomparably strong and eloquence in congress and elsewhere seemed to me at a discount it was like the speeches of cromwell compared with those of an ordinary king as for his tact and prudence i will merely say that at a time when scarcely a man from the free states was able to reach kansas by any direct route at least without having his arms taken from him he carrying what imperfect guns and other weapons he could collect openly and slowly drove an ox cart through missouri apparently in the capacity of a surveyor with his surveying compass exposed in it and so passed unsuspected and had ample opportunity to learn the designs of the enemy for some time after his arrival he still followed the same profession when for instance he saw a knot of the ruffians on the prairie discussing of course the single topic which then occupied their minds he would perhaps take his compass and one of his sons and proceed to run an imaginary line right through the very spot on which that conclave had assembled and when he came up to them he would naturally pause and have some talk with them learning their news and at last all their plans perfectly and having thus completed his real survey he would resume his imaginary one and run on his line till he was out of sight when i expressed surprise that he could live in kansas at all with a price set upon his head and so large a number including the authorities exasperated against him he accounted for it by saying it is perfectly well understood that i will not be taken much of the time for some years he has had to skulk in swamps suffering from poverty and from sickness which was the consequence of exposure befriended only by indians and a few whites but though it might be known that he was lurking in a particular swamp his foes commonly did not care to go in after him he could even come out into a town where there were more border ruffians than free state men and transact some business without delaying long and yet not be molested for said he no little handful of men were willing to undertake it and a large body could not be got together in season as for his recent failure we do not know the facts about it it was evidently far from being a wild and desperate attempt his enemy mr vallandigham is compelled to say that it was among the best planned executed conspiracies that ever failed

what he had done thus convincing missouri that it was not profitable to try to hold slaves in his neighborhood and this not because the government menials were lenient but because they were afraid of him yet he did not attribute his success foolishly to his star or to any magic he said truly that the reason why such greatly superior numbers quailed before him was as one of his prisoners confessed because they lacked a cause a kind of armor which he and his party never lacked when the time came few men were found willing to lay down their lives in defence of what they knew to be wrong they did

fewer minds are naturally inclined to scientific study than to linguistic or historical study so that if some science is to be learnt by everybody the amount of such study should be limited to acquiring in one or two sciences knowledge of the scientific method in general so much scientific training is indeed universally desirable because good training of the senses to observe accurately is universally desirable and the collecting comparing and grouping of many facts teach orderliness in thinking and lead up to something which spencer valued highly in education a rational explanation of phenomena science having obtained a foothold in secondary schools and colleges an adequate development of science teaching resulted from the introduction of options or elections for the pupils among numerous different courses in place of a curriculum prescribed for all the elaborate teaching of many sciences was thus introduced the pupil or student saw and recorded for himself used books only as helps and guides in seeing recording and generalising proceeded from the known to the unknown and in short made numerous applications of the doctrines which pervade all spencer s writings on education in the united states these methods were introduced earlier and have been carried farther than in england but within the last few years the changes made in education have been more extensive and rapid in england than in any other country witness the announcements of the new high schools and the re organised grammar schools of such colleges as south kensington armstrong king s the university college london and goldsmiths and of the new municipal universities such as victoria bristol sheffield birmingham liverpool and leeds the new technical schools also illustrate the advent of instruction in applied science as an important element in advanced education such institutions as the seafield park engineering college the city guilds of london institute the city of london college and the battersea polytechnic are instances of the same development some endowed institutions for girls illustrate the same tendencies as for example the bedford college for women and the royal holloway college all these institutions teach sciences in considerable variety and in the way that spencer advocated not so much because they have distinctly accepted his views as because modern industrial and social conditions compel the preparation in science of young people destined for various occupations and services indispensable to modern society the method of the preparation is essentially that which he advocated spencer s propositions to the effect that the study of science was desirable for artisans artists and in general for people who were to get their livings through various skills of hand and eye were received with great incredulity not to say derision particularly when he maintained that some knowledge of the theory which underlies an art was desirable for manual practitioners of the art but the changes of the last fifty years in the practice of the arts and trades may be said to have demonstrated that his views were thoroughly sound the applications of science in the arts and trades have been so numerous and productive that widespread training in science has become indispensable to any nation which means to excel in the manufacturing industries whether of large scale or small scale the extraordinary popularity of evening schools and correspondence schools in the united states rests on the need which young people employed in the various industries of the country feel of obtaining more theoretical knowledge about the physical or chemical processes through which they are earning a livelihood the young men s christian associations in the american cities have become great centres of evening instruction for just such young persons the correspondence schools are teaching hundreds of thousands of young people at work in machine shops mills mines and factories who believe that they can advance themselves in their several occupations by supplementing their elementary education with correspondence courses taken while they are at work earning a livelihood in industries that rest ultimately on applications of science spencer s objection to the constant exercise of authority and compulsion in schools families and the state is felt to day much more widely than it was in when he wrote his essay on moral education his proposal that children should be allowed to suffer the natural consequences of their foolish or wrong acts does not seem to the present generation any more than it did to him to be applicable to very young children who need protection from the undue severity of many natural penalties but the soundness of his general doctrine that it is the true function of parents and teachers to see that children habitually experience the normal consequences of their conduct without putting artificial consequences in place of them now commands the assent of most persons whose minds have been freed from the theological dogmas of original sin and total depravity spencer did not expect the immediate adoption of this principle because society as a whole was not yet humane enough he admitted that the uncontrollable child of ill controlled adults might sometimes have to be scolded or beaten and that these barbarous methods might be perhaps the best preparation such children can have for the barbarous society in which they are presently to play a part he hoped however that the civilised members of society would by and by spontaneously use milder measures and this hope has been realised in good degree with the result that happiness in childhood is much commoner and more constant than it used to be parents and teachers are beginning

enough to overlook them you see nothing all the way in these places but a low green bank on each side of the river with a fringe of trees and shrubbery along the margin of it for about one hundred miles of its course however near the central portion of it the river flows through a very wild and mountainous district of country or rather through a district which was once wild though now even in the steepest slopes and declivities it is cultivated like a garden the reason why these mountainous regions are so highly cultivated is because the soil and climate are such that they produce the best and most delicious grapes in the world they have consequently from time immemorial been inhabited by a dense population every foot of ground where there is room for a vine to grow is valuable and where the slope was originally steep and rocky the peasants of former ages have gathered out the rocks and stones and built walls of them to terrace up the land the villages of these peasants too are

might see better he had changed his place and taken a seat on the banquette the banquette is a seat on the top of the coach and though it is covered above it is open in front and so it affords an excellent view mr george remained in the coup being very much interested in reading his guide book footnote the stage coaches on the continent of europe are called diligences at length rollo called out to tell his uncle that the city was in view the windows of the coup were open so that by leaning over and looking down he could speak to his uncle without any difficulty mr george was so busy reading his guide book that he paid little attention to what rollo said uncle george said rollo calling louder i can see the city and in the midst of it is a church with a great square tower and something very singular on the top of it mr george still continued his reading there is a spire on the top of the church continued rollo but it is bent down on one side entirely as if it had half

at length to these importunities and looked out the country around in every direction was one vast plain covered with fields of grain luxuriant and beautiful beyond description it was without any fences or other divisions except such as were produced by different kinds of cultivation so that the view extended interminably in almost every direction there were rows and copses of trees here and there giving variety and life to the view and from among them were sometimes to be seen the spires of distant villages in the distance too in the direction in which rollo pointed lay the town of

legislation as will insure a gradual return to specie payments and put an immediate stop to fluctuations in the value of currency the methods to secure the former of these results are as numerous as are the speculators on political economy to secure the latter i see but one way and that is to authorize the treasury to redeem its own paper at a fixed price whenever presented and to withhold from circulation all currency so redeemed until sold again for gold the vast resources of the nation both developed and undeveloped ought to make our credit the best on earth with a less burden of taxation than the citizen has endured for six years past the entire public debt could be paid in ten years but it is not desirable that the people should be taxed to pay it in that time year by year the ability to pay increases in a rapid ratio but the burden of interest ought to be reduced as rapidly as can be done without the violation of contract the public debt is represented in great part by bonds having from five to twenty and from ten to forty years to run bearing interest at the rate of per cent and per cent respectively it is optional with the government to pay these bonds at any period after the expiration of the least time mentioned upon their face the time has already expired when a great part of them may be taken up and is rapidly approaching when all may be it is believed that all which are now due may be replaced by bonds bearing a rate of interest not exceeding per cent and as rapidly as the remainder become due that they may be replaced in the same way to accomplish this it may be necessary to authorize the interest to be paid at either of three or four of the money centers of europe or by any assistant treasurer of the united states at the option of the holder of the bond i suggest this subject for the consideration of congress and also simultaneously with this the propriety of redeeming our currency as before suggested at its market value at the time the law goes into effect increasing the rate at which currency shall be bought and sold from day to day or week to week at the same rate of interest as government pays upon its bonds the subjects of tariff and internal taxation will necessarily receive your attention the revenues of the country are greater than the requirements and may with safety be reduced but as the funding of the debt in a or a per cent loan would reduce annual current expenses largely thus after funding justifying a greater reduction of taxation than would be now expedient i suggest postponement of this question until the next meeting of congress it may be advisable to modify taxation and tariff in instances where unjust or burdensome discriminations are made by the present laws but a general revision of the laws regulating this subject i recommend the postponement of for the present i also suggest the renewal of the tax on incomes but at a reduced rate say of per cent and this tax to expire in three years with the funding of the national debt as here suggested i feel safe in saying that taxes and the revenue from imports may be reduced safely from sixty to eighty millions per annum at once and may be still further reduced from year to year as the resources of the country are developed the report of the secretary of the treasury shows the receipts of the government for the fiscal year ending june to be and the expenditures including interest bounties etc to be the estimates for the ensuing year are more favorable to the government and will no doubt show a much larger decrease of the public debt the receipts in the treasury beyond expenditures have exceeded the amount necessary to place to the credit of the sinking fund as provided by law to lock up the surplus in the treasury and withhold it from circulation would lead to such a contraction of the currency as to cripple trade and seriously affect the prosperity of the country under these circumstances the secretary of the treasury and myself heartily concurred in the propriety of using all the surplus currency in the treasury in the purchase of government bonds thus reducing the interest bearing indebtedness of the country and of submitting to congress the question of the disposition to be made of the bonds so purchased the bonds now held by the treasury amount to about seventy five millions including those belonging to the sinking fund i recommend that the whole be placed to the credit of the sinking fund your attention is respectfully invited to the recommendations of the secretary of the treasury for

extent of coast and every wave loaded as it is with particles of sand and gravel as it breaks upon the shore does something towards the disintegrating process and thus slowly but surely the hardest rocks are gradually ground down to a powdery substance and the mud thus formed coarser or finer as the case may be is carried by the rush of the tides or currents till it reaches the comparatively deeper parts of the ocean in which it can sink to the bottom that is to parts where there is a depth of about fourteen or fifteen fathoms a depth at which the water is usually nearly motionless and in which of course the finer particles of this detritus or mud as we call it sinks to the bottom or again if you take a river rushing down from its mountain sources brawling over the stones and rocks that intersect its path loosening removing and carrying with it in its downward course the pebbles and lighter matters from its banks it crushes and pounds down the rocks and earths in precisely the same way as the wearing action of the sea waves the matters forming the deposit are torn from the mountain side and whirled impetuously into the valley more slowly over the plain thence into the estuary and from the estuary they are swept into the sea the coarser and heavier fragments are obviously deposited first that is as soon as the current begins to lose its force by becoming amalgamated with the stiller depths of the ocean but the finer and lighter particles are carried further on and eventually deposited in a deeper and stiller portion of the ocean it clearly follows from this that mud gives us a chronology for it is evident that supposing this which i now sketch to be the sea bottom and supposing this to be a coast line from the washing action of the sea upon the rock wearing and grinding it down into a sediment of mud the mud will be carried down and at length deposited in the deeper parts of this sea bottom where it will form a layer and then while that first layer is hardening other mud which is coming from the same source will of course be carried to the same place and as it is quite impossible for it to get beneath the layer already there it deposits itself above it and forms another layer and in that way you gradually have layers of mud constantly forming and hardening one above the other and conveying a record of time it is a necessary result of the operation of the law of gravitation that the uppermost layer shall be the youngest and the lowest the oldest and that the different beds shall be older at any particular point or spot in exactly the ratio of their depth from the surface so that if they were upheaved afterwards and you had a series of these different layers of mud converted into sandstone or limestone as the case might be you might be sure that the bottom layer was deposited first and that the upper layers were formed afterwards here you see is the first step in the history these layers of mud give us an idea of time the whole surface of the earth i speak broadly and leave out minor qualifications is made up of such layers of mud so hard the majority of them that we call them rock whether limestone or sandstone or other varieties of rock and seeing that every part of the crust of the earth is made up in this way you might think that the determination of the chronology the fixing of the time which it has taken to form this crust is a comparatively simple matter take a broad average ascertain how fast the mud is deposited upon the bottom of the sea or in the estuary of rivers take it to be an inch or two or three inches a year or whatever you may roughly estimate it at then take the total thickness of the whole series of stratified rocks which geologists estimate at twelve or thirteen miles or about seventy thousand feet make a sum in short division divide the total thickness by that of the quantity deposited in one year and the result will of course give you the number of years which the crust has taken to form truly that looks a very simple process it would be so except for certain difficulties the very first of which is that of finding how rapidly sediments are deposited but the main

ear for his youngest daughter was the doctor s pet the doctor certainly did not snub his son for he allowed him to go over to london when he was twenty two years of age in order that he might read with an english barrister it was the doctor s wish that his son might be called to the irish bar and the young man s desire that he might go to the english bar the doctor so far gave way under the influence of phineas himself and of all the young women of the family as to pay the usual fee to a very competent and learned gentleman in the middle temple and to allow his son one hundred and fifty pounds per annum for three years dr finn however was still firm in his intention that his son should settle in dublin and take the munster circuit believing that phineas might come to want home influences and home connections in spite of the swanhood which was attributed to him phineas sat his terms for three years and was duly called to the bar but no evidence came home as to the acquirement of any considerable amount of law lore or even as to much law study on the part of the young aspirant the learned pundit at whose feet he had been sitting was not especially loud in praise of his pupil s industry though he did say a pleasant word or two as to his pupil s intelligence phineas himself did not boast much of his own hard work when at home during the long vacation no rumours of expected successes of expected professional successes reached the ears of any of the finn family at killaloe but nevertheless there came tidings which maintained those high ideas in the maternal bosom of which mention has been made and which were of sufficient strength to induce the doctor in opposition to his own judgment to consent to the continued residence of his son in london phineas belonged to an excellent club the reform club and went into very good society he was hand in glove with the hon laurence fitzgibbon the youngest son of lord claddagh he was intimate with barrington erle who had been private secretary one of the private secretaries to the great whig prime minister who was lately in but was now out he had dined three or four times with that great whig nobleman the earl of brentford and he had been assured that if he stuck to the english bar he would certainly do well though he might fail to succeed in court or in chambers he would doubtless have given to him some one of those numerous appointments for which none but clever young barristers are supposed to be fitting candidates the old doctor yielded for another year although at the end of the second year he was called upon to pay a sum of three hundred pounds which was then due by phineas to creditors in london when the doctor s male friends in and about killaloe heard that he had done so they said that he was doting not one of the miss finns was as yet married and after all that had been said about the doctor s wealth it was supposed that there would not be above five hundred pounds a year among them all were he to give up his profession but the doctor when he paid that three hundred pounds for his son buckled to his work again though he had for twelve months talked of giving up the midwifery he buckled to again to the great disgust of dr duggin who at this time said very ill natured things about young phineas at the end of the three years phineas was called to the bar and immediately received a letter from his father asking minutely as to his professional intentions his father recommended him to settle in dublin and promised the one hundred and fifty pounds for three more years on condition that this advice was followed he did not absolutely say that the allowance would be stopped if the advice were not followed but that was plainly to be implied that letter came at the moment of a dissolution of parliament lord de terrier the conservative prime minister who had now been in office for the almost unprecedentedly long period of fifteen months had found that he could not face continued majorities against him in the house of commons and had dissolved the house rumour declared that he would have much preferred to resign and betake himself once again to the easy glories of opposition but his party had naturally been obdurate with him and he had resolved to appeal to the country when phineas received his father s letter it had just been suggested to him at the reform club that he should stand for the irish borough of loughshane this proposition had taken phineas finn so much by surprise that when first made to him by barrington erle it took his breath away what he stand for parliament twenty four years old with no vestige of property belonging to him without a penny in his purse as completely dependent on his father as he was when he first went to school at eleven years of age and for loughshane a little borough in the county galway for which a brother of that fine old irish peer the earl of tulla had been sitting for the last twenty years a fine high minded representative of the thorough going orange protestant feeling of ireland and the earl of tulla to whom almost all loughshane belonged or at any rate the land about loughshane was one of his father s staunchest friends loughshane is in county galway but the earl of tulla usually lived at his seat in county clare not more than ten miles from killaloe and always confided his

was this when our frigate lay in callao on the coast of peru her last harbour in the pacific i found myself without a grego or sailor s surtout and as toward the end of a three years cruise no pea jackets could be had from the purser s steward and being bound for cape horn some sort of a substitute was indispensable i employed myself for several days in manufacturing an outlandish garment of my own devising to shelter me from the boisterous weather we were so soon to encounter it was nothing more than a white duck frock or rather shirt which laying on deck i folded double at the bosom and by then making a continuation of the slit there opened it lengthwise much as you would cut a leaf in the last new novel the gash being made a metamorphosis took place transcending any related by ovid for presto the shirt was a coat a strange looking coat to be sure of a quakerish amplitude about the skirts with an infirm tumble down collar and a clumsy fullness about the wristbands and white yea white as a shroud and my shroud it afterward came very near proving as he who reads further will find but bless me my friend what sort of a summer jacket is this in which to weather cape horn a very tasty and beautiful white linen garment it may have seemed but then people almost universally sport their linen next to their skin very true and that thought very early occurred to me for no idea had i of scudding round cape horn in my shirt for that would have been almost scudding under bare poles indeed so with many odds and ends of patches old socks old trowser legs and the like i bedarned and bequilted the inside of my jacket till it became all over stiff and padded as king james s cotton stuffed and dagger proof doublet and no buckram or steel hauberk stood up more stoutly so far very good but pray tell me white jacket how do you propose keeping out the rain and the wet in this quilted grego of yours you don t call this wad of old patches a mackintosh do you you don t pretend to say that worsted is water proof no my dear friend and that was the deuce of it waterproof it was not no more than a sponge indeed with such recklessness had i bequilted my jacket that in a rain storm i became a universal absorber swabbing bone dry the very bulwarks i leaned against of a damp day my heartless shipmates even used to stand up against me so powerful was the capillary attraction between this luckless jacket of mine and all drops of moisture i dripped like a turkey a roasting and long after the rain storms were over and the sun showed his face i still stalked a scotch mist and when it was fair weather with others alas it was foul weather with me me ah me soaked and heavy what a burden was that jacket to carry about especially when i was sent up aloft dragging myself up step by step as if i were weighing the anchor small time then to strip and wring it out in a rain when no hanging back or delay was permitted no no up you go fat or lean lambert or edson never mind how much avoirdupois you might weigh and thus in my own proper person did many showers of rain reascend toward the skies in accordance with the natural laws but here be it known that i had been terribly disappointed in carrying out my original plan concerning this jacket it had been my intention to make it thoroughly impervious by giving it a coating of paint but bitter fate ever overtakes us unfortunates so much paint had been stolen by the sailors in daubing their overhaul trowsers and tarpaulins that by the time i an honest man had completed my quiltings the paint pots were banned and

impression even upon a mind formed and upon principles developed how infinitely more powerful must the influence of such communion be upon a youthful heart ardent innocent and unpractised as vivian

remember there was some difficulty in fixing upon his future academus mr grey s two axioms were first that no one so young as his son should settle in the metropolis and that vivian must consequently not have a private tutor and secondly that all private schools were quite worthless and therefore there was every probability of vivian not receiving any education whatever at length an exception to

our sophisticated senses though i suspect a sailor or shepherd would be their match but i have seen nothing that leads me to believe their minds capable of erecting the horoscope of a whole season and letting us know beforehand whether the winter will be severe or the summer rainless i more than suspect that the clerk of the weather himself does not always know very long in advance whether he is to

breadth which made a fair and princely show somewhat resembling a crown in form about his neck he had a chain of perfect gold the links very great and one fold double on his left hand was a diamond an emerald a ruby and a turky on his right hand in one ring a big and perfect turky and in another ring many diamonds of a smaller size all this glitter of barbaric gold was the produce of the spice trade of which the sultans kept the monopoly and by which they became wealthy ternate with the small islands in a line south of it as far as batchian constitute the ancient moluccas the native country of the clove as well as the only part in which it was cultivated nutmegs and mace were procured from the natives of new guinea and the adjacent islands where they grew wild and the profits on spice cargoes were so enormous that the european traders were glad to give gold and jewels and the finest manufactures of europe or of india in exchange when the dutch established their influence in these seas and relieved the native princes from their portuguese oppressors they saw that the easiest way to repay themselves would be to get this spice trade into their own hands for this purpose they adopted the wise principle of concentrating the culture of these valuable products in those spots only of which they could have complete control to do this effectually it was necessary to abolish the culture and trade in all other places which they succeeded in doing by treaty with the native rulers these agreed to have all the spice trees in their possessions destroyed they gave up large though fluctuating revenues but they gained in return a fixed subsidy freedom from the constant attacks and harsh oppressions of the portuguese and a continuance of their regal power and exclusive authority over their own subjects which is maintained in all the islands except ternate to this day it is no doubt supposed by most englishmen who have been accustomed to look upon this act of the dutch with vague horror as something utterly unprincipled and barbarous that the native population suffered grievously by this destruction of such valuable property but it is certain that this was not the case the sultans kept this lucrative trade entirely in their own hands as a rigid monopoly and they would take care not to give their subjects more than would amount to their usual wages while they would surely exact as large a quantity of spice as they could possibly obtain drake and other early voyagers always seem to have purchased their spice cargoes from the sultans and rajahs and not from the cultivators now the absorption of so much labour in the cultivation of this one product must necessarily have raised the price of food and other necessaries and when it was abolished more rice would be grown more sago made more fish caught and more tortoise shell rattan gum dammer and other valuable products of the seas and the forests would be obtained i believe therefore that this abolition of the spice trade in the moluccas was actually beneficial to the inhabitants and that it was an act both wise in itself and morally and politically justifiable in the selection of the places in which to carry on the cultivation the dutch were not altogether fortunate or wise banda was chosen for nutmegs and was eminently successful since it continues to this day to produce a large supply of this spice and to yield a considerable revenue amboyna was fixed upon for establishing the clove cultivation but the soil and climate although apparently very similar to that of its native islands is not favourable and for some years the government have actually been paying to the cultivators a higher rate than they could purchase cloves elsewhere owing to a great fall in the price since the rate of payment was fixed for a term of years by the dutch government and which rate is still most honourably paid in walking about the suburbs of ternate we find everywhere the ruins of massive stone and

s an earthquake and lay still in the pleasing expectation of another shock but none came and this was the only earthquake i ever felt in ternate the last great one was in february when almost every house in the place was destroyed it began about midnight on the chinese new year s festival at which time every one stays up nearly all night feasting at the chinamen s houses and seeing the processions this prevented any lives being lost as every one ran out of doors at the first shock which was not very severe the second a few minutes afterwards threw down a great many houses and others

time but two rivals in the country neither of them within a considerable distance it became the general resort of the youth of the province in which it was situated for several years in succession its students amounted to nearly fifty a number which relatively to the circumstances of the country was very considerable from the exterior of the collegians an accurate observer might pretty safely judge how long they had been inmates of those classic walls the brown cheeks and the rustic dress of some would inform him that they had but recently left the plough to labor in a not less toilsome field the grave look and the intermingling of garments of a more classic cut would distinguish those who had begun to acquire the polish of their new residence and the air of superiority the paler cheek the less robust form the spectacles of green and the dress in general of threadbare black would designate the highest class who were understood to have acquired nearly all the science their alma mater could bestow and to be on the point of assuming their stations in the world there were it is true exceptions to this general description a few young men had found their way hither from the distant seaports and these were the models of fashion to their rustic companions over whom they asserted a superiority in exterior accomplishments which the fresh though unpolished intellect of the sons of the forest denied them in their literary competitions a third class differing widely from both the former consisted of a few young descendants of the aborigines to whom an impracticable philanthropy was endeavoring to impart the benefits of civilization if this institution did not offer all the advantages of elder and prouder seminaries its deficiencies were compensated to its students by the inculcation of regular habits and of a deep and awful sense of religion which seldom deserted them in their course through life the mild and gentle rule of dr melmoth like that of a father over his children was more destructive to vice than a sterner sway and though youth is never without its follies they have seldom been more harmless than they were here the students indeed ignorant of their own bliss sometimes wished to hasten the time of their entrance on the business of life but they found in after years that many of their happiest remembrances many of the scenes which they would with least reluctance live over again referred to the seat of their early studies the exceptions to this remark were chiefly those whose vices had drawn down even from that paternal government a weighty retribution dr melmoth at the time when he is to be introduced to the reader had borne the matrimonial yoke and in his case it was no light burden nearly twenty years the blessing of children however had been denied him a circumstance which he was accustomed to consider as one of the sorest trials that checkered his pathway for he was a man of a kind and affectionate heart that was continually seeking objects to rest itself upon he was inclined to believe also that a common offspring would have exerted a meliorating influence on the temper of mrs melmoth the character of whose domestic government often compelled him to call to mind such portions of the wisdom of antiquity as relate to the proper endurance of the shrewishness of woman but domestic comforts as well as comforts of every other kind have their drawbacks and so long as the balance is on the side of happiness a wise man will not murmur such was the opinion of dr melmoth and with a little aid from philosophy and more from religion he journeyed on contentedly through life when the storm was loud by the parlor hearth he had always a sure and quiet retreat in his study and there in his deep though not always useful labors he soon forgot whatever of disagreeable nature pertained to his situation this small and dark apartment was the only portion of the house to which since one firmly repelled invasion mrs melmoth s omnipotence did not extend here to reverse the words of queen elizabeth there was but one master and no mistress and that man has little right to complain who possesses so much as one corner in the world where he may be happy or miserable as best suits him in his study then the doctor was accustomed to spend most of the hours that were unoccupied by the duties of his station the flight of time was here as swift as the wind and noiseless as the snow flake and it was a sure proof of real happiness that night often came upon the student before he knew it was midday dr melmoth was wearing

education had associated him and who in his early manhood had been his chief intimate circumstances however had separated them for nearly thirty years half of which had been spent by his friend who

hereafter see is a sure sign of the revolving movement i will assume that it made at least one revolution during the first twenty four hours early the next morning its position was marked and it made a second revolution in hrs during the latter part of this revolution it moved much quicker and the third circle was performed in the evening in a little over hrs as on the succeeding morning i found that the shoot revolved in hrs m it must have made during the night four revolutions each at the average rate of a little over hrs i should add that the temperature of the room varied only a little the shoot had now grown inches in length and carried at its extremity a young internode inch in length which showed slight changes in its curvature the next or ninth revolution was effected in hrs m from this time forward the revolutions were easily observed the thirty sixth revolution was performed at the usual rate so was the last or thirty seventh but it was not completed for the internode suddenly became upright and after moving to the centre remained motionless i tied a weight to its upper end so as to bow it slightly and thus detect any movement but there was none some time before the last revolution was half performed the lower part of the internode ceased to move a few more remarks will complete all that need be said about this internode it moved during five days but the more rapid movements after the performance of the third revolution lasted during three days and twenty hours the regular revolutions from the ninth to thirty sixth inclusive were effected at the average rate of hrs m but the weather was cold and this affected the temperature of the room especially during the night and consequently retarded the rate of movement a little there was only one irregular movement which consisted in the stem rapidly making after an unusually slow revolution only the segment of a circle after the seventeenth revolution the internode had grown from to inches in length and carried an internode inch long which was just perceptibly moving and this carried a very minute ultimate internode after the twenty first revolution the penultimate internode was inches long and probably revolved in a period of about three hours at the twenty seventh revolution the lower and still moving internode was the penultimate and the ultimate inches in length and the inclination of the whole shoot was such that a circle inches in diameter was swept by it when the movement ceased the lower internode was inches and the penultimate inches in length so that from the twenty seventh to thirty seventh revolutions inclusive three internodes were at the same time revolving the lower internode when it ceased revolving became upright and rigid but as the whole shoot was left to grow unsupported it became after a time bent into a nearly horizontal position the uppermost and growing internodes still revolving at the extremity but of course no longer round the old central point of the supporting stick from the changed position of the centre of gravity of the extremity as it revolved a slight and slow swaying movement was given to the long horizontally projecting shoot and this movement i at first thought was a spontaneous one as the shoot grew it hung down more and more whilst the growing and revolving extremity turned itself up more and more with the hop we have seen that three internodes were at the same time revolving and this was the case with most of the plants observed by me with all if in full health two internodes revolved so that by the time the lower one ceased to revolve the one above was in full action with a terminal internode just commencing to move with hoya carnosa on the other hand a depending shoot without any developed leaves inches in length and consisting of seven internodes a minute terminal one an inch in length being counted continually but slowly swayed from side to side in a semicircular course with the extreme internodes making complete revolutions this swaying movement was certainly due to the movement of the lower internodes which however had not force sufficient to swing the whole shoot round the central supporting stick the case of another asclepiadaceous plant viz ceropegia gardnerii is worth briefly giving i allowed the top to grow out almost horizontally to the length of inches this now consisted of three long internodes terminated by two short ones the whole revolved in a course opposed to the sun the reverse of that of the hop at rates between hrs m and hrs m for each revolution the extreme tip thus made a circle of above feet or inches in diameter and feet in circumference travelling at the rate of or inches per hour the weather being hot the plant was allowed to stand on my study table and it was an interesting spectacle to watch the long shoot sweeping this grand circle night and day in search of some object round which to twine if we take hold of a growing sapling we can of course bend it to all sides in succession so as to make the tip describe a circle like that performed by the summit of a spontaneously revolving plant by this movement the sapling is not in the least twisted round its own axis i mention this because if a black point be painted on the bark on the side which is uppermost when the sapling is bent towards the holder s body as the circle is described the black point gradually turns round and sinks to the lower side and comes up again when the circle is completed and this gives the false appearance of twisting which in the case of spontaneously revolving plants

said rollo i can try it in the house said lucy where the sun shines in at my chamber window o no said rollo that won t do why not said lucy because the window does not come down to the floor and so does not let the sun in enough o that makes no difference said lucy we have nothing to do with the bottom of the door you only mark where it shines in the farthest and that place is made by the top of the door for it shines in farthest by the top of the door well said rollo i don t know but that the house will do but then you can t chalk on the carpet chalk on the carpet said lucy yes to mark the place no said lucy thinking but i can mark it some other way how asked rollo why i can put a pin in said lucy o dear said rollo with a laugh put a pin in that s no way to mark a shadow it isn t a shadow said lucy yes it is said rollo no said lucy a shadow is dark and this is bright yes said rollo this is a bright shadow some shadows are bright and some are dark o rollo said lucy and she turned away from him a little out of humor the truth was that rollo and lucy were getting decidedly into a dispute from the sublime heights of practical astronomy they had fallen by a sad and very rapid descent to a childish altercation rollo had a very high idea of the superior facilities afforded by jonas s barn floor for observing the daily changes in the sun s meridian altitude and he did not like the idea of lucy s finding that she had equally good opportunities for observation at her home lucy was a little fretted at rollo s captious spirit but then her mind soon became unruffled again and she turned back towards rollo and said as they walked along the yard i don t think the sunshine on the floor is a shadow rollo but then i don t see why a shadow would not do just as well how said rollo why look there at the shadow of that post that would do she pointed to a post with a rounded top upon it which stood by the side of the garden gate the shadow clear distinct and well defined was projected upon the walk and lucy told rollo that they might mark the place where the top of that shadow came every day and that that would do just as well but how could we mark it said rollo why we could drive a little stake unto the ground o that would not do said rollo people would trip over them and break them down they would be exactly in the walk lucy saw that this would be a difficulty and for a moment seemed to be at a loss at length she said we might go somewhere else then where the people would not come but what should we do for a post said rollo could not we get jonas to drive a tall stake down said lucy yes said rollo i suppose so the children went out into the garden to find a good smooth place and while they were walking about there rollo s mother came out and they told her the whole story she seemed quite interested in the plan and told them of a better way than any that they had thought of you see said she that the height of the stake or pole that makes the shadow is not material for the shadow of a small one will vary just as much in proportion to its length as that of a long one will so instead of taking a wooden stake out of doors you might take a large pin and drive it down a little way into the window sill in the house then you can mark the shadow with a pen very exactly so we can said lucy clapping her hands and you might put a piece of white paper or a card down first continued rollo s mother and drive the pin through that and then mark the places where the end of the shadow comes every day directly on the card with a fine pen thus you could be a great deal more exact than you can in chalking upon a barn floor rollo asked his mother if she would not be kind enough to help them fix their apparatus but she said she would give them particular directions though she should prefer letting them do the whole themselves and then if they met with any difficulties they might come and report them to her and she would tell them how to surmount them so she recommended to them to go and find a blank card or piece of white pasteboard or of stiff white paper as big as a common card then said she choose some window where the sun shines in at noon and put the card down upon the sill and drive the pin down through it but you must not drive the pin through the middle of the card for the shadow will always be off to the north of the pin and therefore the pin may be pretty near the south end of the card then the shadow will be more likely to come wholly upon the card even when it is longest you had better place the card in such a position too that its sides shall lie in the direction of north and south then the shadow at noon will lie along exactly in the middle of it you must get a large and stout pin too and drive it in firmly a little way with a small hammer it will be well too to drive another smaller pin into the other end of the card so as to keep it fixed in its north and south position how can we know when it is north and south exactly said lucy you cannot do it exactly said rollo s mother but you can get it pretty near one way is to borrow father s little compass and adjust it by that another way is to see when it is

the child for the purpose of gratifying my curiosity i love these little people and it is not a slight thing when they who are so fresh from god love us as i had felt pleased at first by her confidence i determined to deserve it and to do credit to the nature which had prompted her to repose it in me there was no reason however why i should refrain from seeing the person who had inconsiderately sent her to so great a distance by night and alone and as it was not improbable that if she found herself near home she might take farewell of me and deprive me of the opportunity i avoided the most frequented ways and took the most intricate and thus it was not until we arrived in the street itself that she knew where we were clapping her hands with pleasure and running on before me for a short distance my little acquaintance stopped at a door and remaining on the step till i came up knocked at it when i joined her a part of this door was of glass unprotected by any shutter which i did not observe at first for all was very dark and silent within and i was anxious as indeed the child was also for an answer to our summons when she had knocked twice or thrice there was a noise as if some person were moving inside and at length a faint light appeared through the glass which as it approached very slowly the bearer having to make his way through a great many scattered articles enabled me to see both what kind of person it was who advanced and what kind of place it was through which he came it was an old man with long grey hair whose face and figure as he held the light above his head and looked before him as he approached i could plainly see though much altered by age i fancied i could recognize in his spare and slender form something of that delicate mould which i had noticed in the child their bright blue eyes were certainly alike but his face was so deeply furrowed and so very full of care that here all resemblance ceased the place through which he made his way at leisure was one of those receptacles for old and curious things which seem to crouch in odd corners of this town and to hide their musty treasures from the public eye in jealousy and distrust there were suits of mail standing like ghosts in armour here and there fantastic carvings brought from monkish cloisters rusty weapons of various kinds distorted figures in china and wood and iron and ivory tapestry and strange furniture that might have been designed in dreams the haggard aspect of the little old man was wonderfully suited to the place he might have groped among old

hero a higher power saved him and by training him in the school of adversity made him both a lion and a lamb the training was very severe and prolonged however it was long before the lion would consent to lie down in the same breast with the lamb certainly it was not during the season of childhood the lion appeared to have it all his own way during that interesting epoch and the father was

admiration and was equally surprised and pleased at hearing in reply a nobleman named whom we shall call lord woodville how fortunate much of browne s early recollections both at school and at college had been connected with young woodville whom by a few questions he now ascertained to be the same with the owner of this fair domain he had been raised to the peerage by the decease of his father a few months before and as the general learned from the landlord the term of mourning being ended was now taking possession of his paternal estate in the jovial season of merry autumn accompanied by a select party of friends to enjoy the sports of a country famous for game this was delightful news to our traveller frank woodville had been richard browne s fag at eton and his chosen intimate at christ church their pleasures and their tasks had been the same and the honest soldier s heart warmed to find his early friend in possession of so delightful a residence and of an estate as the landlord assured him with a nod and a wink fully adequate to maintain and add to his dignity nothing was more natural than that the traveller should suspend a journey which there was nothing to render hurried to pay a visit to an old friend under such agreeable circumstances the fresh horses therefore had only the brief task of conveying the general s travelling carriage to woodville castle a

of the bell had suspended the separation of the company bent on the various amusements of the morning for on entering the court of the chateau several young men were lounging about in their sporting dresses looking at and criticizing the dogs which the keepers held in readiness to attend their pastime as general browne alighted the young lord came to the gate of the hall and for an instant gazed as at a stranger upon the countenance of his friend on which war with its fatigues and its wounds had made a great alteration but the uncertainty lasted no longer than till the visitor had spoken and the hearty greeting which followed was such as can only be exchanged betwixt those who have passed together the merry days of careless boyhood or early youth if i could have formed a wish my dear browne said lord woodville it would have been to have you here of all men upon this occasion which my friends are good enough to hold as a sort of holiday do not think you have been unwatched during the years you have been absent from us i have traced you through your dangers your triumphs your misfortunes and was delighted to see that whether in victory or defeat the name of my old friend was always distinguished with applause the general made a suitable reply and congratulated his friend on his new dignities and the possession of a place and domain so beautiful nay you have seen nothing of it as yet said lord woodville and i trust you do not mean to leave us till you are better acquainted with it it is true i confess that my present party is pretty large and the old house like other places of the kind does not possess so much accommodation as the extent of the outward walls appears to promise but we can give you a comfortable old fashioned room and i venture to suppose that your campaigns have taught you to be glad of worse quarters the general shrugged his shoulders and laughed i presume he said the worst apartment in your chateau is considerably superior to the old tobacco cask in which i was fain to take up my night s lodging when i was in the bush as the virginians call it with the light corps there i lay like diogenes himself so delighted with my covering from the elements that i made a vain attempt to have it rolled on to my next quarters but my commander for the time would give way to no such luxurious provision and i took farewell of my beloved cask with tears in my eyes well then since you do not fear your quarters said lord woodville you will stay with me a week at least of guns dogs fishing rods flies and means of sport by sea and land we have enough and to spare you cannot pitch on an amusement but we will find the means of pursuing it but if you prefer the gun and pointers i will go with you myself and see whether you have mended your

explored as he sat at the table in this curious apartment with his high bald head of somewhat foreign cast he reminded me of some of those antique pictures of authors that i have seen in old spanish

development into anything other than their like one does not expect a mushroom to translate itself into a pineapple nor a betony to moralize itself into a lily nor a snapdragon to soften himself into a lilac it is very possible indeed that the recent phrenzy for the investigation of digestive and reproductive operations in plants may by this time have furnished the microscopic malice of botanists with providentially disgusting reasons or demoniacally nasty necessities for every possible spur spike jag sting rent blotch flaw freckle filth or venom which can be detected in the construction or distilled from the dissolution of vegetable organism but with these obscene processes and prurient apparitions the gentle and happy scholar of flowers has nothing whatever to do i am amazed and saddened more than i can care to say by finding how much that is abominable may be discovered by an ill taught curiosity in the purest things that earth is allowed to produce for us perhaps if we were less reprobate in our own ways the grass which is our type might conduct itself better even though it has no hope but of being cast into the oven in the meantime healthy human eyes and thoughts are to be set on the lovely laws of its growth and habitation and not on the mean mysteries of its birth i relieve therefore our presently inquiring souls from any farther care as to the reason for a violet s spur or for the extremely ugly arrangements of its stamens and style invisible unless by vexatious and vicious peeping you are to think of a violet only in its green leaves and purple or golden petals you are to know the varieties of form in both proper to common species and in what kind of places they all most fondly live and most deeply glow and the recreation of the minde which is taken heereby cannot be but verie good and honest for they admonish and stir up a man to that which is comely and honest for flowers through their beautie varietie of colour and exquisite forme do bring to a liberall and gentle manly minde the remembrance of honestie comeliness and all kinds of vertues for it would be an unseemely and filthie thing as a certain wise man saith for him that doth looke upon and handle faire and beautiful things and who frequenteth and is conversant in faire and beautiful places to have his mind not faire but filthie and deformed thus gerarde in the close of his introductory notice of the violet speaking of things honesty comeliness and the like scarcely now recognized as desirable in the realm of england but having previously observed that violets are useful for the making of garlands for the head and posies to smell to in which last function i observe they are still pleasing to the british public and i found the children here only the other day munching a confection of candied violet leaves what pleasure the flower can still give us uncandied and unbound but in its own place and life i will try to trace through some of its constant laws and first let us be clear that the native colour of the violet is violet and that the white and yellow kinds though pretty in their place and way are not to be thought of in generally meditating the flower s quality or power a white violet is to black ones what a black man is to white ones and the yellow varieties are i believe properly pansies and belong also to wild districts for the most part but the true violet which i have just now called black with gerarde the blacke or purple violet hath a great prerogative above others and all the nobler species of the pansy itself are of full purple inclining however in the ordinary wild violet to blue in the laws of f sole chap vii i have made this dark pansy the representative of purple pure the viola odorata of the link between that full purple and blue and the heath blossom of the link between that full purple and red the reader will do well as much as may be possible to him to associate his study of botany as indeed all other studies of visible things with that of painting but he must remember that he cannot know what violet colour really is unless he watch the flower in its early growth it becomes dim in age and dark when it is gathered at least when it is tied in bunches but i am under the impression that the colour actually deadens also at all events no other single flower of the same quiet colour lights up the ground near it as a violet will the bright hounds tongue looks merely like a spot of bright paint but a young violet glows like painted glass which when you have once well noticed the two lines of milton and shakspeare which seem opposed will both become clear to you the said lines are dragged from hand to hand along their pages of pilfered quotations by the hack botanists who probably never saw them nor anything else in shakspeare or milton in their lives till even in reading them where they rightly come you can scarcely recover their fresh meaning but none of the botanists ever think of asking why perdita calls the violet dim and milton glowing perdita indeed calls it dim at that moment in thinking of her own love and the hidden passion of it unspeakable nor is milton without some purpose of using it as an emblem of love mourning but in both cases the subdued and quiet hue of the flower as an actual tint of colour and the strange force and life of it as a part of light are felt

mountainous more inaccessible more war loving more wild than any other country in the world the king with whom we waged war was a potentate who by his military talents had raised himself from a comparatively obscure position to the sovereignty of all abyssinia he was enlightened beyond his race patronised strangers encouraged manufactures endeavoured in every way to improve the condition of his country and was yet a bloodthirsty tyrant the people themselves were a strange race far more civilised than other african nations christians in the midst of a mahometan and pagan continent a mixture of many races x x african greek arab and jew altogether it was a land of romance nor had travellers done much to enlighten us as to the country some had described it as fertile in the extreme

expedition was to partake strongly of the nature of a forlorn hope the friends of officers and men said good bye to them as if they were going to certain death and insurance offices doubled and trebled the premium upon their lives all this assisted to raise the public interest and anxiety to the highest point it is needless now to say that almost the whole of the adverse predictions were entirely falsified and that we have met with no difficulties whatever beyond mountain and ravine the want of transport and the scarcity of food generally as the subject is known it is yet necessary before commencing the history of the campaign to say a few words upon the events which preceded and caused it and as the subject has been exhausted by dr beke in his able work on the abyssinian captives i cannot do better than preface my story with a brief epitome of the facts recited in his volume dr beke was well acquainted with mr plowden our late consul there and knew thoroughly the whole of the events which led to the captivity of the english party and he was in intimate communication with their friends here his statements are supported by numerous official documents and this volume in which he now sets forth the state of the case may be apparently received with confidence as reliable in every particular the kingdom of abyssinia is of extreme antiquity and was once a great and flourishing empire it has been ruled by a succession of monarchs claiming direct descent from menilek the son of king solomon by the queen of sheba for the last century the legitimate monarch has had very little power the real authority being in the hands of the most powerful of the chiefs of the various tribes composing the empire and who as in turns they became dominant assumed the title of ras or vizier keeping the puppet emperor in a state of honourable captivity administering affairs and carrying on wars without the slightest reference to his wishes and opinions the kingdom of abyssinia consists of an immense elevated plateau or table land of great fertility and possessing a temperate and agreeable climate at its north eastern extremity it approaches very nearly to the sea the port of massowah at that point being its natural outlet towards the south the table land trends away from the sea being separated from it by a wide low lying plain inhabited by mahometan tribes the religion of the natives of abyssinia itself has been from very early times christian and they possess a native version of the scriptures which dates from the fourth century of the christian era the laws of this singular people are like our own founded upon the code of justinian the various tribes which form the empire although acknowledging the supremacy of the emperor are yet virtually independent paying a mere nominal tribute and making war upon and deposing him whenever they feel strong enough to do so these tribes are very numerous but the principal may be considered to be those inhabiting tigre which is the province nearest to massowah and therefore commanding the avenues of approach to the interior amhara the capital lying to the south of tigre lasta in the centre and shoa

raspberries near the house but one autumn when jonas had a good deal of ploughing to do down the lane he ploughed up the ground by the fences in this lane making one furrow every time he went up and down to his other work then in the spring he ploughed it again and by this time the turf had rotted and so the land had become mellow then jonas went away with the wagon one afternoon about two miles to a place where the raspberries were very abundant and dug up a large number of them and set them out along this lane on both sides of it and so in a year or two there was a great abundance of raspberries very near the house rollo stopped to eat some raspberries as he walked along he thought they would do exceedingly well with his bread to give a little variety to his luncheon after he had eaten as many as he wanted he thought he would gather his dipper full for jonas as he was busy at work and could not have time to gather any for himself he got his dipper full very quick for the raspberries were thick and large he thought it was an excellent plan for jonas to plant the raspberry bushes there but then he thought it was a great deal of trouble to bring them all from so great a distance i wonder said he to himself as he sat upon a log thinking of the subject why it would not have been just as well to plant raspberries themselves instead of setting out the bushes the raspberries must be the seeds i mean to take some of these big ones and try i dare say they ll grow but then he reflected that the spring was planting time and he knew very well that raspberries would not keep till spring and so he determined to ask jonas about it he accordingly rose up from the log and walked along carrying his dipper very carefully in his hand at length he reached the brook there was a rude bridge over it made of two logs placed side by side and short boards nailed across them for a foot way it was only wide enough for persons to walk across the cattle and teams always went across through the water at a shallow place just below the bridge rollo lay down upon the bridge and looked into the water there were some skippers and some whirlabouts upon the water the skippers were long legged insects shaped somewhat like a cricket and they stood tiptoe upon the surface of the water rollo wondered how they could keep up their feet did not sink into the water at all and every now and then they would give a sort of leap and away they would shoot over the surface as if it had been ice rollo reached his hand down and tried to catch one to examine his feet but he could not succeed they were too nimble for him he thought that if he could only catch one and have an opportunity to examine his feet he could see how it was that he could stand so upon the water rollo was considering whether it was possible or not that jonas might make something like the skippers feet for him to put upon his feet so that he might walk on the water when suddenly he heard a bubbling sound in the brook near the shore he looked there and saw some bubbles of air coming up out of the bottom and rising to the top of the water he thought this was very singular it was not strange that the air should come up through the water to the top for air is much lighter than water the wonder was how the air could ever get down there from wondering at this extraordinary phenomenon rollo began to wonder at another quite different question that is where all the water in the brook could come from he looked at a little cascade just above the bridge where the water rushed through a narrow place between two rocks and watched it a few minutes wondering that it should continue running so all the time forever and surprised also that he had never wondered at it before he looked into the clear transparent current which poured steadily down between the rocks and said to himself strange there it runs and runs all the time all day and all night all summer and all winter all this year and all last year and every year where can all the water come from then he thought that he should like to follow the brook up and find where it came from but he concluded that it must be a great way to go through bushes and rocks and marshes and he saw at once that the expedition was out of the question for him just then he heard another gurgling in the water near him and looking down he saw more bubbles coming up to the surface very near where they had come up before rollo thought he would get a stick and see if he could not poke up the mud and find out what there was down there to make such a bubbling he thought that perhaps it might be some sort of animal blowing he went off of the bridge therefore and began to look about for a stick he had just found one when all at once he heard a noise in the bushes he looked up suddenly not knowing what was coming but in a moment saw jonas walking along towards him ah jonas said rollo are you going home yes said jonas unless you will go for me well said rollo what do you want me to get i want some fire to burn up some brush you can bring out the lantern very well said rollo i will go only i wish you would tell me where these bubbles come from out of the bottom of the brook what bubbles said jonas so rollo took his stick and pushed the end of it down into the mud and that made more bubbles come up they are bubbles of air said jonas but how comes the air down there said rollo under the water i don t know said jonas and besides i must not stay and talk here i must go back to my work i will talk to you about it when you come back so

his and she with two small children turned into the streets a begging it is a circumstance not to be forgotten that she was very young under nineteen and most remarkably handsome she went to a linen draper s shop took some coarse linen off the counter and slipped it under her cloak the shopman saw her and she laid it down for this she was hanged her defence was i have the trial in my pocket that she had lived in credit and wanted for nothing till a press gang came and stole her husband from her but since then she had no bed to lie on nothing to give her children to eat and they were almost naked and perhaps she might have done something wrong for she hardly knew what she did the parish officers testified the truth of this story but it seems there had been a good deal of shop lifting about ludgate an example was thought necessary and this woman was hanged for the comfort and satisfaction of shopkeepers in ludgate street when brought to receive sentence she behaved in such a frantic manner as proved her mind to be in a distracted and desponding state and the child was sucking at her breast when she set out for tyburn chapter in the year there stood upon the borders of epping forest at a distance of about twelve miles from london measuring from the standard in cornhill or rather from the spot on or near to which the standard used to be in days of yore a house of public entertainment called the maypole which fact was demonstrated to all such travellers as could neither read nor write and at that time a vast number both of travellers and stay at homes were in this condition by the emblem reared on the roadside over against the house which if not of those goodly proportions that maypoles were wont to present in olden times was a fair young ash thirty feet in height and straight as any arrow that ever english yeoman drew the maypole by which term from henceforth is meant the house and not its sign the maypole was an old building with more gable ends than a lazy man would care to count on a sunny day huge zig zag chimneys out of which it seemed as though even smoke could not choose but come in more than naturally fantastic shapes imparted to it in its tortuous progress and vast stables gloomy ruinous and empty the place was said to have been built in the days of king henry the eighth and there was a legend not only that queen elizabeth had slept there one night while upon a hunting excursion to wit in a certain oak panelled room with a deep bay window but that next morning while standing on a mounting block before the door with one foot in the stirrup the virgin monarch had then and there boxed and cuffed an unlucky page for some neglect of duty the matter of fact and doubtful folks of whom there were a few among the maypole customers as unluckily there always are in every little community were inclined to look upon this tradition as rather apocryphal but whenever the landlord of that ancient hostelry appealed to the mounting block itself as evidence and triumphantly pointed out that there it stood in the same place to that very day the doubters never failed to be put down by a large majority and all true believers exulted as in a victory whether these and many other stories of the like nature were true or untrue the maypole was really an old house a very old house perhaps as old as it claimed to be and perhaps older which will sometimes happen with houses of an uncertain as with ladies of a certain age its windows were old diamond pane lattices its floors were sunken and uneven its ceilings blackened by the hand of time and heavy with massive beams over the doorway was an ancient porch quaintly and grotesquely carved and here on summer evenings the more favoured customers smoked and drank ay and sang many a good song too sometimes reposing on two grim looking high backed settles which like the twin dragons of some fairy tale guarded the entrance to the mansion in the chimneys of the disused rooms swallows had built their nests for many a long year and from earliest spring to latest autumn whole colonies of sparrows chirped and twittered in the eaves there were more pigeons about the dreary stable yard and out buildings than anybody but the landlord could reckon up the wheeling and circling flights of runts fantails tumblers and pouters were perhaps not quite consistent with the grave and sober character of the building but the monotonous cooing which never ceased to be raised by some among them all day long suited it exactly and seemed to lull it to rest with its overhanging stories drowsy little panes of glass and front bulging out and projecting over the pathway the old house looked as if it were nodding in its sleep indeed it needed no very great stretch of fancy to detect in it other resemblances to humanity the bricks of which it was built had originally been a deep dark red but had grown yellow and discoloured like an old man s skin the sturdy timbers had decayed like teeth and here and there the ivy like a warm garment to comfort it in its age wrapt its green leaves closely round the time worn walls it was a hale and hearty age though still and in the summer or autumn evenings when the glow of the setting sun fell upon the oak and chestnut trees of the adjacent forest the old house partaking of its lustre seemed their fit companion and to have

chapter and the beginning of chapter a revised and expanded version of the first part of mathilda s narrative follows chapter and the beginning of chapter with a break between the account of her girlhood in scotland and the brief description of her father after his return finally there are four pages of a new opening which was used in mathilda this is an extremely rough draft punctuation is largely confined to the dash and there are many corrections and alterations the shelley rolls fragments twenty five sheets or slips of paper usually represent additions to or revisions of the fields of fancy many of them are numbered and some are keyed into the manuscript in lord abinger s notebook most of the changes were incorporated in mathilda the second abinger notebook contains the complete and final draft of mathilda pages it is for the most part a fair copy the text is punctuated and there are relatively few corrections most of them apparently the result of a final rereading made to avoid the repetition of words a few additions are written in the margins on several pages slips of paper containing evident revisions quite possibly originally among the shelley rolls fragments have been pasted over the corresponding lines of the text an occasional passage is scored out and some words and phrases are crossed out to make way for a revision following page four sheets containing the conclusion of the story are cut out of the notebook they appear the pages numbered to among the shelley rolls fragments a revised version pages to follows the cut iv the mode of telling the story in the final draft differs radically from that in the rough draft in the fields of fancy mathilda s history is set in a fanciful framework the author is transported by the fairy fantasia to the elysian fields where she listens to the discourse of diotima and meets mathilda mathilda tells her story which closes with her death in the final draft this unrealistic and largely irrelevant framework is discarded mathilda whose death is approaching writes out for her friend woodville the full details of her tragic history which she had never had the courage to tell him in person the title of the rough draft the fields of fancy and the setting and framework undoubtedly stem from mary wollstonecraft s unfinished tale the cave of fancy in which one of the souls confined in the center of the earth to purify themselves from the dross of their earthly existence tells to sagesta who may be compared with diotima the story of her ill fated love for a man whom she hopes to rejoin after her purgation is completed v mary was completely familiar with her mother s works this title was of course abandoned when the framework was abandoned and the name of the heroine was substituted though it is worth noticing that mary chose a name with the same initial letter as her own it was probably taken from dante there are several references in the story to the cantos of the purgatorio in which mathilda appears mathilda s father is never named nor is mathilda s surname given the name of the poet went through several changes welford lovel herbert and finally woodville the evidence for dating mathilda in the late summer and autumn of comes partly from the manuscript partly from mary s journal on the pages succeeding the portions of the fields of fancy in the bodleian notebook are some of shelley s drafts of verse and prose including parts of prometheus unbound and of epipsychidion both in italian and of the preface to the latter in english some prose fragments and extended portions of the defence of poetry written from the other end of the book are the ode to naples and the witch of atlas since these all belong to the years and it is probable that mary finished her rough draft some time in and that when she had copied her story shelley took over the notebook chapter of mathilda in lord abinger s notebook is headed florence nov th since the whole of mathilda s story takes place in england and scotland the date must be that of the manuscript mary was in florence at that time these dates are supported by entries in mary s journal which indicate that she began writing mathilda early in august while the shelleys were living in the villa valosano near leghorn on august after a gap of two months from the time of her little son s death she resumed her diary almost every day thereafter for a month she recorded write and by september she was saying copy on september she wrote finish copying my tale the next entry to indicate literary activity is the one word write on november on the th percy florence was born and mary did no more writing until march when she was working on valperga it is probable therefore that mary wrote and copied mathilda between august and september that she did some revision on november and finally dated the manuscript november the subsequent history of the manuscript is recorded in letters and journals when the gisbornes went to

remembrance of the heir presumptive the very william walter elliot esq whose rights had been so generously supported by her father had disappointed her she had while a very young girl as soon as she

youth and in one of their spring excursions to london when elizabeth was in her first bloom mr elliot had been forced into the introduction he was at that time a very young man just engaged in the study of the law and elizabeth found him extremely agreeable and every plan in his favour was confirmed he was invited to kellynch hall he was talked of and expected all the rest of the year but he never came the following spring he was seen again in town found equally agreeable again encouraged invited and expected and again he did not come and the next tidings were that he was married instead of pushing his fortune in the line marked out for the heir of the house of elliot he had purchased independence by uniting himself to a rich woman of inferior birth sir walter has resented it as the

assertion which is open to criticism i should have replied that as in all our experience we have never known a species created it was by his own showing unphilosophical to assume that any species ever had been created those who cavalierly reject the theory of evolution as not being adequately supported by facts seem to forget that their own theory is supported by no facts at all like the majority of men who are born to a given belief they demand the most rigorous proof of any adverse belief but assume that their own needs none here we find scattered over the globe vegetable and animal organisms numbering of the one kind according to humboldt some species and of the other some species see carpenter and if to these we add the numbers of animal and vegetable species which have become extinct we may safely estimate the number of species that have existed and are existing on the earth at not less than ten millions well which is the most rational theory about these ten millions of species is it most likely that there have been ten millions of special creations or is it most likely that by continual modifications due to change of circumstances ten millions of varieties have been produced as varieties are being produced still doubtless many will reply that they can more easily conceive ten millions of special creations to have taken place than they can conceive that ten millions of varieties have arisen by successive modifications all such however will find on inquiry that they are under an illusion this is one of the many cases in which men do not really believe but rather believe they believe it is not that they can truly conceive ten millions of special creations to have taken place but that they think they can do so careful introspection will show them that they have never yet realized to themselves the creation of even one species if they have formed a definite conception of the process let them tell us how a new species is constructed and how it makes its appearance is it thrown down from the clouds or must we hold to the notion that it struggles up out of the ground do its limbs and viscera rush together from all the points of the compass or must we receive the old hebrew idea that god takes clay and moulds a new creature if they say that a new creature is produced in none of these modes which are too absurd to be believed then they are required to describe the mode in which a new creature may be produced a mode which does not seem absurd and such a mode they will find that they neither have conceived nor can conceive should the believers in special creations consider it unfair thus to call upon them to describe how special creations take place i reply that this is far less than they demand from the supporters of the development hypothesis they are merely asked to point out a conceivable mode on the other hand they ask not simply for a conceivable mode but for the actual mode they do not say show us how this may take place but they say show us how this does take place so far from its being unreasonable to put the above question it would be reasonable to ask not only for a possible mode of special creation but for an ascertained mode seeing that this is no greater a demand than they make upon their opponents and here we may perceive how much more defensible the new doctrine is than the old one even could the supporters of the development hypothesis merely show that the origination of species by the process of modification is conceivable they would be in a better position than their opponents but they can do much more than this they can show that the process of modification has effected and is effecting decided changes in all organisms subject to modifying influences though from the impossibility of getting at a sufficiency of facts they are unable to trace the many phases through which any existing species has passed in arriving at its present form or to identify the influences which caused the successive modifications yet they can show that any existing species animal or vegetable when placed under conditions different from its previous ones immediately begins to undergo certain changes fitting it for the new conditions they can show that in successive generations these changes continue until ultimately the new conditions become the natural ones they can show that in cultivated plants in domesticated animals and in the several races of men such alterations have taken place they can show that the degrees of difference so produced are often as in dogs greater than those on which distinctions of species are in other cases founded they can show that it is a matter of dispute whether some of these modified forms are varieties or separate species they can show too that the changes daily taking place in ourselves the facility that attends long practice and the loss of aptitude that begins when practice ceases the strengthening of passions habitually gratified and the weakening of those habitually curbed the development of every faculty bodily moral or intellectual according to the use made of it are all explicable on this same principle and thus they can show that

confusions falsehoods and absurdities covering the whole field of life a thing that fills us with astonishment almost if it were possible with incredulity for truly it is not easy to understand that sane men could ever calmly with their eyes open believe and live by such a set of doctrines that men should have worshipped their poor fellow man as a god and not him only but stocks and stones and all manner of animate and inanimate objects and fashioned for themselves such a distracted chaos of hallucinations by way of theory of the universe all this looks like an incredible fable nevertheless it is a clear fact that they did it such hideous inextricable jungle of misworships misbeliefs men made as we are did actually hold by and live at home in this is strange yes we may pause in sorrow and silence over the depths of darkness that are in man if we rejoice in the heights of purer vision he has attained to such things were and are in man in all men in us too some speculators have a short way of accounting for the pagan religion mere quackery priestcraft and dupery say they no sane man ever did believe it merely contrived to persuade other men not worthy of the name of sane to believe it it will be often our duty to protest against this sort of hypothesis about men s doings and history and i here on the very threshold protest against it in reference to paganism and to all other isms by which man has ever for a length of time striven to walk in this world they have all had a truth in them or men would not have taken them up quackery and dupery do abound in religions above all in the more advanced decaying stages of religions they have fearfully abounded but quackery was never the originating influence in such things it was not the health and life of such things but their disease the sure precursor of their being about to die let us never forget this it seems to me a most mournful hypothesis that of quackery giving birth to any faith even in savage men quackery gives birth to nothing gives death to all things we shall not see into the true heart of anything if we look merely at the quackeries of it if we do not reject the quackeries altogether as mere diseases corruptions with which our and all men s sole duty is to have done with them to sweep them out of our thoughts as out of our practice man everywhere is the born enemy of lies i find grand lamaism itself to have a kind of truth in it read the candid clear sighted rather sceptical mr turner s account of his embassy to that country and see they have their belief these poor thibet people that providence sends down always an incarnation of himself into every generation at bottom some belief in a kind of pope at bottom still better belief that there is a greatest man that he is discoverable that once discovered we ought to treat him with an obedience which knows no bounds this is the truth of grand lamaism the discoverability is the only error here the thibet priests have methods of their own of discovering what man is greatest fit to be supreme over them bad methods but are they so much worse than our methods of understanding him to be always the eldest born of a certain genealogy alas it is a difficult thing to find good methods for we shall begin to have a chance of understanding paganism when we first admit that to its followers it was at one time earnestly true let us consider it very certain that men did believe in paganism men with open eyes sound senses men made altogether like ourselves that we had we been there should have believed in it ask now what paganism could have been another theory somewhat more respectable attributes such things to allegory it was a play of poetic minds say these theorists a shadowing forth in allegorical fable in personification and visual form of what such poetic minds had known and felt of this universe which agrees add they with a primary law of human nature still everywhere observably at work though in less important things that what a man feels intensely he struggles to speak out of him to see represented before him in visual shape and as if with a kind of life and historical reality in it now doubtless there is such a law and it is one of the deepest in human nature neither need we doubt that it did operate fundamentally in this business the hypothesis which ascribes paganism wholly or mostly to this agency i call a little more respectable but i cannot yet call it the true hypothesis think would we believe and take with us as our life guidance an allegory a poetic sport not sport but earnest is what we should require it is a most earnest thing to be alive in this world to die is not sport for a man man s life never was a sport to him it was a stern reality altogether a serious matter to be alive i find therefore that though these allegory theorists are on the way towards truth in this matter they have not reached it either pagan religion is indeed an allegory a symbol of what men felt and knew about the universe and all religions are symbols of that altering always as that alters but it seems to me a radical perversion and even inversion of the business to put that forward as the origin and moving cause when it was rather the result and termination to get beautiful allegories a perfect poetic symbol was not the want of men but to know what they were to believe

touched the paper with the point of his twig when a low wild peal of laughter broke out at a measureless distance away and growing ever louder seemed approaching ever nearer a soulless heartless and unjoyous laugh like that of the loon solitary by the lakeside at midnight a laugh which culminated in an unearthly shout close at hand then died away by slow gradations as if the accursed being that uttered it had withdrawn over the verge of the world whence it had come but the man felt that this was not so that it was near by and had not moved a strange sensation began slowly to take possession of his body and his mind he could not have said which if any of his senses was affected he felt it rather as a consciousness a mysterious mental assurance of some overpowering presence some supernatural malevolence different in kind from the invisible existences that swarmed about him and superior to them in power he knew that it had uttered that hideous laugh and now it seemed to be approaching him from what direction he did not know dared not conjecture all his former fears were forgotten or merged in the gigantic terror that now held him in thrall apart from that he had but one thought to complete his written appeal to the benign powers who traversing the haunted wood might some time rescue him if he should be denied the blessing of annihilation he wrote with terrible rapidity the twig in his fingers rilling blood without renewal but in the middle of a sentence his hands denied their service to his will his arms fell to his sides the book to the earth and powerless

perhaps a trifle spoiled he had the double disadvantage of a mother s assiduity and a father s neglect frayser pere was what no southern man of means is not a politician his country or rather his section and state made demands upon his time and attention so exacting that to those of his family he was compelled to turn an ear partly deafened by the thunder of the political captains and the shouting his own included young halpin was of a dreamy indolent and rather romantic turn somewhat more addicted to literature than law the profession to which he was bred among those of his relations

bayne had in his lifetime been sufficiently affected to be a poet of no small colonial distinction if not specially observed it was observable that while a frayser who was not the proud possessor of a sumptuous copy of the ancestral poetical works printed at the family expense and long ago withdrawn from an inhospitable market was a rare frayser indeed there was an illogical indisposition to honor the great deceased in the person of his spiritual successor halpin was pretty generally deprecated as an intellectual black sheep who was likely at any moment to disgrace the flock by bleating in meter the tennessee fraysers were a practical folk not practical in the popular sense of devotion to sordid pursuits but having a robust contempt for any qualities unfitting a man for the wholesome vocation of politics in justice to young halpin it should be said that while in him were pretty faithfully reproduced most of the mental and moral characteristics ascribed by history and family tradition to the famous colonial bard his succession to the gift and faculty divine was purely inferential not only had he never been known to court the muse but in truth he could not have written

was born partly for that purpose when you have caught your rabbit and come back to where the men are cutting wood you will be just as proud to tell the boy who is cutting up the branches all about your splendid hunt as if you had chased and killed a stag there s where we started him you will cry and away he scudded over there among the chestnuts and rover right at his heels and when we got down there to the creek rover turned heels over head on the ice he was going so fast but i gave one slide right across and just up there by the big walnut the other two dogs got him that boy is almost as

tails between their legs the tree is down now and you will want to be home in time for dinner farmer brown s sled has just passed and if you will cut across the woods you can catch up with him and

certain extent a mere vehicle for the music and that it is scarcely fair or reasonable to judge it by those strict rules of criticism which would be justly applicable to a five act tragedy or a finished comedy there is no doubt that the merits of the play were based upon the songs set to hullah s music rather than upon the play itself and it is said that harley s reputation as a vocalist was established by his able rendering of them the village coquettes enjoyed a run of nineteen nights in london during the season and was then transferred to edinburgh where it was performed under the management of mr ramsay a friend of sir walter scott sala as a boy of ten witnessed its first representation in london and ever retained a vivid impression of the event while especial interest appertains to the fact that a copy of the play became the means of first bringing dickens into personal communication with john forster his life long friend and biographer it is more than probable that boz felt a little elated by the reception accorded by the public to the dramatic bantling but as time progressed he realised that the somewhat unfavourable comments of the critics were not entirely devoid of truth indeed when in it was proposed to revive the play he expressed a hope that it might be allowed to sink into its native obscurity i did it he explained in a fit of damnable good nature long ago for hullah who wrote some very pretty music to it i just put down for everybody what everybody at the st james s theatre wanted to say and do and what they could say and do best and i have been most sincerely repentant ever since the novelist confessed that both the operetta and a little farce called the strange gentleman the latter written as a practical joke for the st james s theatre about the same time were done without the least consideration or regard to reputation he also declared that he wouldn t repeat them for a thousand pounds apiece and devoutly wished these early dramatic efforts to be forgotten x propos of this the late frederick locker lampson has recorded that when he asked dickens about a year before the great writer s death whether he possessed a copy of the village coquettes his reply was no and if i knew it was in my house and if i could not get rid of it in any other way i would burn the wing of the house where it was although perhaps not of a high order of merit the village coquettes is not without bibliographical interest and may be regarded as a musical and literary curiosity copies of the first edition of the little

been developed from a common stock at least there is every reason to believe so but it is a most singular circumstance that while you may run through almost the whole series of physiological processes without finding a check to your argument you come at last to a point where you do find a check and that is in the reproductive processes for there is a most singular circumstance in respect to natural species at least about some of them and it would be sufficient for the purposes of this argument if it were true of only one of them but there is in fact a great number of such cases and that is that similar as they may appear to be to mere races or breeds they present a marked peculiarity in the reproductive process if you breed from the male and female of the same race you of course have offspring of the like kind and if you make the offspring breed together you obtain the same result and if you breed from these again you will still have the same kind of offspring there is no check but if you take members of two distinct species however similar they may be to each other and make them breed together you will find a check with some modifications and exceptions however which i shall speak of presently if you cross two such species with each other then although you may get offspring in the case of the first cross yet if you attempt to breed from the products of that crossing which are what are called hybrids that is if you couple a male and a female hybrid then the result is that in ninety nine cases out of a hundred you will get no offspring at all there will be no result whatsoever the reason of this is quite obvious in some cases the male hybrids although possessing all the external appearances and characteristics of perfect animals are physiologically imperfect and deficient in the structural parts of the reproductive elements necessary to generation it is said to be invariably the case with the male mule the cross between the ass and the mare and hence it is that although crossing the horse with the ass is easy enough and is constantly done as far as i am aware if you take two mules a male and a female and endeavour to breed from them you get no offspring whatever no generation will take place this is what is called the sterility of the hybrids between two distinct species you see that this is a very extraordinary circumstance one does not see why it should be the common teleological explanation is that it is to prevent the impurity of the blood resulting from the crossing of one species with another but you see it does not in reality do anything of the kind there is nothing in this fact that hybrids cannot breed with each other to establish such a theory there is nothing to prevent the horse breeding with the ass or the ass with the horse so that this explanation breaks down as a great many explanations of this kind do that are only founded on mere assumptions thus you see that there is a great difference between mongrels which are crosses between distinct races and hybrids which are crosses between distinct species the mongrels are so far as we know fertile with one another but between species in many cases you cannot succeed in obtaining even the first cross at any rate it is quite certain that the hybrids are often absolutely infertile one with another here is a feature then great or small as it may be which distinguishes natural species of animals can we find any approximation to this in the different races known to be produced by selective breeding from a common stock up to the present time the answer to that question is absolutely a negative one as far as we know at present there is nothing approximating to this check in crossing the breeds between the fantail and the pouter the carrier and the tumbler or any other variety or race you may name so far as we know at present there is no difficulty in breeding together the mongrels take the carrier and the fantail for instance and let them represent the horse and the ass in the case of distinct species then you have as the result of their breeding the carrier fantail mongrel we will say the male and female mongrel and as far as we know these two when crossed would not be less fertile than the original cross or than carrier with carrier here you see is a physiological contrast between the races produced by selective modification and natural species i shall inquire into the value of this fact and of some modifying circumstances by and by for the present i merely put it broadly before you but while considering this question of the limitations of species a word must be said about what is called recurrence the tendency of races which have been developed by selective breeding from varieties to return to their primitive type this is supposed by many to put an absolute limit to the extent of selective and all other variations people say it is all very well to talk about producing these different races but you know very well that if you turned all these birds wild these pouters and carriers and so on they would all return to their primitive stock this is very commonly assumed to be a fact and it is an argument that is commonly brought forward as conclusive but if you will take the trouble to inquire into it rather closely i think you will find that it is not worth very much the first question of course is do they thus return to the primitive stock and commonly as the thing is assumed and accepted it is extremely difficult to get anything like good evidence of it it is constantly said for example that if domesticated horses are turned wild as they have been in some parts of asia minor and south america that they return at once to the primitive stock from which they were bred but the\", \"target\": 2,

it was rough and black and clinging disagreeable to the eye in its shape as will always be the dress of any woman which is worn day after day through all hours by nature and education mrs prime was a prim tidy woman but it seemed that her peculiar ideas of duty required her to militate against her nature and education at any rate in appearance and this was her lot in life before she had yet reached her twentieth year dorothea ray had not been wanting in some feminine attraction she had ever been brown and homely but her features had been well formed and her eyes had been bright now as she approached to thirty years of age she might have been as well looking as at any earlier period of her life if it had been her wish to possess good looks but she had had no such wish on the contrary her desire had been to be ugly forbidding unattractive almost repulsive so that in very truth she might be known to be a widow indeed and here i must not be misunderstood there was nothing hypocritical about mrs prime nor did she make any attempt to appear before men to be weighted with a deeper sorrow than that which she truly bore hypocrisy was by no means her fault her fault was this that she had taught herself to believe that cheerfulness was a sin and that the more she became morose the nearer would she be to the fruition of those hopes of future happiness on which her heart was set in all her words and thoughts she was genuine but then in so very many of them she was mistaken this was the wall against which mrs ray had allowed herself to be fastened for many years past and though the support was strong it must be admitted that it could hardly have been at all times pleasant mrs ray had become a widow before she was thirty and she had grieved for her husband with truest sorrow pouring herself out at first in tears and afterwards expending herself in long hours of vain regrets but she had never been rough or hard in her widowhood it had ever been her nature to be soft she was a woman all over and had about her so much of a woman s prettiness that she had not altogether divested herself of it even when her weepers had been of the broadest to obtain favour in men s eyes had never been in her mind since she had first obtained favour in the eyes of him who had been her lord but yet she had never absolutely divested herself of her woman charms of that look half retreating half beseeching which had won the heart of the ecclesiastical lawyer gradually her weeds and her deep heavy crapes had fallen away from her and then without much thought on the matter she dressed herself much as did other women of forty or forty five being driven however on certain occasions by her daughter to a degree of dinginess not by any means rivalling that of the daughter herself but which she would not have achieved had she been left to her own devices she was a sweet tempered good humoured loving timid woman ever listening and believing and learning with a certain aptitude for gentle mirth at her heart which however was always being repressed and controlled by the circumstances of her life she could gossip over a cup of tea and enjoy buttered toast and hot cake very thoroughly if only there was no one near her to whisper into her ear that any such enjoyment was wicked in spite of the sorrows she had suffered she would have taught herself to believe this world to be a pleasant place were it not so often preached into her ears that it is a vale of tribulation in which no satisfaction can abide and it may be said of mrs ray that her religion though it sufficed her tormented her grievously it sufficed her and if on such a subject i may venture to give an opinion i think it was of a nature to suffice her in that great strait for which it had been prepared but in this world it tormented her carrying her hither and thither and leaving her in grievous doubt not as to its own truth in any of its details but as to her own conduct under its injunctions and also as to her own mode of believing in it in truth she believed too much she could never divide the minister from the bible nay the very clerk in the church was sacred to her while exercising his functions therein it never occurred to her to question any word that was said to her if a linen draper were to tell her that one coloured calico was better for her than another she would take that point as settled by the man s word and for the time would be free from all doubt on that heading so also when the clergyman in his sermon told her that she should live simply and

most beautiful and what you saw by the way was as worthy of note as the ultimate object to which you were journeying it is possible indeed that coleridge did not in fact possess the precise gladiatorial power of johnson yet he understood a sword play of his own and i have upon several occasions seen him exhibit brilliant proofs of its effectiveness upon disputants of considerable pretensions in their particular lines but he had a genuine dislike of the practice in himself or others and no slight provocation could move him to any such exertion he was indeed to my observation more distinguished from other great men of letters by his moral thirst after the truth the ideal truth in his own mind than by his merely intellectual qualifications to leave the everyday circle of society in which the literary and scientific rarely the rest never break through the spell of personality where anecdote reigns everlastingly paramount and exclusive and the mildest attempt to generalize the babel of facts and to control temporary and individual phenomena by the application of eternal and overruling principles is unintelligible to many and disagreeable to more to leave this species of converse if converse it deserves to be called and pass an entire day with coleridge was a marvellous change indeed it was a sabbath past expression deep and tranquil and serene you came to a man who had travelled in many countries and in critical times who had seen and felt the world in most of its ranks and in many of its vicissitudes and weaknesses one to whom all literature and genial art were absolutely subject and to whom with a reasonable allowance as to technical details all science was in a most extraordinary degree familiar throughout a long drawn summer s day would this man talk to you in low equable but clear and musical tones concerning things human and divine marshalling all history harmonizing all experiment probing the depths of your consciousness and revealing visions of glory and of terror to the imagination but pouring withal such floods of light upon the mind that you might for a season like paul become blind in the very act of conversion and this he would do without so much as one allusion to himself without a word of reflection on others save when any given act fell naturally in the way of his discourse without one anecdote that was not proof and illustration of a previous position gratifying no passion indulging no caprice but with a calm mastery over your soul leading you onward and onward for ever through a thousand windings yet with no pause to some magnificent point in which as in a focus all the party coloured rays of his discourse should converge in light in all this he was in truth your teacher and guide but in a little while you might forget that he was other than a fellow student and the companion of your way so playful was his manner so simple his language so affectionate the glance of his pleasant eye there were indeed some whom coleridge tired and some whom he sent asleep it would occasionally so happen when the abstruser mood was strong upon him and the visiter was narrow and ungenial i have seen him at times when you could not incarnate him when he shook aside your petty questions or doubts and burst with some impatience through the obstacles of common conversation then escaped from the flesh he would soar upwards into an atmosphere almost too rare to breathe but which seemed proper to him and there he would float at ease like enough what coleridge then said his subtlest listener would not understand as a man understands a newspaper but upon such a listener there would steal an influence and an impression and a sympathy there would be a gradual attempering of his body and spirit till his total being vibrated with one pulse alone and thought became merged in contemplation and so his senses gradually wrapt in a half sleep he d dream of better worlds and dreaming hear thee still o singing lark that sangest like an angel in the clouds but it would be a great mistake to suppose that the general character of mr coleridge s conversation was abstruse or rhapsodical the contents of the following pages may i think be taken as pretty strong presumptive evidence that his ordinary manner was plain and direct enough and even when as sometimes happened he seemed to ramble from the road and to lose himself in a wilderness of digressions the truth was that at that very time he was working out his fore known conclusion through an almost miraculous logic the difficulty of which consisted precisely in the very fact of its minuteness and universality he took so large a scope that if he was interrupted before he got to the end he appeared to have been talking without an object although perhaps a few steps more would have brought you to a point a retrospect from which would show you the pertinence of all he had been saying i have heard persons complain that they could get no answer to a question from coleridge the truth is he answered or meant to answer so fully that the querist should have no second question to ask in nine cases out of ten he saw the question was short or misdirected and knew that a mere yes or no answer could not embrace the truth that is the whole truth and might very probably by implication convey error hence that exhaustive cyclical mode of discoursing in which he frequently indulged unfit indeed for a dinner table and too long breathed for the patience of a chance visiter but which to those who knew for what they came was the object of their profoundest admiration as it was the source of their most valuable instruction mr coleridge s affectionate disciples learned their lessons of philosophy and criticism from his own mouth he was

is the true and only doctor he knows and tells he is the only teller of news for he was present and privy to the appearance which he describes he is a beholder of ideas and an utterer of the necessary and causal for we do not speak now of men of poetical talents or of industry and skill in metre but of the true poet i took part in a conversation the other day concerning a recent writer of lyrics a man of subtle mind whose head appeared to be a music box of delicate tunes and rhythms and whose skill and command of language we could not sufficiently praise but when the question arose whether he was not only a lyrist but a poet we were obliged to confess that he is plainly a contemporary not an eternal man he does not stand out of our low limitations like a chimborazo under the line running up from the torrid base through all the climates of the globe with belts of the herbage of every latitude on its high and mottled sides but this genius is the landscape garden of a modern house adorned with fountains and statues with well bred men and women standing and sitting in the walks and terraces we hear through all the varied music the ground tone of conventional life our poets are men of talents who sing and not the children of music the argument is secondary the finish of the verses is primary for it is not metres but a metre making argument that makes a poem a thought so passionate and alive that like the spirit of a plant or an animal it has an architecture of its own and adorns nature with a new thing the thought and the form are equal in the order of time but in the order of genesis the thought is prior to the form the poet has a new thought he has a whole new experience to unfold he will tell us how it was with him and all men will be the richer in his

harmonies and discordances of structure the bond of union of their parts and their past history he finds himself according to the received notions in a mighty maze and with at most the dimmest adumbration of a plan if he starts with any one clear conviction it is that every part of a living creature is cunningly adapted to some special use in its life has not his paley told him that that seemingly useless organ the spleen is beautifully adjusted as so much packing between the other organs and yet at the outset of his studies he finds that no adaptive reason whatsoever can be given for one half of the peculiarities of vegetable structure he also discovers rudimentary teeth which are never used in the gums of the young calf and in those of the foetal whale insects which never bite have rudimental jaws and others which never fly have rudimental wings naturally blind creatures have rudimental eyes and the halt have rudimentary limbs so again no animal or plant puts on its perfect form at once but all have to start from the same point however various the course which each has to pursue not only men and horses and cats and dogs lobsters and beetles periwinkles and mussels but even the very sponges and animalcules commence their existence under forms which are essentially undistinguishable and this is true of all the infinite variety of plants nay more all living beings march side by side along the high road of development and separate the later the more like they are like people leaving church who all go down the aisle but having reached the door some turn into the parsonage others go down the village and others part only in the next parish a man in his development runs for a little while parallel with though never passing through the form of the meanest worm then travels for a space beside the fish then journeys along with the bird and the reptile for his fellow travellers and only at last after a brief companionship with the highest of the four footed and four handed world rises into the dignity of pure manhood no competent thinker of the present day dreams of explaining these indubitable facts by the notion of the existence of unknown and undiscoverable adaptations to purpose and we would remind those who ignorant of the facts must be moved by authority that no one has asserted the incompetence of the doctrine of final causes in its application to physiology and anatomy more strongly than our own eminent anatomist professor owen who speaking of such cases says on the nature of limbs pp i think it will be obvious that the principle of final adaptations fails to satisfy all the conditions of the problem but if the doctrine of final causes will not help us to comprehend the anomalies of living structure the principle of adaptation must surely lead us to understand why certain living beings are found in certain regions of the world and not in others the palm as we know will not grow in our climate nor the oak in greenland the white bear cannot live where the tiger thrives nor vice versa and the more the natural habits of animal and vegetable species are examined the more do they seem on the whole limited to particular provinces but when we look into the facts established by the study of the geographical distribution of animals and plants it seems utterly hopeless to attempt to understand the strange and apparently capricious relations which they exhibit one would be inclined to suppose a priori that every country must be naturally peopled by those animals that are fittest to live and thrive in it and yet how on this hypothesis are we to account for the absence of cattle in the pampas of south america when those parts of the new world were discovered it is not that they were unfit for cattle for millions of cattle now run wild there and the like holds good of australia and new zealand it is a curious circumstance in fact that the animals and plants of the northern hemisphere are not only as well adapted to live in the southern hemisphere as its own autochthones but are in many cases absolutely better adapted and so overrun and extirpate the aborigines clearly therefore the species which naturally inhabit a country are not necessarily the best adapted to its climate and other conditions the inhabitants of islands are often distinct from any other known species of animal or plants witness our recent examples from the work of sir emerson tennent on ceylon and yet they have almost always a sort of general family resemblance to the animals and plants of the nearest mainland on the other hand there is hardly a species of fish shell or crab common to the opposite sides of the narrow isthmus of panama wherever we look then living nature offers us riddles of difficult solution if

though this is open to question the waiting process too is prolonged even after the warning bell had sent non voyagers ashore they had to stand for a considerable time in the rain while we cast off our moorings or went through some of those incomprehensible processes by which a leviathan steamer is moved out of dock after having made a first false move which separated us about three yards from the wharf inducing the wearied friends on shore to brighten up and smile and kiss hands and wave kerchiefs with that energy of decision which usually marks a really final farewell our steamer remained in that position for full half an hour during which period we gazed from the bulwarks and our friends gazed from under their dripping umbrellas across the now impassable gulf in mute resignation at that moment a great blessing befell us a boy let his cap drop from the wharf into the water it was an insignificant matter in itself but it acted like the little safety valve which prevents the

was fulfilling made frantic and futile efforts with a long piece of stick to recover his lost property but we did at last get under weigh and then there were some touches of real pathos i felt no disposition to note the humorous elements around when i saw that overgrown lad of apparently eighteen summers press to the side and wave his thin hands in adieu to an elderly lady on shore while tears that he could not and evidently did not care to restrain ran down his hollow cheeks he had no friend on board and was being sent to the cape for the benefit of his health so too was another young man

his wife and family a family of six or seven children in a house in gower street and things had not gone with him very well nor is it necessary to say very much of walter mackenzie who had been four years younger than his brother he had stuck to the office in spite of his wealth and as he had never married he had been a rich man during his father s lifetime and when he was quite young he had for a while shone in the world of fashion having been patronised by the mackenzie baronet and by others who thought that a clerk from somerset house with twelve thousand pounds must be a very estimable fellow he had not however shone in a very brilliant way he had gone to parties for a year or two and during those years had essayed the life of a young man about town frequenting theatres and billiard rooms and doing a few things which he should have left undone and leaving undone a few things which should not have been so left but as i have said he was weak in body as well as weak in mind early in life he became an invalid and though he kept his place in somerset house till he died the period of his shining in the fashionable world came to a speedy end now at length we will come to margaret mackenzie the sister our heroine who was eight years younger than her brother walter and twelve years younger than mr rubb s partner she had been little more than a child when her father died or i might more correctly say that though she had then reached an age which makes some girls young women it had not as yet had that effect upon her she was then nineteen but her life in her father s house had been dull and monotonous she had gone very little into company and knew very little of the ways of the world the mackenzie baronet people had not noticed her they had failed to make much of walter with his twelve thousand pounds and did not trouble themselves with margaret who had no fortune of her own the ball baronet people were at extreme variance with all her family and as a matter of course she received no countenance from them in those early days she did not receive much countenance from any one and perhaps i may say that she had not shown much claim for such countenance as is often given to young ladies by their richer relatives she was neither beautiful nor clever nor was she in any special manner made charming by any of those softnesses and graces of youth which to some girls seem to atone for a want of beauty and cleverness at the age of nineteen i may almost say that margaret mackenzie was ungainly her brown hair was rough and did not form itself into equal lengths her cheek bones were somewhat high after the manner of the mackenzies she was thin and straggling in her figure with bones larger than they should have been for purposes of youthful grace there was not wanting a certain brightness to her grey eyes but it was a brightness as to the use of which she had no early knowledge at this time her father lived at camberwell and i doubt whether the education which margaret received at miss green s establishment for young ladies in that suburb was of a kind to make up by art for that which nature had not given her this school too she left at an early age at a very early age as her age went when she was nearly sixteen her father who was then almost an old man became ill and the next three years she spent in nursing him when he died she was transferred to her younger brother s house to a house which he had taken in one of the quiet streets leading down from the strand to the river in order that he might be near his office and here for fifteen years she had lived eating his bread and nursing him till he also died and so she was alone in the world during those fifteen years her life had been very weary a moated grange in the country is bad enough for the life of any mariana but a moated grange in town is much worse her life in london had been altogether of the moated grange kind and long before her brother s death it had been very wearisome to her i will not say that she was always waiting for some one that came not or that she declared herself to be aweary or that she wished that she were dead but the mode of her life was as near that as prose may be near to poetry or truth to romance for the coming of one who as things fell out in that matter soon ceased to come at all to her she had for a while been anxious there was a young clerk then in somerset house one harry handcock by name who had visited her brother in the early days of that long sickness and harry handcock had seen beauty in those grey eyes and the straggling uneven locks had by that time settled themselves into some form of tidiness and the big joints having been covered had taken upon themselves softer womanly motions and the sister s tenderness to the brother had been appreciated harry handcock had spoken a word or two margaret being then five and twenty and harry ten years her senior harry had spoken and margaret had listened only too willingly but the sick brother upstairs had become cross and peevish such a thing should never take place with his consent and harry handcock had ceased to speak tenderly he had ceased to

stamped a quarter of a century later in our own times the british marine appears to have improved in quality as its enemies deteriorated in the year however greek met greek when of a verity came the tug of war the great change that came over the other navies of europe was merely a consequence of the revolutions which drove experienced men into exile and which by rendering armies all important

would help him very much in his work jonas carried the money into the city the next time he went and bought him a small hone to sharpen his knife a fine toothed saw and a bottle of black varnish with a little brush to put it on with he brought these things home and gave them to georgie s father and he carried them into the house and put them in a drawer that evening when georgie was at supper his father slyly put the things that jonas had bought on his table so that when he went back after supper he found them there he was very much surprised and pleased he examined them all very particularly and was especially glad to have the black varnish for now he could varnish his work and make it look much more handsome the little boxes that he made after this of a bright black outside and lined neatly with paper within were thought by the boys to be elegant he could now earn money faster and as his father insisted on having all his earnings expended for articles for georgie s own use and jonas used to help him about expending it he got at last quite a variety of implements and articles he had some wire and a little pair of pliers for bending it in all shapes and a hammer and little nails he had also a paint box and brushes and paper of various colors for lining boxes and making portfolios and pocket books and he had varnishes red green blue and black all these he kept in his drawers and shelves and made a great many ingenious things with them so georgie was a great friend of both rollo and jonas and they often used to come and see him and play with him and that was the reason that rollo knew his voice so well when he called to him from the landing when rollo was standing on the bridge as described in the beginning of this story two good friends rollo ran along to the end of the bridge clambered down to the water s edge went along the shore among the trees and shrubbery until he came to the seat where georgie was sitting georgie asked him to sit down and stay with him but rollo said he must go directly home and so georgie took his crutches and they began to walk slowly together up the garden walk where have you been rollo said georgie i have been to see my cousin james to ask him to go to the city with us to morrow are you going to the city yes uncle george gave james and i a half a dollar apiece the other day and mother is going to carry us into the city to morrow to buy something with it is jonas going with you yes said rollo he is going to drive we are going in our carryall i wish you would take some money for me then and get jonas to buy me something with it well i will said rollo what shall he buy for you o he may buy any thing he chooses yes but if you do not tell him what to buy he may buy something you have got already o jonas knows every thing i have got as well as i do just then they came up near the house and georgie asked rollo to look up at the golden pippin tree and see how full it was that is my branch said he he pointed to a large branch which came out on one side and which hung down loaded with fruit it would have broken down perhaps if there had not been a crotched pole put under it to prop it up but all the apples on your branch are not golden pippins said rollo there are some on it that are red what beautiful red apples yes said georgie father grafted that for me to make it bear rosy boys i call the red ones my rosy boys grafted said rollo how did he graft it o said georgie i do not know exactly he cut off a little branch from a rosy boy tree and stuck it on somehow and it grew and bears rosy boys still rollo thought this was very curious georgie told him he would give him an apple and that he might have his choice a pippin or a rosy boy rollo hesitated and looked at them first at one and then at another but he could not decide the rosy boys had the brightest and most beautiful color but then the pippins looked so rich and mellow that he could not choose very easily and so georgie laughed and told him he would settle the difficulty by giving him one of each so come here said he rollo and let me lean on you while i knock them down so rollo came and stood near him while georgie leaned on him and with his crutch gave a gentle tap to one of each of his kinds of apples and they fell down upon the soft grass safe and sound illustration they then went into the house and georgie gave rollo his money wrapped up in a small piece of paper and then rollo bidding him good by went out of the little white gate and walked along home the next morning soon after breakfast jonas drove the carryall up to the front door and rollo and his mother walked out to it rollo s mother took the back seat and rollo and jonas sat in front and they drove along they called at the house where james lived and found him waiting for them on the front steps with his half dollar in his hand he ran into the house to tell his mother that the carryall had come and to bid her good morning and then he came out to the gate james said rollo you may sit on the front seat with jonas if you want to james said he should like to very much and so rollo stepped over behind and sat with his mother this was kind and polite for boys all like the front seat when they are riding and rollo therefore did right to offer it to his cousin a lecture on playthings after a short time they came to a smooth and pleasant road with

because the commodity which he receives in exchange though it has cost us less would have cost him more as often as a country possesses two commodities one of which it can produce with less labour

be able to produce both the one and the other at a less expense of labour than the foreign country can produce them but not less in the same degree or might be unable to produce either except at a greater expense but not greater in the same degree on the contrary if it produces both commodities with greater facility or both with greater difficulty and greater in exactly the same degree there will be no motive to interchange if the cloth and the corn each of which required days labour in poland required each days labour in england it would follow that the cloth of days labour in england if sent to poland would be equal to the cloth of days labour in poland if exchanged for corn therefore it would exchange for the corn of only days labour but the corn of days labour in poland was supposed to be the same quantity with that of days labour in england with days labour in cloth therefore england would only get as much corn in poland as she could raise with days labour at home and she would in importing it have the cost of carriage besides in these circumstances no exchange would take place if on the other hand while the cloth produced with days labour in poland was produced with days labour in england the corn which was produced in poland with days labour could not be produced in england with less than days labour an adequate motive to exchange would immediately arise with a quantity of cloth which england produced with days labour she would be able to purchase as much corn in poland as was there produced with days labour but the quantity which was there produced with days labour would be as great as the quantity produced in england with days labour the power of poland would be reciprocal with a quantity of corn which cost her days labour equal to the quantity

equal to the produce of days labour in poland the remainder of what mr ricardo has done for the philosophical exposition of the principles of foreign trade is to shew that the truth of the propositions now recapitulated is not affected by the introduction of money as a medium of exchange the precious metals always tending to distribute themselves in such a manner throughout the commercial world that every country shall import all that it would have imported and export all that it would have exported if exchanges had taken place as in the example above supposed by barter to this branch of the subject we shall in the sequel of this essay return at present it will be more convenient that we should continue to suppose that exchanges take place by the direct trucking of one commodity against another it is established that the advantage which two countries derive from trading with each other results from the more advantageous employment which thence arises of the labour and capital for shortness let us say the labour of both jointly the circumstances are such that if each country confines itself to the production of one commodity there is a greater total return to the labour of both together and this increase of produce forms the whole of what the two countries taken together gain by the trade it is the purpose of the present essay to inquire in what proportion the increase of produce arising from the saving of labour is divided between the two countries this question was not entered into by mr ricardo whose attention was engrossed by far more important questions and who having a science to create had not time or room to occupy himself with much more than the leading principles when he had done enough to enable any one who came after him and who took the necessary pains to do all the rest he was satisfied he very rarely followed out the principles of the science into the ramifications of their consequences but we believe that to no one who has thoroughly entered into the spirit of his discoveries will even the minutiae of the science offer any difficulty but that which is constituted by the necessity of patience and circumspection in tracing principles to their results mr ricardo while intending to go no further into the question of the advantage of foreign trade than to show what it consisted of and under what circumstances it arose unguardedly expressed himself as if each of the two countries making the exchange separately gained the whole of the difference between the comparative costs of the two commodities in one country and in the other but the whole gain of both countries together consisting in the saving of labour and the saving of labour being exactly equal to the difference between the costs in the two countries of the one commodity as compared with the other the two countries taken together gain no more than this difference and if either country gains the whole of it the other country derives no advantage from the trade suppose for example that yards of broad cloth cost in england as much labour as yards of linen and in germany as much as if england sends yards of broad cloth to germany and is able to exchange them for linen according to the german cost of production sh\", \"target\": 2, \"compound\": 0.9967, \"neg\": 0.024, \"neu\": 0.888, \"pos\": 0.088}, {\"date\": 1844, \"info\":

inconsolable grief and never worn by sordid cares in mature age the rose still miraculously clung to her cheek litheness had not yet completely uncoiled itself from her waist nor smoothness unscrolled itself from her brow nor diamondness departed from her eyes so that when lit up and bediademed by ball room lights mrs glendinning still eclipsed far younger charms and had she chosen to encourage them would have been followed by a train of infatuated suitors little less young than her own son pierre but a reverential and devoted son seemed lover enough for this widow bloom and besides all this pierre when namelessly annoyed and sometimes even jealously transported by the too ardent admiration of the handsome youths who now and then caught in unintended snares seemed to entertain some insane hopes of wedding this unattainable being pierre had more than once with a playful malice openly sworn that the man gray beard or beardless who should dare to propose marriage to his mother that man would by some peremptory unrevealed agency immediately disappear from the earth this romantic filial love of pierre seemed fully returned by the triumphant maternal pride of the widow who in the clear cut lineaments and noble air of the son saw her own graces strangely translated into the opposite sex there was a striking personal resemblance between them and as the mother seemed to have long stood still in her beauty heedless of the passing years so pierre seemed to meet her half way and by a splendid precocity of form and feature almost advanced himself to that mature stand point in time where his pedestaled mother so long had stood in the playfulness of their unclouded love and with that strange license which a perfect confidence and mutual understanding at all points had long bred between them they were wont to call each other brother and sister both in public and private this was their usage nor when thrown among strangers was this mode of address ever suspected for a sportful assumption since the amaranthiness of mrs glendinning fully sustained this youthful pretension thus freely and lightsomely for mother and son flowed on the pure joined current of life but as yet the

by scenery whose uncommon loveliness was the perfect mould of a delicate and poetic mind while the popular names of its finest features appealed to the proudest patriotic and family associations of the historic line of glendinning on the meadows which sloped away from the shaded rear of the manorial mansion far to the winding river an indian battle had been fought in the earlier days of the colony and in that battle the paternal great grandfather of pierre mortally wounded had sat unhorsed on his saddle in the grass with his dying voice still cheering his men in the fray this was saddle meadows a name likewise extended to the mansion and the village far beyond these plains a day s walk for pierre rose the storied heights where in the revolutionary war his grandfather had for several months defended a rude but all important stockaded fort against the repeated combined assaults of indians tories and regulars from before that fort the gentlemanly but murderous half breed brandt had fled but had survived to dine with general glendinning in the amicable times which followed that vindictive war all the associations of saddle meadows were full of pride to pierre the glendinning

circumscribed youth did pierre glance along the background of his race little recking of that maturer and larger interior development which should forever deprive these things of their full power of pride in his soul but the breeding of pierre would have been unwisely contracted had his youth been unintermittingly passed in these rural scenes at a very early period he had begun to accompany his father and mother and afterwards his mother alone in their annual visits to the city where naturally mingling in a large and polished society pierre had insensibly formed himself in the airier graces

family of that place which is stoutly maintained to have been the model for hawthorne s visionary dwelling others have supposed that the now vanished house of the identical philip english whose blood as we have already noticed became mingled with that of the hawthornes supplied the pattern and still a third building known as the curwen mansion has been declared the only genuine establishment notwithstanding persistent popular belief the authenticity of all these must positively be denied although it is possible that isolated reminiscences of all three may have blended with the ideal image in the mind of hawthorne he it will be seen remarks in the preface alluding to himself in the third person that he trusts not to be condemned for laying out a street that infringes upon nobody s private rights and building a house of materials long in use for constructing castles in the air more than this he stated to persons still living that the house of the romance was not copied from any actual edifice but was simply a general reproduction of a style of architecture belonging to colonial days examples of which survived into the period of his youth but have since been radically modified or destroyed here as elsewhere he exercised the liberty of a creative mind to heighten the probability of his pictures without confining himself to a literal description of something he had seen while hawthorne remained at lenox and during the composition of this romance various other literary personages settled or stayed for a time in the vicinity among them herman melville whose intercourse hawthorne greatly enjoyed henry james sr doctor holmes j t headley james russell lowell edwin p whipple frederika bremer and j t fields so that there was no lack of intellectual society in

filled with golden sunshine as with wine and happy in the companionship of his wife and their three children he led a simple refined idyllic life despite the restrictions of a scanty and uncertain income a letter written by mrs hawthorne at this time to a member of her family gives incidentally a glimpse of the scene which may properly find a place here she says i delight to think that you also can look forth as i do now upon a broad valley and a fine amphitheater of hills and are about to watch the stately ceremony of the sunset from your piazza but you have not this lovely lake nor i

bridge these words now published for the first time the house of the seven gables in my opinion is better than the scarlet letter but i should not wonder if i had refined upon the principal character a little too much for popular appreciation nor if the romance of the book should be somewhat at odds with the humble and familiar scenery in which i invest it but i feel that portions of it are as good as anything i can hope to write and the publisher speaks encouragingly of its success from england especially came many warm expressions of praise a fact which mrs hawthorne in a private letter commented on as the fulfillment of a possibility which hawthorne writing in boyhood to his mother had looked forward to he had asked her if she would not like him to become an author and have his books read in england g p l preface when a writer calls his work a romance it need hardly be observed that he wishes to claim a certain latitude both as to its fashion and material which he would not have felt himself entitled to assume had he professed to be writing a novel the latter form of composition is presumed to aim at a very minute fidelity not merely to the possible but to the probable

was a subject of distaste at best more likely revulsion to the vast majority of the reading public perhaps the nature of the novel itself led him to consider publishing it anonymously although we know he was not averse to controversial subjects in his first book the macdermots of ballycloran which he thought had the best plot of all his novels the principal female character is seduced by a scoundrel and dies giving birth to an illegitimate child certainly nina was well suited for the experiment because of it s different setting and subject matter perhaps further to disguise his authorship trollope wrote nina in a style of prose that reads almost like a translation from a foreign language the experiment did not last long enough to test trollope s hypothesis mr hutton critic for the spectator recognized trollope as the author and so stated in his review trollope did not deny the accusation one cannot discuss nina balatka without addressing the question was trollope himself anti semitic a careful reading of his works does not provide a clear answer jews appear in some of his books and are referred to in others often as disreputable characters or money lenders they are seldom mentioned by his christian characters with respect probably realistically reflecting the sentiments of the classes he wrote about some of his greatest villains in his later novels melmotte in the way we live now and lopez in the prime minister are rumored to be jewish but trollope never unequivocally identifies them as jewish perhaps his christian characters expect them to be jewish because they are foreigners and villains however if one ignores the dialogue of his characters even the descriptive and editorial comments by trollope himself at first seem anti semitic he consistently uses jew as a pejorative adjective instead of jewish his descriptions of the appearance of jewish characters are usually unflattering and stereotypical even anton trendellsohn the hero of nina balatka is described as follows to those who know the outward types of his race there could be no doubt that anton trendellsohn was a very jew among jews he was certainly a handsome man not now very young having reached some year certainly in advance of thirty and his face was full of intellect he was slightly made below the middle height but was well made in every limb with small feet and hands and small ears and a well turned neck he was very dark dark as a man can be and yet show no sign of colour in his blood no white man could be more dark and swarthy than anton trendellsohn his eyes however which were quite black were very bright his jet black hair as it clustered round his ears had in it something of a curl had it been allowed to grow it would almost have hung in ringlets but it was worn very short as though its owner were jealous even of the curl anton trendellsohn was decidedly a handsome man but his eyes were somewhat too close together in his face and the bridge of his aquiline nose was not sharply cut as is mostly the case with such a nose on a christian face the olive oval face was without doubt the face of a jew and the mouth was greedy and the teeth were perfect and bright and the movement of the man s body was the movement of a jew this is not the typical description of the romantic hero of a victorian novel even so trollope s description of anton is less derogatory than his description of ezekiel brehgert a character in a later novel the way we live now he was a fat greasy man good looking in a certain degree about fifty with hair dyed black and beard and moustache dyed a dark purple colour the charm of his face consisted in a pair of very bright black eyes which were however set too near together in his face for the general delight of christians he was stout fat all over rather than corpulent and had that look of command in his face which has become common to master butchers probably by long intercourse with sheep and oxen the case for trollope being anti semitic is harder to support however when one considers the behavior of his jewish characters brehgert whose physical description above is stereotypic is one of the few characters in the way we live now whose actions are completely honorable trollope wrote novels before nina balatka only two of those contain jewish characters the first who plays a minor role in orley farm is soloman aram an attorney a victorian rumpole known for defending the accused at the old bailey his skill is needed to defend lady mason against a charge of perjury much to the distaste of her christian advisors he acts with dignity and shows great consideration for the personal comfort of lady mason during her trial the second jewish character in trollope s novels was mr hart a london tailor who runs for a seat in parliament in rachel ray this served no purpose in the plot the situation probably was included because legislation to allow jews to serve in parliament had been passed only five years before and the issue was still one of public discussion mr hart s appearance is brief he speaks only one or two lines and the reader is not told enough about him to judge his character trollope describes him thus and then the jewish hero the tailor himself came among them and astonished their minds by the ease and volubility of his speeches he did not pronounce his words with any of

own a house of her own but where is the advantage of a house of her own this is three times as large and you have never any odd humours my dear how often we shall be going to see them and they coming to see us we shall be always meeting we must begin we must go and pay wedding visit very soon my dear how am i to get so far randalls is such a distance i could not walk half so far no papa nobody thought of your walking we must go in the carriage to be sure the carriage but james will not like to put the horses to for such a little way and where are the poor horses to be while we are paying our visit they are to be put into mr weston s stable papa you know we have settled all that already we talked it all over with mr weston last night and as for james you may be very sure he will always like going to randalls because of his daughter s being housemaid there i only doubt whether he will ever take us anywhere else that was your doing papa you got hannah that good place nobody thought of hannah till you mentioned her james is so obliged to you i am very glad i did think of her it was very lucky for i would not have had poor james think himself slighted upon any account and i am sure she will make a very good servant she is a civil pretty spoken girl i have a great opinion of her whenever i see her she always curtseys and asks me how i do in a very pretty manner and when you have had her here to do needlework i observe she always turns the lock of the door the right way and never bangs it i am sure she will be an excellent servant and it will be a great comfort to poor miss taylor to have somebody about her that she is used to see whenever james goes over to see his daughter you know she will be hearing of us he will be able to tell her how we all are emma spared no exertions to maintain this happier flow of ideas and hoped by the help of backgammon to get her father tolerably through the evening and be attacked by no regrets but her own the backgammon table was placed but a visitor immediately afterwards walked in and made it unnecessary mr knightley a sensible man about seven or eight and thirty was not only a very old and intimate friend of the family but particularly connected with it as the elder brother of isabella s husband he lived about a mile from highbury was a frequent visitor and always welcome and at this time more welcome than usual as coming directly from their mutual connexions in london he had returned to a late dinner after some days absence and now walked up to hartfield to say that all were well in brunswick square it was a happy circumstance and animated mr woodhouse for some time mr knightley had a cheerful manner which always did him good and his many inquiries after poor isabella and her children were answered most satisfactorily when this was over mr woodhouse gratefully observed it is very kind of you mr knightley to come out at this late hour to call upon us i am afraid you must have had a shocking walk not at all sir it is a beautiful moonlight night and so mild that i must draw back from your great fire but you must have found it very damp and dirty i wish you may not catch cold dirty sir look at my shoes not a speck on them well that is quite surprising for we have had a vast deal of rain here it rained dreadfully hard for half an hour while we were at breakfast i wanted them to put off the wedding by the bye i have not wished you joy being pretty well aware of what sort of joy you must both be feeling i have been in no hurry with my congratulations but i hope it all went off tolerably well how did you all behave who cried most ah poor miss taylor tis a sad business poor mr and miss woodhouse if you please but i cannot possibly say poor miss taylor i have a great regard for you and emma but when it comes to the question of dependence or independence at any rate it must be better to have only one to please than two especially when one of those two is such a fanciful troublesome creature said emma playfully that is what you have in your head i know and what you would certainly say if my father were not by i believe it is very true my dear indeed said mr woodhouse with a sigh i am afraid i am sometimes very fanciful and troublesome my dearest papa you do not think i could mean you or suppose mr knightley to mean you what a horrible idea oh no i meant only myself mr knightley loves to find fault with me you know in a joke it is all a joke we always say what we like to one another mr knightley in fact was one of the few people who could see faults in emma woodhouse and the only one who ever told her of them and though this was not particularly agreeable to emma herself she knew it would be so much less so to her father that she would not have him really suspect such a circumstance as her not being thought perfect by every body emma knows i never flatter her said mr knightley but i meant no reflection on any body miss taylor has been used to have two persons to please she will now have but one the chances are that she must be a gainer\", \"target\": 1, \"compound\": 0.9976, \"neg\": 0.124, \"neu\": 0.702, \"pos\": 0.174}, {\"date\": 1849,

being fed on the flesh of walruses seals and white bears in the temperate regions the productions of the above mentioned extremes are mingled here many animals whose flesh is fit for human food live and thrive and here grows too a vast variety of nutritious fruits and roots and seeds the physical constitution of the various races of men that inhabit these regions is modified accordingly in the temperate climes men can live on vegetable food or on animal food or on both the constitution differs too in different individuals and it changes at different periods of the year some persons require more of animal and others more of vegetable food to preserve their bodily and mental powers in the best condition and each one observes a change in himself in passing from winter to summer in the summer the desire for a diet of fruits and vegetables seems to come northward with the sun and in the winter the appetite for flesh comes southward from the arctic regions with the cold when we consider the different conditions in which the different regions of the earth are placed in respect to their capacity of production for animal and vegetable food we shall see that this adjustment of the constitution of man both to the differences of climate and to the changes of the seasons is a very wise and beneficent arrangement of divine providence to confine man absolutely either to animal or vegetable food would be to depopulate a large part of the earth it results from these general facts in respect to the distribution of the supplies of animal and vegetable food for man in different latitudes that in all northern climes in our hemisphere men living in a savage state must be hunters while those that live near the equator must depend for their subsistence on fruits and roots growing wild when moreover any tribe or race of men in either of these localities take the first steps toward civilization they begin in the one case by taming animals and rearing them in flocks and herds and in the other case by saving the seeds of food producing plants and cultivating them by artificial tillage in inclosed and private fields this last is the condition of all the half civilized tribes of the tropical regions of the earth whereas the former prevails in all the northern temperate and arctic regions as far to the northward as domesticated animals can live from time immemorial the whole interior of the continent of asia has been inhabited by tribes and nations that have taken this one step in the advance toward civilization but have gone no farther they live not like the indians in north america by hunting wild beasts but by rearing and pasturing flocks and herds of animals that they have tamed these animals feed of course on grass and herbage and as grass and herbage can only grow on open ground the forests have gradually disappeared and the country has for ages consisted of great grassy plains or of smooth hill sides covered with verdure over these plains or along the river valleys wander the different tribes of which these pastoral nations are composed living in tents or in frail huts almost equally movable and driving their flocks and herds before them from one pasture ground to another according as the condition of the grass or that of the springs and streams of water may require we obtain a pretty distinct idea of the nature of this pastoral life and of the manners and customs and the domestic constitution to which it gives rise in the accounts given us in the old testament of abraham and lot and of their wanderings with their flocks and herds over the country lying between the euphrates and the mediterranean sea they lived in tents in order that they might remove their habitations the more easily from place to place in following their flocks and herds to different pasture grounds their wealth consisted almost wholly in these flocks and herds the land being almost every where common sometimes when two parties traveling together came to a fertile and well watered district their herdsmen and followers were disposed to contend for the privilege of feeding their flocks upon it and the contention would often lead to a quarrel and

single patriarch could send forth from his own domestic circle a force of several hundred armed men such a company as this when moving across the country on its way from one region of pasturage to another appeared like an immense caravan on its march and when settled at an encampment the tents formed quite a little town whenever the head of one of these wandering families died the tendency was not for the members of the community to separate but to keep together and allow the oldest son to take the father s place as chieftain and ruler this was necessary for defense as of course such

they toil for them watch over them submit to endless and most humiliating privations in their behalf and commit if commanded to do so the most inexcusable and atrocious crimes to sustain the demigods they have thus made in their lofty estate we have in the case of this persian monarchy one of the most extraordinary exhibitions the persian monarchy appears in fact even as we look back upon it from this remote distance both of space and of time as a very vast wave of human power and grandeur it swelled up among the populations of asia between the persian gulf and the caspian sea about five hundred years before christ and rolled on in undiminished magnitude and glory for many centuries it bore upon its crest the royal line of astyages and his successors cyrus was however the first of the princes whom it held up conspicuously to the admiration of the world and he rode so gracefully and gallantly on the lofty crest that mankind have given him the credit of raising and sustaining the magnificent billow on which he was borne how far we are to consider him as founding the monarchy or the monarchy as raising and illustrating him will appear more fully in the course of this narrative cotemporaneous with this persian monarchy in the east there flourished in the west the small but very efficient and vigorous republics of greece the greeks had a written character for their language which could be easily and rapidly executed while the ordinary language of the persians was scarcely written at all there was it is true in this latter nation a certain learned character which was used by the priests for their mystic records and also for certain sacred books which constituted the only national archives it was however only slowly and with difficulty that this character could be penned and when penned it was unintelligible to the great mass of the population for this reason among others the greeks wrote narratives of the great events which occurred in their day which narratives they so embellished and adorned by the picturesque lights and shades in which their genius enabled them to present the scenes and characters described as to make them universally admired while the surrounding nations produced nothing but formal governmental records not worth to the community at large the toil and labor necessary to decipher them and make them intelligible thus the greek writers became the historians not only of their own republics but also of all the nations around them and with such admirable genius and power did they fulfill this function that while the records of all other nations cotemporary with them have been almost entirely neglected and forgotten the language of the greeks has been preserved among mankind with infinite labor and toil by successive generations of scholars in every civilized nation for two thousand years solely in order that men may continue to read these tales two greek historians have given us a narrative of the events connected with the life of cyrus herodotus and xenophon these writers disagree very materially in the statements which they make and modern readers are divided in opinion on the question which to believe in order to present this question fairly to the minds of our readers we must commence this volume with some account of these two authorities whose guidance conflicting as it is furnishes all the light which we have to follow herodotus was a philosopher and scholar xenophon was a great general the one spent his life in solitary study or in visiting various countries in the pursuit of knowledge the other distinguished himself in the command of armies and in distant military expeditions which he conducted with great energy and skill they were both by birth men of wealth and high station so that they occupied from the beginning conspicuous positions in society and as they were both energetic and enterprising in character they were led each to a very romantic and adventurous career the one in his travels the other in his campaigns so that their personal history and their exploits attracted great attention even while they lived herodotus was born in the year before christ which was about fifty years after the death of the cyrus whose history forms the subject of this volume he was born in the grecian state of caria in asia minor and in the city of halicarnassus caria as may be seen from the map at the commencement of this volume was in the southwestern part of asia minor near the shores of the x gean sea herodotus became a student at a very early age it was the custom in greece at that time to give to young men of his rank a good intellectual education in other nations the training of the young men in wealthy and powerful families was confined almost exclusively to the use of arms to horsemanship to athletic feats and other such accomplishments as would give them a manly and graceful personal bearing and enable them to excel in the various

of miss taylor s article with which i entirely sympathise is supposed to be applicable to my intolerance let us have full toleration by all means upon all questions in which there is room for doubt or which cannot be distinctly proved to affect the welfare of mankind but when miss taylor has shown what basis exists for criminal legislation except the clear right of mankind not to tolerate that which is demonstrably contrary to the welfare of society i will admit that such demonstration ought only to be believed in by the curates and old women to whom she refers recent events have not weakened the conviction i expressed in a much abused speech at the london school board that ultramontanism is demonstrably the enemy of society and must be met with resistance merely passive if possible but active if necessary by the whole power of the state next in order it seems proper that i should briefly refer to my friend mr mivart s onslaught upon my criticism of mr darwin s critics himself among the number which will be found in this volume in evolution and its consequences i am accused of misrepresentation misquotation misunderstanding and numerous other negative and positive literary and scientific sins and much subtle ingenuity is expended by mr mivart in attempting to extricate himself from the position in which my exposition of the real opinions of father suarez has placed him so much more in fact has mr mivart s ingenuity impressed me than any other feature of his reply that i shall take the liberty of re stating the main issue between us and for the present leaving that issue alone to the judgment of the public footnote contemporary review january in his book on the genesis of species mr mivart after discussing the opinions of sundry catholic writers of authority among whom he especially includes st augustin st thomas aquinas and the jesuit suarez proceeds to say it is then evident that ancient and most venerable theological authorities distinctly assert derivative creation and thus their teachings harmonize with all that modern science can possibly require by the derivative creation of organic forms mr mivart understands that god created them by conferring on the material world the power to evolve them under suitable conditions footnote bunsen s outlines of the philosophy of universal history vol i p on the contrary i proved by evidence which mr mivart does not venture to impugn that suarez in his tractatus de opere sex dierum expressly rejects st augustin s and st thomas views that he vehemently advocates the literal interpretation of the account of the creation given in the book of genesis and that he treats with utter scorn the notion that the almighty could have used the language of that book unless he meant it to be taken literally mr mivart therefore either has read suarez and has totally misrepresented him a hypothesis which i hope i need hardly say i do not for a moment entertain or he has got his information at second hand and has himself been deceived but in that case it is surely an imprudence on his part to reproach me with having read suarez ad hoc and evidently without the guidance of anyone familiar with that author no doubt in the matter of guidance mr mivart has the advantage of me nevertheless the guides who supplied him with his references to suarez metaphysica while they left him in ignorance of the existence of the tractatus are guides with whose services it might be better to dispense leaders who wilfully shut their eyes being even more liable to lodge one in a ditch than blind leaders at the time when the essay on methods and results of ethnology was written i had not met with a passage in professor max m ller s last results of turanian researches which shows so appositely that the profoundest study of philology leads to conclusions respecting the relation of ethnology with philology similar to those at which i had arrived in approaching the question from the anatomist s side that i cannot refrain from quoting it footnote london april nor should we in our phonological studies either expect or desire more than general hints from physical ethnology the proper and rational connection between the two sciences is that of mutual advice and suggestion but nothing more much of the confusion of terms and indistinctness of principles both in ethnology and phonology are due to the combined study of these heterogeneous sciences ethnological race and phonological race are not commensurate except in ante historical times or perhaps at the very dawn of history with the migration of tribes their wars their colonies their conquests and alliances which if we may judge from their effects must have been much more violent in the ethnic than even in the political period of history it is impossible to imagine that race and language should continue to run parallel the physiologist should pursue his own science unconcerned about language it is further desirable to remark that the statements in this essay respecting the forms of native american crania need rectification on this point i refer the reader who is interested in the subject to my paper on the form of the cranium among the patagonians and the fuegians published in the journal of anatomy and physiology for if the problem discussed in my address to the british association in has not yet received

returned to the hall there to do their duty and have considerable fun as set forth in the rover boys in camp the boys uncle randolph rover had taken an elegant houseboat for debt this craft was located on the ohio river and in a volume called the rover boys on the river i related how sam tom and dick resolved to take a trip on the craft during their summer vacation on this outing they were accompanied by songbird powell a school chum given to the making of doggerel which he persisted in calling poetry fred garrison who had stood by the rovers through thick and thin and hans mueller a german youth who had not yet fully mastered the english language to make the trip more interesting the boys invited an old friend mrs stanhope to accompany them and also mrs laning her sister with mrs stanhope was a daughter dora who dick rover thought was the best and sweetest girl in the whole world and with mrs laning were her daughters grace and nellie warm friends of tom and sam the trip on the houseboat started well enough but soon came trouble through the underhanded work of dan baxter a big youth who had been the rovers bitter enemy ever since they had gone to putnam hall and another boy named lew flapp these young rascals ran off with the houseboat and two of the girls and it took hard work to regain the craft and come to the girls rescue lew flapp was made a prisoner and sent east to stand trial for some of his numerous misdeeds but dan baxter escaped we don t want to see any more of baxter sam had said but this wish was not to be gratified floating down the mississippi the houseboat got damaged in a big storm and had to be laid up for repairs this being so all on board decided to take a trip inland and accordingly they set out the ladies and girls by way of the railroad and the boys on horseback as already told in the rover boys on the plains this trip was full of mystery and peril dan baxter turned up most unexpectedly and our friends visited a mysterious ranch only to learn that it was a rendezvous for a band of counterfeiters through a government detective the counterfeiters were rounded up only one man sack todd escaping dan baxter also got away but later on he was traced to a big swamp where his horse was found stuck fast in the slimy ooze it was thought by some that baxter had lost his life trying to find his way through the swamp but of this the rovers were somewhat doubtful after the capture of the counterfeiters the boys and their chums had gone on to meet the ladies and the girls and had spent a full week at the ranch of a friend having the best times possible horseback riding hunting and helping to round up cattle then the whole party had gone back to the mississippi embarked on the dora as the houseboat was named and floated down the mighty stream once more this sort of thing is simply grand fred garrison had remarked as he stood on the forward deck of the craft yet an hour later he had changed his tune the houseboat had gone whirling in a bend of the stream struck a snag and hurled poor fred overboard he was hauled up by sam and dick rover and then it was ascertained that the houseboat was leaking and would have to be laid up again for repairs they had stopped at the town of shapette a small place and there they found a carpenter who promised to do what they wanted when the houseboat was laid up the captain had come to them with a letter my brother in cairo is dead said captain starr i shall have to leave you and look after his children the captain was an eccentric individual and the rovers did not like him much so they were perfectly willing to let him go they decided to look around for somebody else to manage the houseboat and in the meantime run the craft themselves with the party as cook and general housekeeper was alexander pop a colored man who had once been a waiter at putnam hall but who was now attached to the rover household the boys had expected to leave aleck as he was called in charge of

the boys were on the plains dick agreed to take him along and thus for the time being the dora had been left in the sole care of the planter after the visit to the sugar plantation the party had ridden to shapette to do a little shopping before returning to the houseboat there tom and sam had left the others to make certain that the dora was in proper trim to continue the trip down the

which we hold poverty i repeat the just and wholesome contempt though i see that some of my hearers look surprised at the expression i assure them i use it in sincerity and i should not have ventured to ask you to listen to me this evening unless i had entertained a profound respect for wealth true wealth that is to say for of course we ought to respect neither wealth nor anything else that is false of its kind and the distinction between real and false wealth is one of the points on which i shall have a few words presently to say to you but true wealth i hold as i said in great honour and sympathize for the most part with that extraordinary feeling of the present age which publicly pays this honour to riches i cannot however help noticing how extraordinary it is and how this epoch of ours differs from all bygone epochs in having no philosophical nor religious worshippers of the ragged godship of poverty in the classical ages not only there were people who voluntarily lived in tubs and who used gravely to maintain the superiority of tub life to town life but the greeks and latins seem to have looked on these eccentric and i do not scruple to say absurd people with as much respect as we do upon large capitalists and landed proprietors so that really in those days no one could be described as purse proud but only as empty purse proud and no less distinct than the honour which those curious greek people pay to their conceited poor is the disrespectful manner in which they speak of the rich so that one cannot listen long either to them or to the roman writers who imitated them without finding oneself entangled in all sorts of plausible absurdities hard upon being convinced of the uselessness of collecting that heavy yellow substance which we call gold and led generally to doubt all the most established maxims of political economy nor are matters much better in the middle ages for the greeks and romans contented themselves with mocking at rich people and constructing merry dialogues between charon and diogenes or menippus in which the ferryman and the cynic rejoiced together as they saw kings and rich men coming down to the shore of acheron in lamenting and lamentable crowds casting their crowns into the dark waters and searching sometimes in vain for the last coin out of all their treasures that could ever be of use to them but these pagan views of the matter were indulgent compared with those which were held in the middle ages when wealth seems to have been looked upon by the best men not only as contemptible but as criminal the purse round the neck is then one of the principal signs of condemnation in the pictured inferno and the spirit of poverty is reverenced with subjection of heart and faithfulness of affection like that of a loyal knight for his lady or a loyal subject for his queen and truly it requires some boldness to quit ourselves of these feelings and to confess their partiality or their error which nevertheless we are certainly bound to do for wealth is simply one of the greatest powers which can be entrusted to human hands a power not indeed to be envied because it seldom makes us happy but still less to be abdicated or despised while in these days and in this country it has become a power all the more notable in that the possessions of a rich man are not represented as they used to be by wedges of gold or coffers of jewels but by masses of men variously employed over whose bodies and minds the wealth according to its direction exercises harmful or helpful influence and becomes in that alternative mammon either of unrighteousness or of righteousness now it seemed to me that since in the name you have given to this great gathering of british pictures you recognise them as treasures that is i suppose as part and parcel of the real wealth of the country you might not be uninterested in tracing certain commercial questions connected with this particular form of wealth most persons express themselves as surprised at its quantity not having known before to what an extent good art had been accumulated in england and it will therefore i should think be held a worthy subject of consideration what are the political interests involved in such accumulations what kind of labour they represent and how this labour may in general be applied and economized so as to produce the richest results now you must have patience with me if in approaching the specialty of this subject i dwell a little on certain points of general political science already known or established for though thus as i believe established some which i shall have occasion to rest arguments on are not yet by any means universally accepted and therefore though i will not lose time in any detailed defence of them it is necessary that i should distinctly tell you in what form i receive and wish to argue from them and this the more because there may perhaps be a part of my audience who have not interested themselves in political economy as it bears on ordinary fields of labour but may yet wish to hear in what way its principles can be applied to art i shall therefore take leave to trespass on your patience with a few elementary statements in the outset and with the expression of some general principles here and there in the course of our particular inquiry to begin then with one of these necessary truisms all economy whether of states households or individuals may be defined to be the art of managing labour the world is so regulated by the laws of providence that a man s labour

beneficial influence on the advancement of natural knowledge no delusion is greater than the notion that method and industry can make up for lack of motherwit either in science or in practical life and it is strange that with his knowledge of mankind bacon should have dreamed that his or any other via inveniendi scientias would level men s wits and leave little scope for that inborn capacity which is called genius as a matter of fact bacon s via has proved hopelessly impracticable while the anticipation of nature by the invention of hypotheses based on incomplete inductions which he specially condemns has proved itself to be a most efficient indeed an indispensable instrument of scientific progress finally that transcendental alchemy the superinducement of new forms on matter which bacon declares to be the supreme aim of science has been wholly ignored by those who have created the physical knowledge of the present day even the eloquent advocacy of the chancellor brought no unmixed good to physical science it was natural enough that the man who in his better moments took all knowledge for his patrimony but in his worse sold that birthright for the mess of pottage of court favor and professional success for pomp and show should be led to attach an undue value to the practical advantages which he foresaw as roger bacon and indeed seneca had foreseen long before his time must follow in the train of the advancement of natural knowledge the burden of bacon s pleadings for science is the gathering of fruit the importance of winning solid material advantages by the investigation of nature and the desirableness of limiting the application of scientific methods of inquiry to that field sidenote hobbes sidenote descartes bacon s younger contemporary hobbes casting aside the prudent reserve of his predecessor in regard to those matters about which the crown or the church might have something to say extended scientific methods of inquiry to the phenomena of mind and the problems of social organisation while at the same time he indicated the boundary between the province of real and that of imaginary knowledge the principles of philosophy and the leviathan embody a coherent system of purely scientific thought in language which is a model of clear and vigorous english style at the same time in france a man of far greater scientific capacity than either bacon or hobbes ren descartes not only in his immortal discours de la m thode and elsewhere went down to the foundations of scientific certainty but in his principes de philosophie indicated where the goal of physical science really lay however descartes was an eminent mathematician and it would seem that the bent of his mind led him to overestimate the value of deductive reasoning from general principles as much as bacon had underestimated it the progress of physical science has been effected neither by baconians nor by cartesians as such but by men like galileo and harvey boyle and newton who would have done their work just as well if neither bacon nor descartes had ever propounded their views respecting the manner in which scientific investigation should be pursued sidenote for a time the progress without fruits the progress of science during the first century after bacon s death by means verified his sanguine prediction of the fruits which it would yield for though the revived and renewed study of nature had spread and grown to an extent which surpassed reasonable expectation the practical results the good to men s estate were at first by no means apparent sixty years after bacon s death newton had crowned the long labors of the astronomers and the physicists by coordinating the phenomena of solar motion throughout the visible universe into one vast system but the principia helped no man to either wealth or comfort descartes newton and leibnitz had opened up new worlds to the mathematician but the acquisitions of their genius enriched only man s ideal estate descartes had laid the foundations of rational cosmogony and of physiological psychology boyle had produced models of experimentation in various branches of physics and chemistry pascal and torricelli had weighed the air malpighi and grew ray and willoughby had done work of no less importance in the biological sciences but weaving and spinning were carried on with the old appliances nobody could

production of a coarse watch the middle of the eighteenth century is illustrated by a host of great names in science english french german and italian especially in the fields of chemistry geology and biology but this deepening and broadening of natural knowledge produced next to no immediate practical benefits even if at this time francis bacon could have returned to the scene of his greatness and

pirate captain than a member of parliament and we ourselves would we not rather read such a story as that of captain avery s capture of the east indian treasure ship with its beautiful princess and

nelson s battles are all mightily interesting but even in spite of their romance of splendid courage i fancy that the majority of us would rather turn back over the leaves of history to read how drake captured the spanish treasure ship in the south sea and of how he divided such a quantity of booty in the island of plate so named because of the tremendous dividend there declared that it had to be measured in quart bowls being too considerable to be counted courage and daring no matter how mad and ungodly have always a redundancy of vim and life to recommend them to the nether man that lies within us and no doubt his desperate courage his battle against the tremendous odds of all the civilized world of law and order have had much to do in making a popular hero of our friend of the black flag but it is not altogether courage and daring that endear him to our hearts there is another and perhaps a greater kinship in that lust for wealth that makes one s fancy revel more pleasantly in the story of the division of treasure in the pirate s island retreat the hiding of his godless gains somewhere in the sandy stretch of tropic beach there to remain hidden until the time should come to

eighteenth century was no sudden growth it was an evolution from the semilawful buccaneering of the sixteenth century just as buccaneering was upon its part in a certain sense an evolution from the unorganized unauthorized warfare of the tudor period for there was a deal of piratical smack in the anti spanish ventures of elizabethan days many of the adventurers of the sir francis drake school for instance actually overstepped again and again the bounds of international law entering into the realms of de facto piracy nevertheless while their doings were not recognized officially by the government the perpetrators were neither punished nor reprimanded for their excursions against spanish commerce at home or in the west indies rather were they commended and it was considered not altogether a discreditable thing for men to get rich upon the spoils taken from spanish galleons in times of nominal peace many of the most reputable citizens and merchants of london when they felt that the queen failed in her duty of pushing the fight against the great catholic power fitted out fleets upon their own account and sent them to levy good protestant war of a private nature upon the pope s anointed some of the treasures captured in such ventures were immense stupendous unbelievable for an example one can hardly credit the truth of the purchase gained by drake in the famous

to awaken their neighbours kings and their great vassals could generally read and write and understand the latin in which all records were made but few except the clergy studied at all there were schools in convents and already at paris a university was growing up for the study of theology grammar law philosophy and music the sciences which were held to form a course of education the doctors

house of paris neither hugh nor the next three kings robert henry philip were able men and they were almost helpless among the fierce nobles of their own domain and the great counts and dukes around them castles were built of huge strength and served as nests of plunderers who preyed on travellers and made war on each other grievously tormenting one another s villeins as the peasants were termed men could travel nowhere in safety and horrid ferocity and misery prevailed the first three kings were good and pious men but too weak to deal with their ruffian nobles robert called the pious was extremely devout but weak he became embroiled with the pope on account of having married bertha a lady pronounced to be within the degrees of affinity prohibited by the church he was excommunicated

the week and made churches and clerical lands places of refuge and sanctuary which often indeed protected the lawless but which also saved the weak and oppressed it was during these reigns that the papacy was beginning the great struggle for temporal power and freedom from the influence of the empire which resulted in the increased independence and power of the clergy the religious fervour which had begun with the century led to the foundation of many monasteries and to much grand church architecture in the reign of philip i william duke of normandy obtained the kingdom of england and thus

either there are four or five people here that have come to learn the language not to take lessons but to have an opportunity for conversation i was very glad to come to such a place for i had begun to realise that i was not making much progress with the french it seemed to me that i should feel ashamed to have spent two months in paris and not to have acquired more insight into the language i had always heard so much of french conversation and i found i was having no more opportunity to practise it than if i had remained at bangor in fact i used to hear a great deal more at bangor from those french canadians that came down to cut the ice than i saw i should ever hear at that hotel the lady that kept the books seemed to want so much to talk to me in english for the sake of practice too i suppose that i couldn t bear to let her know i didn t like it the chambermaid was irish and all the waiters were german so that i never heard a word of french spoken i suppose you might hear a

celebrated and in my guide book it is marked with two stars which is a sign of importance attached only to first class objects of interest but after i had been there half an hour i found i couldn t understand a single word of the play they gabbled it off so fast and they made use of such peculiar expressions i felt a good deal disappointed and troubled i was afraid i shouldn t gain all i had come for but while i was thinking it over thinking what i should do i heard two gentlemen talking behind me it was between the acts and i couldn t help listening to what they said they were talking english but i guess they were americans well said one of them it all depends on what you are after i m french that s what i m after well said the other i m after art well said the first i m after art

to cover from beyond where pittsburg is to where cincinnati is at the last point a mighty ice dam formed every winter till as the climate grew warmer and the ice thawed more and more the waters burst the dam and poured their tide down the ohio river to the mississippi while those of the northern lake rushed through the cuyahoga to lake erie and both lakes disappeared forever for the next four or five thousand years the early ohio men kept very quiet but we need not suppose for that reason that there were none our ice folk who dropped their stone axes in the river banks may have passed away with the ice age or they may have remained in ohio and begun slowly to take on some faint likeness of civilization there is nothing to prove that they went and there is nothing to prove that they staid but ohio must always have been a pleasant place to live in after the great thaw and it seems reasonable to think that the ice folk lingered in part at least and changed with the changing climate and became at last the people who left the signs of their presence in almost every part of the state those were the mound builders whose works are said to be two or three thousand years old though we cannot be very sure of that there are some who think that the mounds are only a few hundred years old and that their builders were the race of red men whom the white men found here one may think very much as one likes and i like to think that the mound builders were a very ancient people who vanished many ages before the indians came here they could not have been savages for the region where they dwelt could not have fed savages enough to heap up the multitude of their mounds each wild man needs fifty thousand acres to live upon as the wild man lives by hunting and fishing in the whole ohio country the earliest white adventurers found only two or three thousand indians at the most and the people who built those forts and temples and tombs and shaped from the earth the mighty images of their strange bird gods and reptile gods could have lived only by tilling the soil their mounds are found everywhere in the west between the alleghany mountains and the mississippi river but they are found mostly in ohio where their farms and gardens once bordered the muskingum the scioto the two miamis and our other large streams which they probably used as highways to the rivers of the southwest their forts were earthworks but they were skillfully planned with a knowledge which no savage race has shown they were real strongholds and they are so large that some of them inclose hundreds of acres within walls of earth which still rise ten and twelve feet from the ground they are on a far grander scale than the supposed temples or religious works and there are more of them than of all the other ruins except the small detached mounds which are almost numberless these from the charred bones found among the ashes in them are known to be tombs and they were probably the sepulchers of the common people whose bodies were burned the large mounds are heaped above walled chambers and in these were platforms supposed to have been altars and whole skeletons supposed to be the skeletons of priests buried there the priests are supposed to have been the chiefs of the people and to have ruled them through their superstitions but there is nothing to prove this for their laws were never put in written words or any other sign of speech in some of the mounds little figures of burnt clay have been found which may be idols and pieces of ancient pottery which may be fragments of sacred vessels and small plates of copper with marks or scratches on them which may be letters some antiquarians have tried to read these letters if they are letters and to make sense out of them but no seeker after true ohio stories can trust their interpretations the mound builders used very little stone and showed no knowledge of masonry but they built so massively out of the earth that their works have lasted to this day in many places just as they left them except for the heavy growth of trees which the first settlers found covering them and which were sometimes seven or eight hundred years old at marietta these works when the white people came were quite perfect and inclosed fifty acres on the bank of the muskingum overlooking the ohio they were in great variety of design the largest mound was included in the grounds of the present cemetery and so has been saved but the plow of the new england emigrant soon passed over the foundations of the mound builders temples at circleville the shape of their fortifications gave its name to the town which has long since hid them from sight one of them was almost perfectly round and the other nearly square the round fort was about seventy feet in diameter and was formed of two walls twenty feet high with a deep ditch between the other fort was fifty five rods square and it had no ditch seven gateways opened into it at the side and corners and it was joined to the round fort by an eighth it is forever to be regretted that these precious ancient works should have been destroyed to make place for the present town but

illinois and michigan common descendants of ebenezer the original immigrant of dolton many of these western kinsmen answered not so the magisterial bumpus who lived in boston on the water side of beacon whom likewise he had ventured to address to the indignation and disgust of his elder daughter janet why are you so proud of ebenezer she demanded once scornfully why aren t we descended from him how many generations seven said edward promptly emphasizing the last syllable janet was quick at figures she made a mental calculation well you ve got one hundred and twenty seven other ancestors of ebenezer s time haven t you edward was a little surprised he had never thought of this but his ardour for ebenezer remained undampened genealogy his own had become his religion and instead of going to church he spent his sunday mornings poring over papers of various degrees of discolouration making careful notes on the ruled block this consciousness of his descent from good american stock that had somehow been deprived of its heritage while a grievance to him was also a comfort it had a compensating side in spite of the lack of sympathy of his daughters and his wife hannah bumpus took the situation more grimly she was a logical projection in a new environment of the religious fatalism of ancestors whose god was a god of vengeance she did not concern herself as to what all this vengeance was about life was a trap into which all mortals walked sooner or later and her particular trap had a treadmill a round of household duties she kept whirling with an energy that might have made their fortunes if she had been the head of the family it is bad to be a fatalist unless one has an incontrovertible belief in one s destiny which hannah had not but she kept the little flat with its worn furniture which had known so many journeys as clean as a merchant ship of old salem and when it was scoured and dusted to her satisfaction she would sally forth to bonnaccossi s grocery and provision store on the corner to do her bargaining in competition with the italian housewives of the neighborhood she was wont indeed to pause outside for a moment her quick eye encompassing the coloured prints of red and yellow jellies cast in rounded moulds decked with slices of orange the gaudy boxes of cereals and buckwheat flour the brookfield eggs in packages significant this modern package system of an era of flats with little storage space she took in at a glance the blue lettered placard announcing the current price of butterine and walked around to the other side of the store on holmes street where the beef and bacon hung where the sidewalk stands were filled in the autumn with cranberries apples cabbages and spinach with little outer complaint she had adapted herself to the constantly lowering levels to which her husband had dropped and if she hoped that in fillmore street they had reached bottom she did not say so her unbetrayed regret was for the loss of what she would have called respectability and the giving up long ago in the little city which had been their home of the servant girl had been the first wrench until they came to hampton they had always lived in houses and her adaptation to a flat had been hard a flat without a parlour hannah bumpus regarded a parlour as necessary to a respectable family as a wedding ring to a virtuous woman janet and lise would be growing up there would be young men and no place to see them save the sidewalks the fear that haunted her came true and she never was reconciled the two girls went to the public schools and afterwards inevitably to work and it seemed to be a part of her punishment for the sins of her forefathers that she had no more control over them than if they had been boarders while she looked on helplessly they did what they pleased janet whom she never understood was almost as much a source of apprehension as lise who became part and parcel of all hannah deemed reprehensible in this new america which she refused to recognize and acknowledge as her own country to send them through the public schools had been a struggle hannah used to lie awake nights wondering what would happen if edward became sick it worried her that they never saved any money try as she would to cut the expenses down there was a limit of decency new england thrift hitherto justly celebrated was put to shame by that which the foreigners displayed and which would have delighted the souls of gentlemen of the manchester school every once in a while there rose up before her fabulous instances of this thrift of italians and jews who ignorant emigrants had entered the mills only a few years before they the bumpuses had come to hampton and were now independent property owners still rankling in hannah s memory was a day when lise had returned from school dark and mutinous with a tale of such a family one of the younger children was a classmate they live on jordan street in a house and laura has roller skates i don t see why i can t this was one of the occasions on which hannah had given vent to her indignation lise was fourteen her open rebellion was less annoying than janet s silent

tears the many tinted dawn and the blood red sunset of the french revolution and the more a man learns about the details of the revolution the greater is his admiration for mr carlyle s magnificent performance but it is dramatic presentation not social analysis a masterpiece of literature not a scientific investigation a prodigy of poetic insight not a sane and quantitative exploration of the complex processes the deep lying economical fiscal and political conditions that prepared so immense an explosion we have to remember it is true that m taine is not professing to write a history in the ordinary sense his book lies if we may use two very pompous but indispensable words partly in the region of historiography but much more in the region of sociology the study of the french revolution cannot yet be a history of the past for the french still walk per ignes suppositos and the revolution is still some way from being fully accomplished it was the disputes between the roman and the reformed churches which inspired historical research in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries it is the disputes among french parties that now inspire what professes to be historiography but what is really a sort of experimental investigation in the science of society they little know how long and weary a journey lies before them said burke who undertake to bring great masses of men into the political unity of a nation the process is still going on and a man of m taine s lively intellectual sensibility can no more escape its influences than he can escape the ingredients of the air he breathes we may add that if his work had been really historic he must inevitably have gone further back than the eighteenth century for the origins of contemporary france the very slight vague and unsubstantial chapter with which he opens his work cannot be accepted as a substitute for what the subject really demanded a serious summary however condensed and rapid of the various forces accidents deliberate lines of policy which from the breaking up of the great fiefs down to the death of lewis the fourteenth had prepared the distractions of the monarchy under lewis s descendants full of interest as it is m taine s book can hardly be described as containing much that is new or strikingly significant he develops one idea indeed which we have never before seen stated in its present form but which if it implies more than has been often advanced by previous writers in other forms cannot be accepted as true this is perhaps a point better worth discussing than any other which his book raises the rest is a very elaborate and thorough description of the structure of society of its physiognomy in manners and characteristics the privileges the burdens the daily walk and conversation of the various classes which made up the french people between the regency and the revolution m taine s method of description does not strike one as altogether happy it is a common complaint against french historians that they are too lax about their authorities and too heedless about giving us chapter and verse for their assertions m taine goes to the contrary extreme and pours his note books into his text with a steady handed profusion that is excessively fatiguing and makes the result far less effective than it would have been if all this industrious reading had been thoroughly fused and recast into a homogeneous whole it is an ungenerous trick of criticism to disparage good work by comparing it with better but the reader can scarcely help contrasting m taine s overcrowded pages with the perfect assimilation the pithy fulness the pregnant meditation of de tocqueville s book on the same subject when we attempt to reduce m taine s chapters to a body of propositions standing out in definite relief from one another yet conveying a certain unity of interpretation we soon feel how possible it is for an author to have literary clearness along with historic obscurity in another respect we are inclined to question the felicity of m taine s method it does not convey the impression of movement the steps and changes in the conflict among the organs of the old society are not marked in their order and succession the reader is not kept alive to the gradual progress of the break up of old institutions and ideas the sense of an active and ceaseless struggle extending in various stages across the century is effaced by an exclusive attention to the social details of a given phase we need the story you cannot effectively reproduce the true sense and significance of such an epoch as the eighteenth century in france without telling us however barely the tale for example of the long battle of the ecclesiastical factions and the yet more important series of battles between the judiciary and the crown if m taine s book were a piece of abstract social analysis the above remark would not be true but it is a study of the concrete facts of french life and society\",

similarly as a snowmark for the people at the farm unless that is waster lunny s grieve foddering the cattle in the snow not a living thing is visible the ghostlike hills that pen in the glen have ceased to echo to the sharp crack of the sportsman s gun so clear in the frosty air as to be a warning to every rabbit and partridge in the valley and only giant catlaw shows here and there a black ridge rearing its head at the entrance to the glen and struggling ineffectually to cast off his shroud most wintry sign of all i think as i close the window hastily is the open farm stile its poles lying embedded in the snow where they were last flung by waster lunny s herd through the still air comes from a distance a vibration as of a tuning fork a robin perhaps alighting on the wire of a

inspector fresh from oxford i wonder what he would say if he saw me to day digging myself out of the schoolhouse with the spade i now keep for the purpose in my bedroom the kail grows brittle from the

altogether passive spectator of a curious scene in natural history my feet encased in stout tackety boots i had waded down two of waster lunny s fields to the glen burn in summer the never failing larder from which with wriggling worm or garish fly i can any morning whip a savoury breakfast in the winter time the only thing in the valley that defies the ice king s chloroform i watched the water twisting black and solemn through the snow the ragged ice on its edge proof of the toughness of the struggle with the frost from which it has after all crept only half victorious a bare wild rosebush on the further bank was violently agitated and then there ran from its root a black headed rat with wings such was the general effect i was not less interested when my startled eyes divided this phenomenon into its component parts and recognized in the disturbance on the opposite bank only another fierce struggle among the hungry animals for existence they need no professor to teach them the doctrine of the survival of the fittest a weasel had gripped a water hen whit rit and beltie they are called in these parts cowering at the root of the rose bush and was being dragged down the bank by the terrified bird which made for the water as its only chance of escape in less disadvantageous circumstances the weasel would have made short work of his victim but as he only had the bird by the tail the prospects of the combatants were equalized it was the tug of war being played with a life as the stakes if i do not reach the water was the argument that went on in the heaving little breast of the one i am a dead bird if this water hen reasoned the other reaches the burn my supper vanishes with her down the sloping bank the hen had distinctly the best of it but after that came a yard of level snow and here she tugged and screamed in vain i had so far been an unobserved spectator but my sympathies were with the beltie and thinking it high time to interfere i jumped into the water the water hen gave one mighty final tug and toppled into the burn while the weasel viciously showed me his teeth and then stole slowly up the bank to the rose bush whence girning he watched me lift his

solitary in his shirt front and his coat was cut after the manner of the contemporary reveller his chin was clean shaven and his face though a good deal worn was ripe smooth shining with good cheer and of a purply bronze hue from exposure to hot suns and familiarity with the beverages of many peoples his full red lips with their humorous corners were shaded by a small black mustache and his twinkling bistre colored eyes beneath mobile black eyebrows gave cranley the air of a jester and a good fellow in manner he was familiar with a kind of deference too and reserve like a dog that is always wagging his tail and deprecating a kick thought barton grimly as he watched the other s genial advance he s going to say good night bless him thought maitland gratefully now the others will be

friends and enemies two young merton men and the freshman from new who were enjoying their christmas vacation in town and had been dining with maitland were a little disappointed in the appearance of the place they had hoped to knock mysteriously at a back door in a lane and to be shown after investigating through a loopholed wicket into a narrow staircase which again should open on halls of light full of blazing wax candles and magnificent lacqueys while a small mysterious man would point out the secret hiding room and the passages leading on to the roof or into the next house in case of a

from him or preserved a lasting appreciation of his work or cheerfully and intelligently recognised his immense force and accordingly we cannot help perceiving that generations are arising who know not byron this is not to say that he goes unread but there is a vast gulf fixed between the author whom we read with pleasure and even delight and that other to whom we turn at all moments for inspiration and encouragement and whose words and ideas spring up incessantly and animatingly within us unbidden whether we turn to him or no for no englishman now does byron hold this highest place and this is not unnatural in any way if we remember in what a different shape the revolution has now by change of circumstance and occasion come to present itself to those who are most ardent in the search after new paths an estimate of byron would be in some sort a measure of the distance that we have travelled within the last half century in our appreciation of the conditions of social change the modern rebel is at least half acquiescence he has developed a historic sense the most hearty aversion to the prolonged reign of some of the old gods does not hinder him from seeing that what are now frigid and unlovely blocks were full of vitality and light in days before the era of their petrifaction there is much less eagerness of praise or blame and much less faith in knife and cautery less confidence that new and right growth will naturally and necessarily follow upon demolition the revolution has never had that long hold on the national imagination in england either as an idol or a bugbear which is essential to keep the poet who sings it in effective harmony with new generations of readers more than this the byronic conception was as transitional and inadequate as the methods and ideas of the practical movers who were to a man left stranded in every country in europe during the period of his poetic activity a transitional and unstable movement of society inevitably fails to supply a propulsion powerful enough to make its poetic expression eternal there is no better proof of the enormous force of byron s genius than that it was able to produce so fine an expression of elements so intrinsically unfavourable to high poetry as doubt denial antagonism and weariness but this force was no guarantee for perpetuity of influence bare rebellion cannot endure and no succession of generations can continue nourishing themselves on the poetry of complaint and the idealisation of revolt if however it is impossible that byron should be all to us that he was to a former generation and if we find no direct guidance in his muse this is no reason why criticism should pass him over nor why there may not be something peculiarly valuable in the noble freedom and genuine modernism of his poetic spirit to an age that is apparently only forsaking the clerical idyll of one school for the reactionary medi valism or paganism intrinsically meaningless and issueless of another more attention is now paid to the mysteries of byron s life than to the merits of his work and criticism and morality are equally injured by the confusion between the worth of the verse he wrote and the virtue or wickedness of the life he lived the admirers of his poetry appear sensible of some obligation to be the champions of his conduct while those who have diligently gathered together the details of an accurate knowledge of the unseemliness of his conduct cannot bear to think that from this bramble men have been able to gather figs the result of the confusion has been that grave men and women have applied themselves to investigate and judge byron s private life as if the exact manner of it the more or less of his outrages upon decorum the degree of the deadness of his sense of moral responsibility were matter of minute and profound interest to all ages as if all this had anything to do with criticism proper it is right that we should know the life and manners of one whom we choose for a friend or of one who asks us to entrust him with the control of public interests in either of these two cases we need a guarantee for present and future art knows nothing of guarantees the work is before us its own warranty what is it to us whether turner had coarse orgies with the trulls of wapping we can judge his art without knowing or thinking of the artist and in the same way what are the stories of byron s libertinism to us they may have biographical interest but of critical interest hardly the least if the name of the author of manfred cain childe harold were already lost as it may be in remote times the work abides and its mark on european opinion je ne consid re les gens apr s leur mort said voltaire que par leurs ouvrages tout la reste est an anti pour

prominence of a characteristic sentiment or peculiar idea knowledge of this or that fact in his life may uncover the roots of something that strikes or unravel something that perplexes us considering the relations between a man s character and circumstance and what he produces we can from this point of view hardly know too much as to the personality of a great writer only let us recollect that this personality manifests itself outwardly in two separate forms in conduct and in literary production and that each of these manifestations is to be judged independently of the other if one of them

the medical man easier far easier down than up and you cannot move at all in time you cannot get away from the present moment my dear sir that is just where you are wrong that is just where the whole world has gone wrong we are always getting away from the present moment our mental existences which are immaterial and have no dimensions are passing along the time dimension with a uniform velocity from the cradle to the grave just as we should travel down if we began our existence fifty miles above the earth s surface but the great difficulty is this interrupted the psychologist you can move about in all directions of space but you cannot move about in time that is the germ of my great discovery but you are wrong to say that we cannot move about in time for instance if i am recalling an incident very vividly i go back to the instant of its occurrence i become absent minded as you say i jump back for a moment of course we have no means of staying back for any length of time any more than a savage or an animal has of staying six feet above the ground but a civilized man is better off than the savage in this respect he can go up against gravitation in a balloon and why should he not hope that ultimately he may be able to stop or accelerate his drift along the time dimension or even turn about and travel the other way oh this began filby is all why not said the time traveller it s against reason said filby what reason said the time traveller you can show black is white by argument said filby but you will never convince me possibly not said the time traveller but now you begin to see the object of my investigations into the geometry of four dimensions long ago i had a vague inkling of a machine to travel through time exclaimed the very young man that shall travel indifferently in any direction of space and time as the driver determines filby contented himself with laughter but i have experimental verification said the time traveller it would be remarkably convenient for the historian the psychologist suggested one might travel back and verify the accepted account of the battle of hastings for instance don t you think you would attract attention said the medical man our ancestors had no great tolerance for anachronisms one might get one s greek from the very lips of homer and plato the very young man thought in which case they would certainly plough you for the little go the german scholars have improved greek so much then there is the future said the very young man just think one might invest all one s money leave it to accumulate at interest and hurry on ahead to discover a society said i erected on a strictly communistic basis of all the wild extravagant theories began the psychologist yes so it seemed to me and so i never talked of it until experimental verification cried i you are going to verify that the experiment cried filby who was getting brain weary let s see your experiment anyhow said the psychologist though it s all humbug you know the time traveller smiled round at us then still smiling faintly and with his hands deep in his trousers pockets he walked slowly out of the room and we heard his slippers shuffling down the long passage to his laboratory the psychologist looked at us i wonder what he s got some sleight of hand trick or other said the medical man and filby tried to tell us about a conjurer he had seen at burslem but before he had finished his preface the time traveller came back and filby s anecdote collapsed the thing the time traveller held in his hand was a glittering metallic framework scarcely larger than a small clock and very delicately made there was ivory in it and some transparent crystalline substance and now i must be explicit for this that follows unless his explanation is to be accepted is an absolutely unaccountable thing he took one of the small octagonal tables that were scattered about the room and set it in front of the fire with two legs on the hearthrug on this table he placed the mechanism then he drew up a chair and sat down the only other object on the table was a small shaded lamp the bright light of which fell upon the model there were also perhaps a dozen candles about two in brass candlesticks upon the mantel and several in sconces so that the room was brilliantly illuminated i sat in a low arm chair nearest the fire and i drew this forward so as to be almost between the time traveller and the fireplace filby sat behind him looking over his shoulder the medical man and the provincial mayor watched him in profile from the right the psychologist from the left the very young man stood behind the psychologist we were all on the alert it appears incredible to me that any kind of trick however subtly conceived and however adroitly done could have been played upon us under these conditions the time traveller looked at us and then at the mechanism well said the psychologist this little affair said the time traveller resting his elbows upon the table and pressing his hands together above the apparatus is only a model it is my plan for a machine to travel through time you will notice that it looks singularly askew and that there is an odd twinkling appearance about this bar as though it was in some way unreal he pointed to the part with his finger also here is one little white lever and here is another the

interest me what little washing we might want could wait i thought but the pianette by woffenkoff sounded alluring i pictured ethelbertha playing in the evening something with a chorus in which perhaps the crew with a little training might join while our moving home bounded greyhound like over the silvery billows i took a cab and drove direct to a bucklersbury mr pertwee was an unpretentious looking gentleman who had an unostentatious office on the third floor he showed me a picture in water colours of the rogue flying before the wind the deck was at an angle of to the ocean in the picture no human beings were represented on the deck i suppose they had slipped off indeed i do not see how anyone could have kept on unless nailed i pointed out this disadvantage to the agent who however explained to me that the picture represented the rogue doubling something or other on the well known occasion of her winning the medway challenge shield mr pertwee assumed that i knew all about the event so that i did not like to ask any questions two specks near the frame of the picture which at first i had taken for moths represented it appeared the second and third winners in this celebrated race a photograph of the yacht at anchor off gravesend was less impressive but suggested more stability all answers to my inquiries being satisfactory i took the thing for a fortnight mr pertwee said it was fortunate i wanted it only for a fortnight later on i came to agree with him the time fitting in exactly with another hiring had i required it for three weeks he would have been

noble structure his work is in every way deeply interesting it includes graphic descriptions of the various emotions and is admirably illustrated it is generally admitted that his service consists chiefly in having shown the intimate relation which exists between the movements of expression and those of respiration one of the most important points small as it may at first appear is that the muscles round the eyes are involuntarily contracted during violent expiratory efforts in order to protect these delicate organs from the pressure of the blood this fact which has been fully investigated for me with the greatest kindness by professors donders of utrecht throws as we shall hereafter see a flood of light on several of the most important expressions of the human countenance the merits of sir c bell s work have been undervalued or quite ignored by several foreign writers but have been fully admitted by some for instance by m lemoine who with great justice says le livre de

latest corrections the first edition of is much inferior in merit and does not include some of his more important views de la physionomie et de la parole par albert lemoine p from reasons which will presently be assigned sir c bell did not attempt to follow out his views as far as they might have been carried he does not try to explain why different muscles are brought into action under different emotions why for instance the inner ends of the eyebrows are raised and the corners of the mouth depressed by a person suffering from grief or anxiety in m moreau edited an edition of lavater on physiognomy in which he incorporated several of his own essays containing excellent descriptions of the movements of the facial muscles together with many valuable remarks he throws however very little light on the philosophy of the subject for instance m moreau in speaking of the act of frowning that is of the contraction of the muscle called by french writers the soucilier corrigator supercilii remarks with truth cette action des sourciliers est un des symptomes les plus tranches de l expression des affections penibles ou concentrees he then adds that these muscles from their attachment and position are fitted a resserrer a concentrer les principaux traits de la face comme il convient dans toutes ces passions vraiment oppressives ou profondes dans ces affections dont le

logical interpretation the caricatures in the french shops show civilisation and particularly marianne in conflict with a huge and hugely wicked hindenburg ogre well i come back from this tour with something not so simple as that if i were to be tied down to one word for my impression of this war i should say that this war is queer it is not like anything in a really waking world but like something in a dream it hasn t exactly that clearness of light against darkness or of good against ill but it has the quality of wholesome instinct struggling under a nightmare the world is not really awake this vague appeal for explanations to all sorts of people this desire to exhibit the business to get something in the way of elucidation at present missing is extraordinarily suggestive of the efforts of the mind to wake up that will sometimes occur at a deep crisis my memory of this tour i have just made is full of puzzled looking men i have seen thousands of poilus sitting about in cafes by the roadside in tents in trenches thoughtful i have seen alpini sitting restfully and staring with speculative eyes across the mountain gulfs towards unseen and unaccountable enemies i have seen trainloads of wounded staring out of the ambulance train windows as we passed i have seen these dim intimations of questioning reflection in the strangest juxtapositions in malagasy soldiers resting

reserved compartment with his officer or so in charge passes importantly one meets a pair of eyes that seems to say perhaps you understand in which case it is a part i think of this disposition to investigate what makes everyone collect specimens of the war everywhere the souvenir forces itself upon the attention the homecoming permissionaire brings with him invariably a considerable weight of broken objects bits of shell cartridge clips helmets it is a peripatetic museum it is as if he hoped for a clue it is almost impossible i have found to escape these pieces in evidence i am the least collecting of men but i have brought home italian cartridges austrian cartridges the fuse of an austrian shell a broken italian bayonet and a note that is worth half a franc within the confines of amiens but a large heavy piece of exploded shell that had been thrust very urgently upon my attention upon the carso i contrived to lose during the temporary confusion of our party by the arrival and explosion of another prospective souvenir in our close proximity and two really very large and almost complete specimens of some species of ammonites unknown to me from the hills to the east of the

hers he dropped the cup and stared then hurriedly with flushing face he bent over to recover and refill it ex excuse me i m clumsy he managed to say and as he handed the cup to her he averted his gaze for more than a year the memory of this very girl had haunted him he had seen her twice the first time at the close of his one year of college at the university of california and the second time on the street in spokane in a glance he had recognized the strong lithe figure the sunny hair the rare golden tint of her complexion the blue eyes warm and direct and he had sustained a shock which momentarily confused him good water hey dissented anderson after drinking a second cup boy that s wet but it ain t water to drink come down in the foot hills an i ll show you my ranch s called many

and was unaware of her eyes bent steadily upon him anderson had roused to the interest of wheat and to a deeper study of the young man say dorn how old are you he asked twenty four and kurt s my first name was the reply will this farm fall to you yes if my father does not lose it hum old dorn won t lose it never fear he raises the best wheat in this section but father never owned the land we have

band was fixed by the accident that he did not belong to their generation in point of time the accident is in itself only worth calling attention to in connection with his distance from them in other and more important points than time footnote born in and respectively the years of turgot exactly bridge the interval between the ministry of the infamous dubois and the ministry of the inglorious calonne between the despair and confusion of the close of the regency and the despair and confusion of the last ten years of the monarchy in we stand on the threshold of that far resounding fiery workshop where a hundred hands wrought the cunning implements and cyclopean engines that were to serve in storming the hated citadels of superstition and injustice in we emerge from these subterranean realms into the open air to find ourselves surrounded by all the sounds and portents of imminent ruin this then is the significance of the date of turgot s birth his stock was norman and those who amuse themselves by finding a vital condition of the highest ability in antiquity of blood may quote the descent of turgot in support of their delusion his biographers speak of one togut a danish prince who walked the earth some thousand years before the christian era and of saint turgot in the eleventh century the prior of durham biographer of bede and first minister of malcolm iii of scotland we shall do well not to linger in this too dark and frigid air let us pass over togut and saint turgot and the founder of a hospital in the thirteenth century and the great great grandfather who sat as president of the norman nobles in the states general of and the grandfather who deserted arms for the toga history is hardly concerned in this solemn marshalling of shades even with michel etienne the father of turgot we have here no dealing let it suffice to say that he held high municipal office in paris and performed its duties with exceptional honour and spirit giving sumptuous f tes constructing useful public works and on one occasion jeoparding his life with a fine intrepidity that did not fail in his son in appeasing a bloody struggle between two bodies of swiss and french guards there is in the library of the british museum a folio of containing elaborate plates and letterpress descriptive of the f tes celebrated by the city of paris with michel etienne turgot as its chief officer on the occasion of the marriage of louise elizabeth of france to don philip of spain august as one contemplates these courtly sumptuosities la bruy re s famous picture recurs to the mind of far other scenes in the same gay land we see certain wild animals male and female scattered over the fields black livid all burnt by the sun bound to the earth that they dig and work with unconquerable pertinacity they have a sort of articulate voice and when they rise on their feet they show a human face in fact they are men that these violent and humiliating contrasts are eternal and inevitable is the last word of the dominant philosophy of society and one of the reasons why turgot s life is worth studying is that he felt in so pre eminent a degree the urgency of lightening the destiny of that livid wild hardly articulate ever toiling multitude the sum of the genealogical page is that turgot inherited that position which falling to worthy souls is of its nature so invaluable a family tradition of exalted courage and generous public spirit there have been noble and patriotic men who lacked this inheritance but we may be sure that even these would have fought the battle at greater advantage if a magnanimous preference for the larger interests had come to them as a matter of instinctive prejudice instead of being acquired as a matter of reason the question of titular aristocracy is not touched by this consideration for titular aristocracies postpone the larger interests to the narrow interests of their order and turgot s family was only of the secondary noblesse of the robe turgot was the third son of his father as the employments which persons of respectable family could enter were definite and stereotyped there was little room for debate as to the calling for which a youth should prepare himself arms civil administration and the church furnished the only three openings for a gentleman the effects of this rigorous adherence to artificial and exclusive rules of caste were manifestly injurious to society as such caste rules always are after a society has passed beyond a certain stage to identify the interests of the richest and most powerful class with the interests of the church of the army and of a given system of civil government was indeed to give to that class the strongest motives for leaving the existing social order undisturbed it unfortunately went too far in this direction by fostering the strongest possible motives of hostility to such modifications in these gigantic departments as changing circumstances might make needful in the breasts of the only men who could produce these modifications without a violent organic revolution such a system left too little course to spontaneity and its curse is the curse of french genius some of its evil effects were obvious and on the surface the man who should have been a soldier found himself saying mass and hearing confessions vauvenargues who was born for diplomacy or

reappearing after a blank interval to pick up his broom and say i guess so as he began sweeping again it was well for one reason that he did not state his belief too confidently hewson thought but after another interval of unknown length a rude sad girl came to tell him his coffee was waiting for him he followed her back into the still dishevelled dining room and sat down at a long table to a cup of lukewarm drink that in color and quality recalled terrible mornings of atlantic travel when he haplessly rose and descended to the dining saloon of the steamer and had a marine version of british coffee brought him by an alien table steward he remembered the pock marked nose of one alien steward and how he had questioned whether he should give the fellow six pence or a shilling seeing that apart from this tribute he should have to fee his own steward for the voyage at the same time his fancy played with the question whether that uncouth melancholy waitress had found a moment to wash her face before hurrying to fetch his coffee he amused himself by contrasting her sloven dejection with the brisk neatness of the service at st johnswort but through all he never lost the awe the sense of responsibility which he bore to the vision vouchsafed him doubtless for some reason and to some end that it behooved him to divine he found a yesterday s paper in the office of the hotel and read it till he began to drowse over it when he pulled himself up with a sharp jerk he discovered that it was now six o clock and he thought if he could walk about for an hour he might return to st johnswort and worry through the remaining hour till breakfast somehow he was still framing in his thoughts some sort of statement concerning the apparition which he should make when the largest number of guests had got together at the table with a fine question whether he should take them between the cantaloupe and the broiled chicken or wait till they had come to the corn griddle cakes which st john s cook served of a filigree perfection in homage to the good old american breakfast ideal there would be more women if he waited and he should need the sympathy and countenance of women his story would be wanting in something of its supreme effect without the electrical response of their keener nerves ii when hewson came up to the cottage he was sensible of a certain agitation in the air which was intensified to him by the sight of st john in his bare bald head and the n glig of a flannel housecoat inspecting with the gardener and one of the grooms the fallen trellis under the library window which from time to time they looked up at as they talked hewson made haste to join them through the garden gate and to say shamefacedly enough oh i m afraid i m responsible for that and he told how he must have thrown down the trellis in getting out of the window oh said st john while the two men walked away with dissatisfied grins at being foiled of their sensation we thought it was burglars i m so glad it was only you but in spite of his profession st john did not give hewson any very lively proof of his enjoyment deuced uncomfortable to have had one s guests murdered in their beds don t say anything about it please hewson the women would all fly the premises if there d been even a suspicion of burglars oh no i won t hewson willingly assented but he perceived a disappointment in st john s tone and manner and he suspected him however unjustly of having meant to give himself importance with his guests by the rumor of a burglary in the house he was a man quite capable of that hewson believed and failing it capable of pretending that he wanted the matter hushed up in the interest of others in any case he saw that it was not to st john primarily or secondarily to st john s guests that he could celebrate the fact of his apparition in the presence of st john s potential vulgarity he keenly felt his own and he recoiled from what he had imagined doing he even realized that he would have been working st john an injury by betraying his house to his guests as the scene of a supernatural incident nobody believes in ghosts but there is not one in a thousand of us who would not be uncomfortable in a haunted house or a house so reputed if hewson told what he had seen he would not only scatter st john s house party to the four winds but he would cast such a blight upon st johnswort that it would never sell for a tenth of its cost iii from that instant hewson renounced his purpose and he remained true to this renunciation in spite of the behavior of st john which might well have tempted him to a revenge in kind no one seemed to have slept late that morning several of the ladies complained that they had not slept a wink the whole night and two or three of the men owned to having waked early and not been able to hit it off again in a morning nap though it appeared that they were adepts in that sort of thing the hour of their vigils corresponded so nearly with that of hewson s apparition that he wondered if a mystical influence from it had not penetrated the whole house the adventitious facts were of such a nature that he controlled with the greater difficulty the wish to explode upon an audience so aptly prepared for it the prodigious incident which he was keeping in reserve but he did not yield even when st john carefully led up to the point through the sensation of his guests by recounting the evidences of the supposed visit of a burglar and then made his effect by suddenly turning upon hewson and saying

on his lightest word the disregard they showed for his feelings was maddening and for the first time in his life he became a prey to jealousy in its worst form it was quite clear to him that the girl had become desperately enamoured of the skipper and he racked his brain in a wild effort to discover the reason with an idea of reminding his brother in law of his position he alluded two or three

leads and i pointed down again he crossed himself and mumbled a prayer before he answered it is unholy what is unholy i enquired the village then there is a village no no no one lives there hundreds of years my curiosity was piqued but you said there was a village there was where is it now whereupon he burst out into a long story in german and english so mixed up that i could not quite understand exactly what he said but roughly i gathered that long ago hundreds of years men had died there and been buried in their graves and sounds were heard under the clay and when the graves were opened men and women were found rosy with life and their mouths red with blood and so in haste to save their lives aye and their souls and here he crossed himself those who were left fled away to other places where the living lived and the dead were dead and not not something he was evidently afraid to speak the last words as he proceeded with his narration he grew more and more excited it seemed as if his

hold them in while excitedly imploring me not to do anything so foolish i pitied the poor fellow he was deeply in earnest but all the same i could not help laughing his english was quite gone now in his anxiety he had forgotten that his only means of making me understand was to talk my language so he jabbered away in his native german it began to be a little tedious after giving the direction home i turned to go down the cross road into the valley with a despairing gesture johann turned his horses towards munich i leaned on my stick and looked after him he went slowly along the road for a while then there came over the crest of the hill a man tall and thin i could see so much in the distance when he drew near the horses they began to jump and kick about then to scream with terror johann could not hold them in they bolted down the road running away madly i watched them out of sight then looked for the stranger but i found that he too was gone with a light heart i turned down the side road through the deepening valley to which johann had objected there was not the slightest reason that i could see for his objection and i daresay i tramped for a couple of hours without thinking of time or distance and certainly without seeing a person or a house so far as the place was concerned it was desolation itself but i did not notice this particularly till on turning a bend in the road i came upon a scattered fringe of wood then i recognised that i had been impressed unconsciously by the desolation of the region through which i had passed i sat down to rest myself and began to look around it struck me that it was considerably colder than it had been at the commencement of my walk a sort of sighing sound seemed to be around me with now and then high overhead a sort of muffled roar looking upwards i noticed that great thick clouds were drifting rapidly across the sky from north to south at a great height there were signs of coming storm in some lofty stratum of the air i was a little chilly and thinking that it was the sitting still after the exercise of walking i resumed my journey the ground i passed over was now much more picturesque there were no striking objects that the eye might single out but in all there was a charm of beauty i took little heed of time and it was only when the deepening twilight forced itself upon me that i began to think of how i should find my way home the brightness of the day had gone the air was cold and the drifting of clouds high overhead was more marked they were accompanied by a sort of far away rushing sound through which seemed to come at intervals that mysterious cry which the driver had said came from a wolf for a while i hesitated i had said i would see the deserted village so on i went and presently came on a wide stretch of open country shut in by hills all around their sides were covered with trees which spread down to the plain dotting in clumps the gentler slopes and hollows which showed here

the snow began to fall i thought of the miles and miles of bleak country i had passed and then hurried on to seek the shelter of the wood in front darker and darker grew the sky and faster and heavier

might change his mind and oh dear his teeth are terrible long and sharp peter sat a little longer thinking and thinking then a bright idea popped into his head he kicked up his heels i ll do it said he i ll make a journey that s what i ll do i ll make a journey and see the great world by staying here and sitting still i m sure i ll simply grow quite ill a change of scene is what i need to be from all my trouble freed of course if peter had really stopped to think the matter over thoroughly he would have known that running away from one kind of trouble is almost sure to lead to other troubles but peter is one of those who does his thinking afterward peter is what is called impulsive that is he does things and then thinks about them later and often wishes he hadn t done them so now the minute the idea of making a journey popped into his head he made up his mind that he would do it and that was all there was to it you see peter never looks ahead if he could get rid of the trouble that bothered him now which you know was nothing but lonesomeness he wouldn t worry about the troubles he might get into later now the minute peter made up his mind to make a journey he began to feel better his lost appetite returned and the first thing he did was to eat a good meal of sweet clover let me see said he as he filled his big stomach i believe i ll visit the old pasture it s a long way off and i ve never been there but i ve heard sammy jay say that it s a very wonderful place and i don t believe it is any more dangerous than the green meadows and the green forest now that old man coyote and reddy and granny fox are all living here i ll start tonight when i am sure that old man coyote is nowhere around and i won t tell a soul where i am going so peter settled himself and tried to sleep the long day away but his mind was so full of the long journey he was going to make that he couldn t sleep much and when he did have a nap he dreamed of wonderful sights and adventures out in the great world at last he saw jolly round red mr sun drop down to his bed behind the purple hills old mother west wind came hurrying back from her day s work and gathered her children the merry little breezes into her big bag and then she too started for her home behind the purple hills a little star came out and winked at peter and then way over on the edge of the green forest he heard old man coyote laugh peter grinned that was what he had been waiting for since it meant that old man coyote was so far away that there was nothing to fear from him peter hopped out from the dear safe old briar patch looked this way and that way and then with his heart in his mouth started towards the old pasture as fast as he could go lipperty lipperty lip chapter iii hooty the owl changes his hunting grounds a full stomach makes a pleasant day an empty stomach turns the whole world gray peter rabbit hooty the owl sat on the tip top of a tall dead tree in the green forest while the black shadows crept swiftly among the trees he was talking to himself it wouldn t have done for him to have spoken aloud what he was saying to himself for then the little people in feathers and fur on whom he likes to make his dinner would have heard him and known just where he was so he said it to himself and sat so still that he looked for all the world like a part of the tree on which he was sitting what he was saying was this towhit towhoo towhit towhoo will some one tell me what to do my children have an appetite that keeps me hunting all the night and though their stomachs i may stuff they never seem to have enough towhit towhoo towhit towhoo will some one tell me what to do when it was dark enough he gave his fierce hunting call whooo hoo hoo whoo hoo now that is a terrible sound in the dark woods very terrible indeed to the little forest people because it sounds so fierce and hungry it makes them jump and shiver and that is just what hooty wants them to do for in doing it one of them is likely to make just the least scratching with his claws or to rustle a leaf if he does hooty whose ears are very very wonderful is almost sure to hear and with his great yellow eyes see him and then hooty has his dinner the very night when peter rabbit started on his journey to the old pasture hooty the owl had made up his mind that something had got to be done to get more food for those hungry babies of his up in the big hemlock tree in the darkest corner of the green forest hunting was very poor very poor indeed and hooty was at his wits end to know what he should do he had hooted and hooted in vain in the green forest and he had sailed back and forth over the green meadows like a great black shadow without seeing so much as a single mouse it s all because of old man coyote and granny and reddy fox said hooty angrily they ve spoiled the hunting yes sir that s just what they have done if i expect to feed those hungry babies of mine i must find new hunting\", \"target\": 4,

he raised his hand in dismissal and walked to the window when the lad went out he had not taken the line he meant to take but gerald often so to speak eluded him the lad had a way of hinting that they understood one another and osborn vaguely suspected that he worked upon his prejudices but he was a sportsman he had pluck and knew what the osborn traditions demanded in fact gerald might go far if he went straight then osborn thought he needed a drink and after ringing a bell he sat down by the window with the tray and glass a servant brought it was significant that he had given no order the servants knew what the bell meant when he had drained the glass he vacantly looked out boggy pasture and stony cornfields ran back from the tarn here and there a white farmstead surrounded by stunted trees stood at the hill foot farther back a waterfall seamed the rocks and yellow grass with threads of foam and then a lofty moor red with heather shut off the view the land was poor at the dale head but there was better below where the hills dropped down to the flat country and with the exception of ashness farm all was osborn s from force crag where the beck plunged from the moor to the rich bottoms round allerby mill unfortunately the estate was encumbered when he inherited it and he had paid off one mortgage by raising another he might perhaps have used other means letting his sporting rights and using economy but this would have jarred the only osborn who bothered about money was his wife and alice was parsimonious enough for both money was certainly what his agent called tight but as long as he could give his friends some shooting and a good dinner and live as an osborn ought to live he was satisfied still gerald must have his chance at woolwich and this needed thought osborn felt he would like another drink but glanced at his watch and saw that his visitors would arrive in a few minutes they were punctual and osborn got up when his agent and another man came in hayes was tall urbane and dressed with rather fastidious neatness bell was round shouldered and shabby he had a weather beaten skin gray hair and small cunning eyes osborn indicated chairs and sat down at the top of the big table he disliked business and knew the others meant to persuade him to do something he would sooner leave alone this would have been impossible had he not needed money mr bell wishes to know if his tender for the slate company s haulage is approved hayes began his traction engine is suited for the work and he is prepared to buy a trailer lurry which we would find useful in the dale mechanical transport would be a public advantage on our hilly roads it needs a good horse to bring half a load from station bell interposed t lurry would move as much in yan day as farmers carts in four osborn agreed he was not much of an economist but it was obvious that time and labor were wasted when a farmer took a few sacks of potatoes to the railway and another a sack of wool there was no difficulty about the tender because osborn was chairman of the small slate company the trouble was that the contract would help bell to carry out another plan the fellow was greedy and was getting a rather dangerous control he had already a lease of the limekilns and allerby mill but his rents were regularly paid and it was an advantage to deal with one prosperous tenant instead of several who had not his punctuality and capital the trailer would be useful if you decided to make the new terrace you thought about hayes suggested the cost of carting the gravel and the slabs for the wall would be heavy but i have no doubt mr bell would undertake the work with the trailer on very reasonable terms i might forget to send in t bill yan good turn deserves another bell remarked hayes frowned he had meant to imply something like this but bell was too blunt for all that osborn was not very fastidious and had long meant to make the terrace when funds permitted in fact he hardly saw the thing as a bribe it was rather a graceful recognition of his authority very well he said i ll sign the contract there is another matter hayes resumed mr bell is willing to take up harkness tenancy of the coal yard and seed store at the station he hopes you will grant him a long lease osborn pondered harkness had been drunken careless and often behind with his rent he had let his business fall away and it was understood that bell who managed the opposition coal yard had lent him small sums and until recently kept him on his feet this was not because bell was charitable but because if harkness came down while he had any trade left a capable rival might take his place in the meantime his customers gradually went to bell and now harkness had failed there was no business to attract a newcomer i don t know said osborn i had thought of advertising the yard and store you ll get nobody to pay what i m offering bell replied a stranger would want to see harkness books and there s nowt in them as would tempt him to pay a decent rent then with trailer going back from station i could beat him on the haulage up the dale he d niver get his money back if he bowt an engine like mine this was plausible but osborn hesitated he saw that bell wanted a monopoly and had a vague notion that he ought to protect his tenants it s sometimes an advantage to have two traders in a place he remarked a certain amount of competition is healthy i don t know if it would be an advantage to the estate and imagine you would not get a tenant to pay what bell offers hayes replied besides rival traders sometimes agree to keep up prices and competition does not always make things cheap that s one of the ridiculous arguments people who want the government to manage everything sometimes use said osborn with a scorn\",

silence for several minutes while everybody looked at everybody else in dismay the silence was broken by arnold of sewa arnold of sewa had been disappointed at not being chosen as one of the three spokesmen and he thought that if he had been so chosen all this trouble would not have occurred the fact is he said bitterly that you three have failed to do what you were sent to do i mention no names far from it but i don t mind saying that there are some people in this town who would have given a better account of themselves what you want in little matters of this sort is if i may say so tact tact that s what you want of course if you will go rushing into the governor s presence but we didn t rush said walter f rst shouting out that you want the taxes abolished but we didn t shout said walter f rst i really cannot speak if i am to be constantly interrupted said arnold of sewa severely what i say is that you ought to employ tact tact that s what you want if i had been chosen to represent the swiss people in this affair i am not saying i ought to have been mind you i merely say if i had been i should have acted rather after the following fashion walking firmly but not defiantly into the tyrant s presence i should have broken the ice with some pleasant remark about the weather the conversation once started the rest would have been easy i should have said that i hoped his excellency had enjoyed a good dinner once on the subject of food and it would have been the simplest of tasks to show him how unnecessary taxes on food were and the whole affair would have been pleasantly settled while you waited i do not imply that the swiss people would have done better to have chosen me as their representative i merely say that that is how i should have acted had they done so and arnold of sewa twirled his moustache and looked offended his friends instantly suggested that he should be allowed to try where the other three had failed and the rest of the crowd beginning to hope once more took up the cry the result was that the visitors bell of the palace was rung for the second time arnold of sewa went in and the door was banged behind him five minutes

of the salvation army in the united states in the course of which inquiry i came into contact with many of its officers and learned much of its system and methods especially with reference to emigration also i have had other opportunities of keeping in touch with the army and its developments in the spring of i was asked on behalf of general booth whether i would undertake to write for publication an account of the social work of the army in this country after some hesitation for the lack of time was a formidable obstacle to a very busy man i assented to this request the plan agreed

remains for me to assure the reader that the record is true and to the best of his belief and ability set down without fear favour or prejudice by one not unaccustomed to such tasks almost at the commencement of my labours i sought an interview with general booth thinking as i told him and his officers the salvation army is not mealy mouthed about such matters that at his age it would be well to set down his views in black and white on the whole i found him well and vigorous he complained however of the difficulty he was experiencing owing to the complete loss of sight in one eye occasioned by an accident during a motor journey and the possible deprivation of the sight of the other through cataract of the attacks that have been and are continually made upon the salvation army some of them extremely bitter general booth would say little he pointed out that he had not been in the habit of defending himself and his organization in public and was quite content that the work should speak for itself their affairs and finances had been investigated by eminent men who could not find a sixpence out of place and for the rest a balance sheet was published annually this balance sheet for the year ending september i reprint in an appendix with regard to the social work of the army which in its beginning was a purely religious body general booth said that they had been driven into it because of their sympathy with suffering they found it impossible to look upon people undergoing starvation or weighed down by sorrows and miseries that came upon them through poverty without stretching out a hand to help them on to their feet again in the same way they could not study wrongdoers and criminals and learn their secret histories which show how closely a great proportion of human sin is connected with wretched surroundings without trying to help and reform them to the best of their abilities thus it was that their social operations began increased and multiplied they contemplated not only the regeneration of the individual but also of his circumstances and were continually finding out new methods by which this might be done the army looked forward to the development of its social work on the lines of self help self management and self support whenever a new development came under consideration the question arose how is it to be financed the work they had in hand at present took all their funds one of their great underlying principles was that of the necessity of self support without which no business or undertaking could stand for long the individual must co operate in his own moral and physical redemption at the same time this system of theirs was in practice one of the difficulties with which they had to contend since it caused the benevolent to believe that the army did not need financial assistance his own view was that they ought to receive support in their work from the government as they actually did in some other countries especially did he desire to receive state aid in dealing with ascertained criminals such as was extended to them in certain parts of the world thus only a few weeks before in holland the parliament had asked the salvation army to co operate in the care of discharged prisoners and gave a grant of money for their support in java the tale was the same there they were preparing estates as homes for lepers and soon a large portion of the leper population of that land would be in their charge general booth told me the story of a celebrated danish doctor an optician who became attracted to the army and giving up his practice and position entered its service with his wife they said they wished to lead a life of real sacrifice and self denial and so after going through a training like any other

sweepers said the observer among the whispering leaves some one crossed the platform to consult the map with its ranges a blistering outbreak of white smokes rose a little beyond the large plume it

theodore was at this time about sixteen of course however being so young and his health being so infirm he could not take any active part in the administration of government but was obliged to leave every thing in the hands of his counselors and ministers of state who managed affairs as they thought proper though they acted always in theodore s name there were a great many persons who were ambitious of having a share of the power which the young czar thus left in the hands of his subordinates and among these perhaps the most ambitious of all was the princess sophia theodore s sister who was all this time shut up in the convent to which the rules and regulations of imperial etiquette consigned her she was very uneasy in this confinement and wished very much to get released thinking that if she could do so she should be able to make herself of considerable consequence in the management of public affairs so she made application to the authorities to be allowed to go to the palace to see and take care of her brother in his sickness this application was at length complied with and sophia went to the palace here she devoted herself with so much assiduity to the care of her brother watching constantly at his bedside and suffering no one to attend upon him or to give him medicines but herself that she won not only his heart but the hearts of all the nobles of the court by her seemingly disinterested sisterly affection indeed it is not by any means impossible that sophia might have been at first disinterested and sincere in her desire to minister to the wants of her brother and to solace and comfort him in his sickness but however this may have been at the outset the result was that after a time she acquired so much popularity and influence that she became quite an important personage at court she was a very talented and accomplished young woman and was possessed moreover of a strong and masculine character yet she was very agreeable and insinuating in her manners and she conversed so affably and at the same time so intelligently with all the grandees of the empire as they came by turns to visit her brother in his sick chamber that they all formed a very high estimate of her character she also obtained a great ascendency over the mind of theodore himself and this of itself very much increased her importance in the eyes of the courtiers they all began to think that if they wished to obtain any favor of the emperor it was essential that they should stand well with the princess thus every one finding how fast she was rising in influence wished to have the credit of being her earliest and most devoted friend so they all vied with each other in efforts to aid in aggrandizing her things went on in this way very prosperously for a time but at length as might have been anticipated suspicions and jealousies began to arise and after a time the elements of a party opposed to the princess began to be developed these consisted chiefly of the old nobles of the empire the heads of the great families who had been accustomed under the emperors to wield the chief power of the state these persons were naturally jealous of the ascendency which they saw that the princess was acquiring and they began to plot together in order to devise means for restricting or controlling it but besides these nobles there was another very important power at the imperial court at this time namely the army in all despotic governments it is necessary for the sovereign to have a powerful military force under his command to maintain him in his place and it is necessary for him to keep this force as separate and independent as possible from the people there was in russia at this time a very powerful body of troops which had been organized by the emperors and was maintained by them as an imperial guard the name of this body of troops was the strelitz but in order not to encumber the narrative unnecessarily with foreign words i shall call them simply the guards of course a body of troops like these organized and maintained by a despotic dynasty for the express purpose in a great measure of defending the sovereign against his subjects becomes in time a very important element of power in the state the officers form a class by themselves separate from and jealous of the nobles of the country and this state of things has often led to very serious collisions and outbreaks the guards have sometimes proved too strong for the dynasty that created them and have made their own generals the real monarchs of the country when such a state of things as this exists the government which results is called a military despotism this happened in the days of the roman empire the army which was originally formed by the regular authorities of the country and kept for a time in strict subjection to them finally became too powerful to be held any longer under control and they made their own leading general emperor for many successive reigns thus wholly subverting the republic which originally organized and maintained them it was such a military body as this which now possessed great influence and power at moscow the princess sophia knowing how important it would be to her to secure the influence of such a power upon her side paid great attention to the officers and omitted nothing in her power which was calculated to increase her

being sure of some thrilled arrest some exchange of assurance and response at every step obviously half the charm as i can but thinly describe it of the substantially continuous experience the first passages of which i thus note was in the fact that immensely moved by it as i was and having so to deal with it in the anticipatory way or to the whatevers and wherevers and whenevers within me that should find it in order i yet felt it in no degree as strange or obscure baffling or unrecognising on its own side everything was so far from impenetrable that my most general notion was the very ecstasy of understanding and that really wherever i looked and still more wherever i pressed i sank in and in up to my nose this in particular was of the perfect felicity that while the fact of difference all round me was immense the embarrassment of it was nil as if the getting into relation with the least waste had been prepared from so far back that a sort of divine economy now fairly ruled it was doubtless a part of the total fatuity and perhaps its sublimest mark that i knew what everything meant not simply then but for weeks and months after and was to know less only with increase of knowledge that must indeed have been of the essence of the general effect and the particular felicity only not grotesque because for want of occasion not immediately exhibited a

briefest moment to unveil her idea of himself i never could endure he said those meals which consist of thin shavings of bread with thick plasters of butter aided and abetted by sweet cakes preserves and tea you should have reserved those remarks she said until you had found out what sort of evening meal we have he could certainly say something he thought perhaps it might be some little fanciful story which would call up in her mind without his appearing to intend it some thought of his relationship to her as a lover that is if she had ever had such a notion if this could be done her face would betray the fact but not being ready to make such a remark he said i beg your pardon but do you really have suppers in the english fashion oh no answered miss roberta we don t have a great cold joint with old cheese and pitchers of brown stout and ale but neither do we content ourselves with thin bread and butter and preserves we have coffee as well as tea hot rolls fleecy and light hot batter bread made of our finest corn meal hot biscuits and stewed fruit with plenty of sweet milk and buttermilk and if anybody wants it he can always have a slice of cold ham if i could only feel sure thought mr croft that she looked upon me merely as an acquaintance i would cease to trouble my mind on this subject and let everything go on as before but i am not sure and i would rather not come here again until i am and at what hour he asked do you partake of a meal like that in summer time said miss roberta we have supper when it is dark enough to light the lamps my uncle dislikes very much to be deprived by the advent of a meal of the out door enjoyment of a late afternoon or as we call it down here the evening it would be easy enough thought mr croft for me to say something about my being suddenly obliged to go away and then notice its effect upon her but apart from the fact that i would not do anything so vulgar and commonplace it would not advantage me in the slightest degree she would see through the flimsiness of my purpose and no matter how she looked upon me would show nothing but a well bred regret that i should be obliged to go away at such a pleasant season i think the hour for your supper said he is a very suitable one but i am not sure that such a variety of hot bread would agree with me did you ever see more healthy looking ladies and gentlemen than you find in virginia asked miss march it is not that i want to know if she looks favorably upon me said lawrence croft to himself for when i wish to discover that i shall simply ask her what i wish now to know is whether or not she considers me at all as a lover there surely must be something i can say which will give me a clew the virginians as a rule he replied are certainly a very well grown and vigorous race in spite of the hot bread she said with a smile just then mr croft believed himself struck by a happy thought\", \"target\": 2, \"compound\": 0.9988, \"neg\": 0.052, \"neu\": 0.813,

accepted his work morality of course i want work i bluffed don t believe it he snorted try me i answered warming to the bluff all right he said come to the corner of blank and blank streets i have forgotten the address to morrow morning you know where that burned building is and i ll put you to work tossing bricks all right sir i ll be there he grunted and went on eating i waited after a couple of minutes he looked up with an i thought you were gone expression on his face and demanded well i i am waiting for something to eat i said gently i knew you wouldn t work he roared he was right of course but his conclusion must have been reached by mind reading for his logic wouldn t bear it out but the beggar at the door must be humble so i accepted his logic as i had accepted his morality you see i am now hungry i said still gently to morrow morning i shall be hungrier think how hungry i shall be when i have tossed bricks all day without anything to eat now if you will give me something to eat i ll be in great shape for those bricks he gravely considered my plea at the same time going on eating while his wife nearly trembled into propitiatory speech but refrained i ll tell you what i ll do he said between mouthfuls you come to work to morrow and in the middle of the day i ll advance you enough for your dinner that will show whether you are in earnest or not in the meantime i began but he interrupted if i gave you something to eat now i d never see you again oh i know your kind look at me i owe no man i have never descended so low as to ask any one for food i have always earned my food the trouble with you is that you are idle and dissolute i can see it in your face i have worked and been honest i have made myself what i am and you can do the same if you work and are honest like you i queried alas no ray of humor had ever penetrated the sombre work sodden soul of that man yes like me he answered all of us i queried yes all of you he answered conviction vibrating in his voice but if we all became like you i said allow me to point out that there d be nobody to toss bricks for you i swear there was a flicker of a smile in his wife s eye as for him he was aghast but whether at the awful possibility of a reformed humanity that would not enable him to get anybody to toss bricks for him or at my impudence i shall never know i ll not waste words on you he roared get out of here you ungrateful whelp i scraped my feet to advertise my intention of going and queried and i don t get anything to eat he arose suddenly to his feet he was a large man i was a stranger in a strange land and john law was looking for me i went away hurriedly but why ungrateful i asked myself as i slammed his gate what in the dickens did he give me to be ungrateful about i looked back i could still see him through the window he had returned to his pie by this time i had lost heart i passed many houses by without venturing up to them all houses looked alike and none looked good after walking half a dozen blocks i shook off my despondency and gathered my nerve this begging for food was all a game and if i didn t like the cards i could always call for a new deal i made up my mind to tackle the next house i approached it in the deepening twilight going around to the kitchen door i knocked softly and when i saw the kind face of the middle aged woman who answered as by inspiration came to me the story i was to tell for know that upon his ability to tell a good story depends the success of the beggar first of all and on the instant the beggar must size up his victim after that he must tell a story that will appeal to the peculiar personality and temperament of that particular victim and right here arises the great difficulty in the instant that he is sizing up the victim he must begin his story not a minute is allowed for preparation as in a lightning flash he must divine the nature of the victim and conceive a tale that will hit home the successful hobo must be an artist he must create spontaneously and instantaneously and not upon a theme selected from the plenitude of his own imagination but upon the theme he reads in the face of the person who opens the door be it man woman or child sweet or crabbed generous or miserly good natured or cantankerous jew or gentile black or white race prejudiced or brotherly provincial or universal or whatever else it may be i have often thought that to this training of my tramp days is due much of my success as a story writer in order to get the food whereby i lived i was compelled to tell tales that rang true at the back door out of inexorable necessity is developed the convincingness and sincerity laid down by all authorities on the art of the short story also i quite believe it was my tramp apprenticeship that made a realist out of me realism constitutes the only goods one can exchange at the kitchen door for grub after all art is only consummate artfulness and artfulness saves many a story i remember lying in a police station at winnipeg manitoba i was bound west over the canadian pacific of course the police wanted my story and i gave it to them on the spur of the moment they were landlubbers in the

like other slave owners a politician he was naturally an original secessionist and ardently devoted to the southern cause circumstances of an imperious nature which it is unnecessary to relate here had prevented him from taking service with that gallant army which had fought the disastrous campaigns ending with the fall of corinth and he chafed under the inglorious restraint longing for the release of his energies the larger life of the soldier the opportunity for distinction that opportunity he felt would come as it comes to all in wartime meanwhile he did what he could no service was too humble for him to perform in the aid of the south no adventure to perilous for him to undertake if consistent with the character of a civilian who was at heart a soldier and who in good faith and without too much qualification assented to at least a part of the frankly villainous dictum that all is fair in love and war one evening while farquhar and his wife were sitting on a rustic bench near the entrance to his grounds a gray clad soldier rode up to the gate and asked for a drink of water mrs farquhar was only too happy to serve him with her own white hands while she was fetching the water her husband approached the dusty horseman and inquired eagerly for news from the front the yanks are repairing the railroads said the man and are getting ready for another advance they have reached the owl creek bridge put it in order and built a stockade on the north bank the commandant has issued an order which is posted everywhere declaring that any civilian caught interfering with the railroad its bridges tunnels or trains will be summarily hanged i saw the order how far is it to the owl creek bridge farquhar asked about thirty miles is there no force on this side of the creek only a picket post half a mile out on the railroad and a single sentinel at this end of the bridge suppose a man a civilian and student of hanging should elude the picket post and perhaps get the better of the sentinel said farquhar smiling what could he accomplish the soldier reflected i was there a month ago he replied i observed that the flood of last winter had lodged a great quantity of driftwood against the wooden pier at this end of the bridge it is now dry and would burn like tinder the lady had now brought the water which the soldier drank he thanked her ceremoniously bowed to her husband and rode away an hour later after nightfall he repassed the plantation going northward in the direction from which he had come he was a federal scout iii as peyton farquhar fell straight downward through the bridge he lost consciousness and was as one already dead from this state he was awakened ages later it seemed to him by the pain of a sharp pressure upon his throat followed by a sense of suffocation keen poignant agonies seemed to shoot from his neck downward through every fiber of his body and limbs these pains appeared to flash along well defined lines of ramification and to beat with an inconceivably rapid periodicity they seemed like streams of pulsating fire heating him to an intolerable temperature as to his head he was conscious of nothing but a feeling of fullness of congestion these sensations were unaccompanied by thought the intellectual part of his nature was already effaced he had power only to feel and feeling was torment he was conscious of motion encompassed in a luminous cloud of which he was now merely the fiery heart without material substance he swung through unthinkable arcs of oscillation like a vast pendulum then all at once with terrible suddenness the light about him shot upward with the noise of a loud splash a frightful roaring was in his ears and all was cold and dark the power of thought was restored he knew that the rope had broken and he had fallen into the stream there was no additional strangulation the noose about his neck was already suffocating him and kept the water from his lungs to die of hanging at the bottom of a river the idea seemed to him ludicrous he opened his eyes in the darkness and saw above him a gleam of light but how distant how inaccessible he was still sinking for the light became fainter and fainter until it was a mere glimmer then it began to grow and brighten and he knew that he was rising toward the surface knew it with reluctance for he was now very comfortable to be

just been telegraphed for to go to beaulieu my mother is very ill what is the matter with her he asked and she replied inflammation of the lungs but i must stop i can t speak any more then came some sobs and silence that same afternoon by mary s direction the aerophone was brought back to him in a dog cart and three days later he heard that her mother mrs porson was dead some months passed and when they met again on her return from the riviera morris found his cousin changed she had parted from him a child and now beneath the shadow of the wings of grief suddenly she had become a woman moreover the best and frankest part of their intimacy seemed to have vanished there was a veil between them mary thought of little and at this time seemed to care for no one except her mother who was

experiments followed at intervals most of which were fiascos although some were partially successful thus at times mary could hear what he said but except for a word or two and now and then a sentence

he raved and stormed and nearly smashed the patent receiver in his fury to a scientific man let it be admitted it was nothing short of maddening to be told that the successful working of his instrument to the manufacture of which he had given eight years of toil and study depended upon some pre existent sympathy between the operators of its divided halves if that were so what was the use of his wonderful discovery for who could ensure a sympathetic correspondent and yet the fact remained that when in their playmate days he understood his cousin mary and when her quiet indolent nature had been deeply moved by the shock of the news of her mother s peril the aerophone had worked whereas now when she had become a grown up young lady he did not understand her any longer he whose heart was wrapped up in his experiments and who by nature feared the adult members of her sex and shrank from them when too her placid calm was no longer stirred work it would not she laughed at his temper

little boat i need say but little more in regard to this shipwreck when the fog lifted about ten o clock in the morning we could see no signs of any of the boats a mile or so away lay the dull black line of the derelict as if she were some savage beast who had bitten and torn us and was now sullenly waiting to see us die of the wound we hoisted a flag union down and then we went below to get some breakfast mr crowder knew all about the ship and where to find everything he told me he had made so many voyages that he felt almost as much at home on sea as on land we made ourselves comfortable all day and at night we went to our rooms and i slept fairly well although there was a very disagreeable slant to my berth the next day early in the afternoon our signal of distress was seen by a tramp steamer on her way to new york and we were taken off we cruised about for many hours in the direction the boats had probably taken and the next day we picked up two of them in a sorry condition the occupants having suffered many hardships and privations we never had news of the captain s boat but the others were rescued by a sailing vessel going eastward before we reached new york mr crowder had made me promise that i would spend a few days with him at his home in that city his family was small he told me a wife and a daughter about six and he wanted me to know them naturally we had become great friends very likely the man had saved my life and he had done it without any act of heroism or daring but simply by impressing me with the fact that his judgment was better than mine i am apt to

written news has arrived from america that a leading new york newspaper which was among the most abusively clamorous for the suppression of mrs warren s profession has just been fined heavily for deriving part of its revenue from advertisements of mrs warren s houses many people have been puzzled by the fact that whilst stage entertainments which are frankly meant to act on the spectators as aphrodisiacs are everywhere tolerated plays which have an almost horrifyingly contrary effect are fiercely attacked by persons and papers notoriously indifferent to public morals on all other occasions the explanation is very simple the profits of mrs warren s profession are shared not only by mrs warren and sir george crofts but by the landlords of their houses the newspapers which advertize them the restaurants which cater for them and in short all the trades to which they are good customers not to mention the public officials and representatives whom they silence by complicity corruption or blackmail add to these the employers who profit by cheap female labor and the shareholders whose dividends depend on it you find such people everywhere even on the judicial bench and in the highest places in church and state and you get a large and powerful class with a strong pecuniary incentive to protect mrs warren s profession and a correspondingly strong incentive to conceal from their own consciences no less than from the world the real sources of their gain these are the people who declare that it is feminine vice and not poverty that drives women to the streets as if vicious women with independent incomes ever went there these are the people who indulgent or indifferent to aphrodisiac plays raise the moral hue and cry against performances of mrs warren s profession and drag actresses to the police court to be insulted bullied and threatened for fulfilling their engagements for please observe that the judicial decision in new york state in favor of the play does not end the matter in kansas city for instance the municipality finding itself restrained by the courts from preventing the performance fell back on a local bye law against indecency to evade the constitution of the united states they summoned the actress who impersonated mrs warren to the police court and offered her and her colleagues the alternative of leaving the city or being prosecuted under this bye law now nothing is more possible than that the city councillors who suddenly displayed such concern for the morals of the theatre were either mrs warren s landlords or employers of women at starvation wages or restaurant keepers or newspaper proprietors or in some other more or less direct way sharers of the profits of her trade no doubt it is equally possible that they were simply stupid men who thought that indecency consists not in evil but in mentioning it i have however been myself a member of a municipal council and have not found municipal councillors quite so simple and inexperienced as this at all events i do not propose to give the kansas councillors the benefit of the doubt i therefore advise the public at large which will finally decide the matter to keep a vigilant eye on gentlemen who will stand anything at the theatre except a performance of mrs warren s profession and who assert in the same breath that a the play is too loathsome to be bearable by civilized people and b that unless its performance is prohibited the whole town will throng to see it they may be merely excited and foolish but i am bound to warn the public that it is equally likely that they may be collected and knavish at all events to prohibit the play is to protect the evil which the play exposes and in view of that fact i see no reason for assuming that the prohibitionists are disinterested moralists and that the author the managers and the performers who depend for their livelihood on their personal reputations and not on rents advertisements or dividends are grossly inferior to them in moral sense and public responsibility it is true that in mrs warren s profession society and not any individual is the villain of the piece but it does not

not live a week perhaps not a day she lies there alone in the garden of the hospital and she is afraid there are none who knew her whom she cares for to take her into their arms and to bid her have no

first interview was in monastier market place to prove her good temper one child after another was set upon her back to ride and one after another went head over heels into the air until a want of confidence began to reign in youthful bosoms and the experiment was discontinued from a dearth of subjects i was already backed by a deputation of my friends but as if this were not enough all the buyers and sellers came round and helped me in the bargain and the ass and i and father adam were the centre of a hubbub for near half an hour at length she passed into my service for the consideration of sixty five francs and a glass of brandy the sack had already cost eighty francs and two glasses of beer so that modestine as i instantly baptized her was upon all accounts the cheaper article indeed that was as it should be for she was only an appurtenance of my mattress or self acting bedstead on four castors i had a last interview with father adam in a billiard room at the witching hour of dawn when i administered the brandy he professed himself greatly touched by the separation and declared he had often bought white bread for the donkey when he had been content with black bread for himself but this according to the best authorities must have been a flight of fancy he had a name in the village for brutally misusing the ass yet it is certain that he shed a tear and the tear made a clean mark down one cheek by the advice of a fallacious local saddler a leather pad was made for me with rings to fasten on my bundle and i thoughtfully completed my kit and arranged my toilette by way of armoury and utensils i took a revolver a little spirit lamp and pan a lantern and some halfpenny candles a jack knife and a large leather flask the main cargo consisted of two entire changes of warm clothing besides my travelling wear of country velveteen pilot coat and knitted spencer some books and my railway rug which being also in the form of a bag made me a double castle for cold nights the permanent larder was represented by cakes of chocolate and tins of bologna sausage all this except what i carried about my person was easily stowed into the sheepskin bag and by good fortune i threw in my empty knapsack rather for convenience of carriage than from any thought that i should want it on my journey for more immediate needs i took a leg of cold mutton a

every roadside and a man soon learns the art of correcting any tendency to overbalance with a well adjusted stone on the day of my departure i was up a little after five by six we began to load the donkey and ten minutes after my hopes were in the dust the pad would not stay on modestine s back for half a moment i returned it to its maker with whom i had so contumelious a passage that the street outside was crowded from wall to wall with gossips looking on and listening the pad changed hands with much vivacity perhaps it would be more descriptive to say that we threw it at each other s heads and at any rate we were very warm and unfriendly and spoke with a deal of freedom i had a common donkey pack saddle a barde as they call it fitted upon modestine and once more loaded her with my

corded together in a very elaborate system of knots and i looked on the result with fatuous content in such a monstrous deck cargo all poised above the donkey s shoulders with nothing below to balance on a brand new pack saddle that had not yet been worn to fit the animal and fastened with brand new girths that might be expected to stretch and slacken by the way even a very careless traveller should have seen disaster brewing that elaborate system of knots again was the work of too many sympathisers to be very artfully designed it is true they tightened the cords with a will as many as three at a time would have a foot against modestine s quarters and be hauling with clenched teeth but i learned afterwards that one thoughtful person without any exercise of force can make a more

restrain his waywardness stood a boy a street boy a city arab to a londoner any description of this boy would be superfluous but it may be well to state for the benefit of the world at large that the class to which he belonged embodies within its pale the quintessence of rollicking mischief and the sublimate of consummate insolence this remarkable boy was afflicted with a species of dance not that of saint vitus but a sort of double shuffle with a stamp of the right foot at the end in which he was prone to indulge consciously and unconsciously at all times and the tendency to which he sometimes found it difficult to resist he was beginning to hum the sharply defined air to which he was in the habit of performing this dance when little diana said in a silvery voice quite in keeping with her beauty let go his head boy i m quite sure that he cannot bear restraint it may be remarked here that little di was probably a good judge on that point being herself nearly incapable of bearing restraint i d better not miss replied the boy with profound respect in tone and manner for he had yet to be paid for the job he seems raither frisky an might take a fancy to bolt you know let his head go i say returned miss diana with a flashing of the blue eyes and a pursing of the rosebud mouth that proved her to be one of adam s race after all vell now don t you think rejoined the boy in an expostulating tone that it would be as veil to vait for the guv nor before givin im is ead do as i bid you sir said di drawing herself up like an empress still the street boy held the pony s head and it is probable that he would have come off the victor in this controversy had not diana s dignified action given to the reins which she held a jerk the brown pony deeming this full permission to go on went off with a bound that overturned the boy and caused the fore wheel to strike him on the leg as it passed springing up with the intention of giving chase to the runaway the little fellow again fell with a sharp cry of pain for his leg was broken at the same moment sir richard brandon issued from the door of his mansion leisurely and with an air of calm serenity pulling on his gloves it was one of the knight s maxims that under all circumstances a gentleman should maintain an appearance of imperturbable serenity when however he suddenly beheld the street boy falling and his daughter standing up in her wickerwork chariot holding on to the brown pony like an amazon warrior of ancient times his maxim somehow evaporated his serenity vanished so did his hat as he bounded from beneath it and left it far behind in his mad and hopeless career after the runaway a policeman coming up just as sir richard disappeared went to the assistance of the street boy not much hurt youngster he said kindly as he observed that the boy was very pale and seemed to be struggling hard to repress his feelings vell p raps i is an p raps i ain t bobby replied the boy with an unsuccessful attempt at a smile for he felt safe to chaff or insult his foe in the circumstances but vether hurt or not it vont much matter to you vill it he fainted as he spoke and the look of half humorous impudence as well as that of pain gave place to an expression of infantine repose the policeman was so struck by the unusual sight of a street boy looking innocent and unconscious that he stooped and raised him quite tenderly in his arms you d better carry him in here said sir richard brandon s butler who had come out i saw it appen and suspect he must be a good deal damaged sir richard s footman backing the invitation the boy was carried into the house accordingly laid on the housemaid s bed and attended to by the cook while the policeman went out to look after the runaways oh what ever shall we do

most efficient indeed an indispensable instrument of scientific progress finally that transcendental alchemy the superinducement of new forms on matter which bacon declares to be the supreme aim of science has been wholly ignored by those who have created the physical knowledge of the present day even the eloquent advocacy of the chancellor brought no unmixed good to physical science it was natural enough that the man who in his better moments took all knowledge for his patrimony but in his worse sold that birthright for the mess of pottage of court favor and professional success for pomp and show should be led to attach an undue value to the practical advantages which he foresaw as roger bacon and indeed seneca had foreseen long before his time must follow in the train of the advancement of natural knowledge the burden of bacon s pleadings for science is the gathering of fruit the importance of winning solid material advantages by the investigation of nature and the desirableness of limiting the application of scientific methods of inquiry to that field sidenote hobbes sidenote descartes bacon s younger contemporary hobbes casting aside the prudent reserve of his predecessor in regard to those matters about which the crown or the church might have something to say extended scientific methods of inquiry to the phenomena of mind and the problems of social

really lay however descartes was an eminent mathematician and it would seem that the bent of his mind led him to overestimate the value of deductive reasoning from general principles as much as bacon had underestimated it the progress of physical science has been effected neither by baconians nor by cartesians as such but by men like galileo and harvey boyle and newton who would have done their work just as well if neither bacon nor descartes had ever propounded their views respecting the manner in which scientific investigation should be pursued sidenote for a time the progress without

mother told him a story that her own mother had told to her when she herself was younger than little ernest a story not of things that were past but of what was yet to come a story nevertheless so very old that even the indians who formerly inhabited this valley had heard it from their forefathers to whom as they affirmed it had been murmured by the mountain streams and whispered by the wind among the tree tops the purport was that at some future day a child should be born hereabouts who was destined to become the greatest and noblest personage of his time and whose countenance in manhood should bear an exact resemblance to the great stone face not a few old fashioned people and young ones likewise in the ardor of their hopes still cherished an enduring faith in this old prophecy but others who had seen more of the world had watched and waited till they were weary and had beheld no man with such a face nor any man that proved to be much greater or nobler than his neighbors concluded it to be nothing but an idle tale at all events the great man of the prophecy had not yet appeared o mother dear mother cried ernest clapping his hands above his head i do hope that i shall live to see him his mother was an affectionate and thoughtful woman and felt that it was wisest not to discourage the generous hopes of her little boy so she only said to him perhaps you may and ernest never forgot the story that his mother told him it was always in his mind whenever he looked upon the great stone face he spent his childhood in the log cottage where he was born and was dutiful to his mother and helpful to her in many things assisting her much with his little hands and more with his loving heart in this manner from a happy yet often pensive child he grew up to be a mild quiet unobtrusive boy and sun browned with labor in the fields but with more intelligence brightening his aspect than is seen in many lads who have been taught at famous schools yet ernest had had no teacher save only that the great stone face became one to him when the toil of the day was over he would gaze at it for hours until he began to imagine that those vast features recognized him and gave him a smile of kindness and encouragement responsive to his own look of veneration we must not take upon us to affirm that this was a mistake although the face may have looked no more kindly at ernest than at all the world besides but the secret was that the boy s tender and confiding simplicity discerned what other people could not see and thus the love which was meant for all became his peculiar portion about this time there went a rumor throughout the valley that the great man foretold from ages long ago who was to bear a resemblance to the great stone face had appeared at last it seems that many years before a young man had migrated from the valley and settled at a distant seaport where after getting together a little money he had set up as a shopkeeper his name but i could never learn whether it was his real one or a nickname that had grown out of his habits and success in life was gathergold being shrewd and active and endowed by providence with that inscrutable faculty which develops itself in what the world calls luck he became an exceedingly rich merchant and owner of a whole fleet of bulky bottomed ships all the countries of the globe appeared to join hands for the mere purpose of adding heap after heap to the mountainous accumulation of this one man s wealth the cold regions of the north almost within the gloom and shadow of the arctic circle sent him their tribute in the shape of furs hot africa sifted for him the golden sands of her rivers and gathered up the ivory tusks of her great elephants out of the forests the east came bringing him the rich shawls and spices and teas and the effulgence of diamonds and the gleaming purity of large pearls the ocean not to be behindhand with the earth yielded up her mighty whales that mr gathergold might sell their oil and make a profit on it be the original commodity what it might it was gold within his grasp it might be said of him as of midas in the fable that whatever he touched with his finger immediately glistened and grew yellow and was changed at once into sterling metal or which suited him still better into piles of coin and when mr gathergold had become so very rich that it would have taken him a hundred years only to count his wealth he bethought himself of his native valley and resolved to go back thither and end his days where he was born with this purpose in view he sent a skilful architect to build him such a palace as should be fit for a man of his vast wealth to live in as i have said above it had already been rumored in the valley that mr gathergold had turned out to be the prophetic personage so long and vainly looked for and that his visage was the perfect and undeniable similitude of the great stone face people were the more ready to believe that this must needs be the fact when they beheld the splendid edifice that rose as if by enchantment on the site of his father s old weather beaten farmhouse the exterior was of marble so dazzlingly white that it seemed as though the whole structure might melt away in the sunshine like those humbler ones which mr gathergold in his young play days before his fingers were gifted with the touch of transmutation had been accustomed to build of snow it had a richly ornamented portico supported by tall pillars beneath which was a lofty door studded with silver knobs and made of a kind of

soaked countenance that made philip recoil so sharply from the sight of his own handiwork he had fought too often at school to be chicken hearted about a little bloodshed and besides he knew that his cousin was only knocked about not really injured but rather the intense and almost devilish malignity of the expression that hovered on the blurred features and in the half closed eyes but no attempt was made by george to translate the look into words and indeed philip felt that it was untranslatable he also felt dimly that the hate and malice with which he was regarded by the individual at his feet was of a more concentrated and enduring character than most men have the power to originate in the lurid light of that one glance he was able though he was not very clever to pierce the darkest

satisfaction the old gentleman for he was old made so pretty a picture framed as he was in the arched doorway and set off by a natural background of varying shades of green that his general appearance is worth sketching as he stood to begin with he was dressed in the fashion of the commencement of this century and as has been said old though it was difficult to say how old indeed so vigorous and comparatively youthful was his bearing that he was generally taken to be considerably under seventy but as a matter of fact he was but a few years short of eighty he was extremely tall over six feet and stood upright as a lifeguardsman indeed his height and stately carriage would alone have made him a remarkable looking man had there been nothing else unusual about him but as it happened his features were as uncommon as his person they were clear cut and cast in a noble mould the nose was large and aquiline the chin like his son philip s square and determined but it was his eyes that gave a painful fascination to his countenance they were steely blue and glittered under the pent house of his thick eyebrows that in striking contrast to the snow white of his hair were black in hue as tempered steel glitters in a curtained room it was those eyes in conjunction with sundry little peculiarities of temper that had earned for the old man the title of devil caresfoot a sobriquet in

down stairs for perhaps we had better not go now just after he is tired with coming down said mrs wortley now mr arundel you will tell me honestly and this arrowroot will do just as well another time or if marian will carry home the message well said edmund smiling to give you a proof of my sincerity i think you had better perhaps go rather later in the day my uncle very unnecessarily hurried himself thinking that he was keeping me waiting to help him down stairs and i thought he seemed rather tired but he will be very glad to see you in the afternoon indeed he would be very glad now only you asked me as a question of prudence don t make civil speeches at the end to spoil just such a reply as i wanted said mrs wortley i am afraid you do not think sir edmund much better since you were last at home edmund shook his head if he has not lost ground it is well said he and i think at least there is less pain well i will not keep you any longer said mrs wortley good bye and good sport to you and with a wave of the hand on rode the two cousins edmund and marian arundel what an excellent thing it is for the village that those wortleys are come said edmund yes now that mamma cannot attend much to the school and poor people i don t know what we should do without them how different it was in old mr may s time i hope we shall get the church set to rights now when papa is well enough to attend to it it is high time certainly said edmund our church is almost a disgrace to us especially with the arundel aisle to show what our ancestors did no not quite to us said marian you know papa would have done it all long ago if the idea had not vexed poor old mr may so much but ranger ranger where is ranger edmund edmund whistled and presently with whirring rushing wing there flew over the hedge beside them a covey of partridges followed by ranger s eager bark marian s pony started danced and capered edmund watched her with considerable anxiety but she reined it in with a steady dexterous though not a strong hand kept her seat well and rode on in triumph while edmund exclaimed capital marian then looking back what a shot that was he added in a sort of parenthesis continuing i am proud mayflower is not a bit too much for you now though i think we must have given her up if you had had another tumble oh no no i do so delight in mayflower pretty creature said marian patting her neck i like to feel that the creature i ride is alive not an old slug like that animal which you are upon edmund that is decidedly ungrateful of you marian when you learnt to ride upon this identical slug and owe the safety of your neck to its quiet propensities now take care down this stony hill hold her up well that is right care was certainly needed as they descended the steep hill side the road or rather pathway cut out between high steep limestone rocks and here and there even bare of earth any one but a native would have trembled at such a descent but though the cousins paid attention to their progress they had no doubts or alarms at the bottom a clear sparkling stream traversed the road where for the convenience of foot passengers a huge flat stone had been thrown across from one high bank to the other so as to form a romantic bridge marian however did not avail herself of it but rode gallantly through the shallow water only looking back at it to observe to edmund we must make a sketch of that some day or other i am afraid we cannot get far enough off said edmund to make a good drawing of it too many things go to the making of the picturesque yes i know but that is what i never can understand i see by woeful experience that what is pretty in itself will not make a pretty drawing and everyone says so but i never could find out why perhaps because we cannot represent it adequately yes but there is another puzzle you sometimes see an exact representation which is not really a picture at all don t you know that thing that the man who came to the door did of our house the trees all green and the sky all blue and the moors all purple as like as it can stare yes i know well why does that not satisfy us why is it not a picture because it stares i suppose why does not that picture of my aunt at mrs week s cottage satisfy you as well as the chalk sketch in the dining room because it has none of herself her spirit well i should say that nature has a self and a spirit which must be caught or else the chinese would be the greatest artists on the face of the earth yes but why does an archway or two trees standing up so as to enclose the landscape or or any of those things that do to put in the foreground why do they enable you to make a picture to catch this self and spirit make the phial to enclose the genie said edmund abstruse questions marian but perhaps it is because they contract the space so as to bring it more to the level of our capacity make it less grand and more what we can get into keeping to be sure he would be a presumptuous man who tried to make an exact likeness of that he added as they reached the top of the hill and found themselves on an open common with here and there a mass of rock peeping up but for the most part covered with purple heath and short furze through which ranger coursed barking joyously the view was splendid on one side the moors rising one behind the other till they faded in grey

was beaten she flung out the white flag of fatigue and no beleaguered city ever flew that flag in such bitterness and tears now i shall tell you the whole tale and you must believe me for i know they had pondered the problem of satiety they loved love they knew to the uttermost farthing the value of love they loved him so well that they were fain to keep him always warm and a thrill in their hearts they welcomed his coming they feared to have him depart love was desire they held a delicious pain he was ever seeking easement and when he found that for which he sought he died love denied was love alive love granted was love deceased do you follow me they saw it was not the way of life to be hungry for what it has to eat and still be hungry man has never accomplished that feat the problem of satiety that is it to have and to keep the sharp famine edge of appetite at the groaning board this was their problem for they loved love often did they discuss it with all love s sweet ardours brimming in their eyes his ruddy blood spraying their cheeks his voice playing in and out with their voices now hiding as a tremolo in their throats and again shading a tone with that ineffable tenderness which he alone can utter how do i know all this i saw much more i learned from her diary this i found in it from fiona macleod for truly that wandering voice that twilight whisper

some rapt visionaries at least not with a song upon the lips that all may hear or with blithe viol of public music but as one wrought by ecstasy dumbly eloquent with desire how to keep the flame winged lute player with his dumb eloquence of desire to feast him was to lose him their love for each other was a great love their granaries were overflowing with plenitude yet they wanted to keep the sharp famine edge of their love undulled nor were they lean little fledglings theorizing on the threshold of love they were robust and realized souls they had loved before with others in the days before they met and in those days they had throttled love with caresses and killed him with kisses and buried him in the pit of satiety they were not cold wraiths this man and woman they were warm human they had no saxon soberness in their blood the colour of it was sunset red they glowed with it temperamentally theirs was the french joy in the flesh they were idealists but their idealism was gallic it was not tempered by the chill and sombre fluid that for the english serves as blood there was no stoicism about them they were americans descended out of the english and yet the refraining and self denying of the english spirit groping were not theirs they were all this that i have said and they were made for joy only they achieved a concept a curse on concepts they played with logic and this was their logic but first let me tell you of a talk we had one night it was of gautier s madeline de maupin you remember the maid she kissed once and once only and kisses she would have no more not that she found kisses were not sweet but that she feared with repetition they would cloy satiety again she tried to play without stakes against the gods now this is contrary to a rule of the game the gods themselves have made only the rules are not posted over the table mortals must play in order to learn the rules well to the logic the man and the woman argued thus why kiss once only if to kiss once were wise was it not wiser to kiss not at all thus could they keep love alive fasting he would knock forever at their hearts perhaps it was out of their heredity that they achieved this unholy concept the breed will out and sometimes most fantastically thus in them did cursed albion array herself a scheming wanton a bold cold calculating and artful hussy after all i do not know but

has to take part in the spring chorus at the smiling pool and that he is late peter looked very hard at jimmy to see if he was fooling or telling the truth then he began to laugh old mr toad sing the

think he must have eaten something that has gone to his head there s unc billy possum over there let s ask him what he thinks so jimmy and peter joined unc billy and jimmy told the story about old mr

minutes he stopped laughing ah done learn a right smart long time ago that ah don know all there is to know about mah neighbors said he we uns done think of brer toad as ugly lookin fo so long that we

really is up to the very thing cried peter kicking up his heels you know peter is always ready to go anywhere or do anything that will satisfy his curiosity jimmy skunk thought it over for a few minutes and then he decided that as he hadn t anything in particular to do and as he might find some fat beetles on the way he would go too so off they started after old mr toad peter rabbit in the

toad was hurrying as fast as ever he could and was quite out of breath he wasn t getting along very fast compared with the way peter rabbit or jimmy skunk or unc billy possum could cover the ground you see he cannot make long jumps like his cousin grandfather frog but only little short hops so peter and jimmy and unc billy took their time about following him they stopped to hunt for fat beetles for jimmy skunk and at every little patch of sweet clover for peter rabbit to help himself once they wasted a lot of time while unc billy possum hunted for a nest of carol the meadow lark on the chance that he would find some fresh eggs there he didn t find the nest for the very good reason that carol hadn t built one yet peter was secretly glad you know he doesn t eat eggs and he is always sorry for his feathered friends when their eggs are stolen half way across the green meadows they stopped to play with the merry little breezes and because it was very pleasant there they played longer than they realized when at last they started on again old mr toad was out of sight you see all the time he had kept right on going hop hop hipperty hop never mind said peter we can catch up with him easy enough he s such a slow poke but even a slow poke who keeps right on doing a thing without wasting any time always gets somewhere sooner or later very often sooner than those who are naturally quicker but who waste their time so it was with old mr toad he kept right on hop hop hipperty hop while the others were playing and so it happened that when at last peter and jimmy and unc billy reached the smiling pool they hadn t caught another glimpse of old mr toad do you suppose he hid somewhere and we passed him asked peter unc billy shook his head ah don reckon so said he we uns done been foolin away our time an brer toad done stole a march on us ah reckons we uns will find him sittin on the bank here somewhere so right away the three separated to look for old mr toad all

if we remember in what a different shape the revolution has now by change of circumstance and occasion come to present itself to those who are most ardent in the search after new paths an estimate of

acquiescence he has developed a historic sense the most hearty aversion to the prolonged reign of some of the old gods does not hinder him from seeing that what are now frigid and unlovely blocks were full of vitality and light in days before the era of their petrifaction there is much less eagerness of praise or blame and much less faith in knife and cautery less confidence that new and right growth will naturally and necessarily follow upon demolition the revolution has never had that long hold on the national imagination in england either as an idol or a bugbear which is essential to keep the poet who sings it in effective harmony with new generations of readers more than this the byronic conception was as transitional and inadequate as the methods and ideas of the practical movers who were to a man left stranded in every country in europe during the period of his poetic activity a transitional and unstable movement of society inevitably fails to supply a propulsion powerful enough to make its poetic expression eternal there is no better proof of the enormous force of byron s genius than that it was able to produce so fine an expression of elements so intrinsically unfavourable to high poetry as doubt denial antagonism and weariness but this force was no guarantee for perpetuity of influence bare rebellion cannot endure and no succession of generations can continue nourishing themselves on the poetry of complaint and the idealisation of revolt if however it is impossible that byron should be all to us that he was to a former generation and if we find no direct guidance in his muse this is no reason why criticism should pass him over nor why there may not be something peculiarly valuable in the noble freedom and genuine modernism of his poetic spirit to an age that is apparently only forsaking the clerical idyll of one school for the reactionary medi valism or paganism intrinsically meaningless and issueless of another more attention is now paid to the mysteries of byron s life than to the merits of his work and criticism and morality are equally injured by the confusion between the worth of the verse he wrote and the virtue or wickedness of the life he lived the admirers of his poetry appear sensible of some obligation to be the champions of his conduct while those who have diligently gathered together the details

of country with the exception of belts of settlements along the two great rivers named was a wilderness anterior to the american revolution there was a minor class of exceptions to this general rule however to which it will be proper to advert lest by conceiving us too literally the reader may think he can convict us of a contradiction in order to be fully understood the explanations shall be given at a little length while it is true then that the mountainous region which now contains the counties of schoharie otsego chenango broome delaware c was a wilderness in the colonial governors had begun to make grants of its lands some twenty years earlier the patent of the estate on which we are writing lies before us and it bears the date of with an indian grant annexed that is a year or two older this may be taken as a mean date for the portion of country alluded to some of the deeds being older and others still more recent these grants of land were originally made subject to quit rents to the crown and usually on the payment of heavy fees to the colonial officers after going through the somewhat supererogatory duty of extinguishing the indian title as it was called the latter were pretty effectually extinguished in that day as well as in our own and it would be a matter of curious research to ascertain the precise nature of the purchase money given to the aborigines in the case of the patent before us the indian right was extinguished by means of a few rifles blankets kettles and beads though the grant covers a nominal hundred thousand and a real hundred and ten or twenty thousand acres of land the abuse of the grants as land became more valuable induced a law restricting the number of acres patented to any one person at any one time to a thousand our monarchical predecessors had the same facilities and it may be added the same propensities to rendering a law a dead letter as belongs to our republican selves the patent on our table being for a nominal hundred thousand acres contains the names of one hundred different grantees while three several parchment documents at its side each signed by thirty three of these very persons vest the legal estate in the first named for whose sole benefit the whole concession was made the dates of the last instruments succeeding by one or two days that of the royal patent itself such is the history of most of the original titles to the many estates that dotted the region we have described prior to the revolution money and favouritism however were not always the motives of these large concessions occasionally services presented their claims and many instances occur in which old officers of the army in particular received a species of reward by a patent for land the fees being duly paid and the indian title righteously extinguished these grants to ancient soldiers were seldom large except in the cases of officers of rank three or four thousand well selected acres being a sufficient boon to the younger sons of scottish lairds or english squires who had been accustomed to look upon a single farm as an estate as most of the soldiers mentioned were used to forest life from having been long stationed at frontier posts and had thus become familiarized with its privations and hardened against its dangers it was no unusual thing for them to sell out or go on half pay when the wants of a family began to urge their claims and to retire to their patents as the land itself as well as the instrument by which it was granted was invariably termed with a view of establishing themselves permanently as landlords these grants from the crown in the portions of the colony of new york that lie west of the river counties were generally if not invariably simple concessions of the fee subject to quit rents to the king and reservations of mines of the precious metals without any of the privileges of feudal seignory as existed in the older manors on the hudson on the islands and on the sound why this distinction was made it exceeds our power to say but that the fact was so as a rule we have it in proof by means of a great number of the original patents themselves that have been transmitted to us from various sources still the habits of home entailed the name even where the thing was not to be found titular manors exist in a few instances to this day where no manorial rights were ever granted and manor houses were common appellations for the residences of the landlords of large estates that were held in fee without any exclusive privileges and subject to the reservation named some of these manorial residences were of so primitive an appearance as to induce the belief that the names were bestowed in pleasantry the dwellings themselves being of logs with the bark still on them and the other fixtures to correspond notwithstanding all these drawbacks early impressions and rooted habits could easily transfer terms to such an abode and there was always a saddened enjoyment among these exiles when they could liken their forest names and usages to those they had left in the distant scenes of their childhood the effect of the different causes we have here given was to dot the region

another an unhealthy departure from the central norma and standard of the race good teeth mean good deglutition a clear eye means an active liver scrubbiness and undersizedness mean feeble virility

conduct of the council at bombay indeed no explanation has ever been given as to why they took up the cause of rugoba the scoundrel who grasped the crown and who was privy to if he did not instigate the murder of his nephew the young peishwa he was not unopposed for nana furnuwees and hurry punt two of the leading mahratta ministers formed a regency under gunga bye the widow of the murdered peishwa while matters were undecided the bombay council opened communications with rugoba who they thought was likely to be successful and promised to assist him if he would advance a considerable sum of money and cede to the company salsette the small islands contiguous to bombay and bassein which had been captured from the portuguese by the mahrattas an altogether inexcusable arrangement as the mahrattas were at peace with us and rugoba was not in a position to hand the islands over that matter however was settled by sending an expedition which captured salsette and tannah in four years ago since then rugoba has become a fugitive and without a shadow of reason is making war against the whole force of the mahratta confederacy who although divided amongst themselves and frequently engaged in the struggles for supremacy have united against us for they say that scindia holkar and hurry punt are in command of their army to send four thousand men of whom less than six hundred are europeans against the whole mahratta power is a desperate step i know we have fought and won against greater odds many times in the history of india but our forces have always been well led marched with the smallest amount of baggage possible and made up for inferiority in numbers by speed activity and dash here on the contrary we have a force hampered to an unheard of degree by baggage and camp followers with an invalid at its head controlled by two civilians and moving at a rate which in itself testifies to divided councils and utter incompetency on the part of its commander it is almost impossible even to hope for success under such conditions the lookout is certainly bad the younger officer agreed however before now the fighting powers of the british soldier have made up for the blunders of his commanders and we may hope that this will be the case now if a disaster happen the major said we shall have the mahrattas down at the gates of bombay and as soon as i hear a rumour of it and news travels wonderfully fast among the natives i shall return to the city oh i don t think you need fear anything of that sort major besides this is not on the direct line between the ghauts and the city and even if they find they cannot push on i should say our force would be able to secure their retreat the mahratta horse will never be able to break our squares but of course in that case we should have to abandon all our baggage and baggage animals i agree with you that the mahrattas would doubtless hang on the skirts of our force and follow them down the bhore ghaut and so would not come anywhere near us but they might detach flying parties to burn and plunder as is their custom brave as they are the mahrattas do not fight for the love of fighting but simply from the hope of plunder and of enlarging their territories well we may hope in a day or two to hear that a battle has been fought and that a victory has been won not that one victory would settle the matter for the mahratta force consists almost entirely of cavalry and as we have only a handful they would if beaten simply ride off and be ready to fight again another day if we had pushed on and occupied poona directly we landed which should have been easy enough if the baggage train had been left behind for it is but forty miles from panwell to the mahratta capital the position would have been altogether different the mahrattas would not have had time to collect their forces and we should probably have met with no opposition and once in poona could have held it against the whole mahratta force besides

cheerfulness to the morning meal they sat in pensive silence for a while and were glad when mr merrick pushed back his chair and rose from the table as beth and patsy followed their uncle into the cosy library where he was accustomed to smoke his morning cigar the little man remarked let s see this is the seventh of september quite right uncle said patsy isn t this the day maud stanton is due to arrive no replied beth she will come to morrow morning it s a good four days trip from california to new york you know i wonder why she is coming here at this time of year said patsy reflectively and i wonder if her aunt jane or her sister flo are with her she did not mention them in her telegram answered beth all she said was to expect her wednesday morning it seems quite mysterious that telegram for i had no idea maud thought of coming east well we will know all about it when she arrives observed uncle john i will be glad to see maud again for she is one of my especial favorites she

dragging him joyously by the arm this is certainly a surprise said mr merrick shaking the tall slender youth by the hand with evident pleasure when did you get to town asked beth greeting the boy cordially and why didn t you let us know you were on the way from far off los angeles well said jones seating himself facing them and softly rubbing his lean hands together to indicate his satisfaction at this warm reception it s a long long story and i may as well tell it methodically or you ll never appreciate the adventurous spirit that led me again to new york the one place i heartily detest oh ajo protested patsy is this the way to retain the friendship of new yorkers isn t honesty appreciated here he wanted to know go ahead with your story said uncle john we left you some months ago at the harbor of los angeles wondering what you were going to do with that big ship of yours that lay anchored in the pacific if i remember aright you were considering whether you dared board it to return to that mysterious island home of yours at at sangoa said patsy thank you for giving me a starting point returned the boy with a smile you may remember that when i landed in your country from sangoa i was a miserable invalid the voyage had ruined my stomach and wrecked my constitution i crossed the continent to new york and consulted the best specialists and they nearly put an end to me i returned to the pacific coast to die as near home as possible and and there i met you and patsy saved your life added beth she did first however maud stanton saved me from drowning then patsy doyle doctored me and made me well and strong and now and now you look like a modern hercules asserted patsy gazing with some pride at the bronzed cheeks and clear eyes of the former

boys went out west and to the great lakes and later spent a fine time hunting in the mountains they likewise spent some time in camp with their fellow cadets and during the summer vacation took a long trip on land and sea then they returned home and during another vacation sailed down the ohio river in a houseboat spent some time on the plains took an unexpected trip to southern waters and then came back to the farm on getting back home as related in the twelfth volume of this series called the rover boys on the farm the boys had imagined that adventures for them were a thing of the past they were willing to take it easy but this was not to be some bad men including a sharper named sid merrick were responsible for the theft of some freight from the local railroad and merrick by a slick trick obtained possession of some traction company bonds belonging to randolph rover the rover boys managed to locate the freight thieves but sid merrick got away from them dropping a pocketbook containing the traction company bonds in his flight this was at a time when dick tom and sam had returned to putnam hall for their final term at that institution at the hall they had made a bitter

the snake got away and hid in nick pell s desk and nick was bitten and for some time it was feared that he might die he exposed tad sobber and fearing arrest the bully ran away from the hall later

some day did he mention any names questioned sam yes mine yes and dick s and tom s too it is just like sobber to blame his troubles on somebody else remarked dick i am not afraid of him declared tom he had better keep his distance unless he wants to get the worst of it we used to put up with a whole lot from dan baxter before he reformed i am not going to put up with as much from sobber tad

compass as to have made my letter too long or my observations too light and superficial as others have done before me this letter will divide the weighty task and consequently make it sit lighter on the memory be pleasanter to the reader and make my progress the more regular i shall therefore take in hampton court and windsor in this journey the first at my setting out and the last at my return and the rest as their situation demands as i came down from kingston in my last circuit by the south bank of the thames on the surrey side of the river so i go up to hampton court now on the north bank and on the middlesex side which i mention because as the sides of the country bordering on the river lie parallel so the beauty of the country the pleasant situations the glory of innumerable fine buildings noblemen s and gentlemen s houses and citizens retreats are so equal a match to what i had described on the other side that one knows not which to give the preference to but as i must speak of them again when i come to write of the county of middlesex which i have now purposely omitted so i pass them over here except the palace of hampton only which i mentioned in middlesex for the reasons above hampton court lies on the north bank of the river thames about two small miles from kingston and on the road from staines to kingston bridge so that the road straightening the parks a little they were obliged to part the parks and leave the paddock and the great park part on the other side the road a testimony of that just regard that the kings of england always had and still have to the common good and to the service of the country that they would not interrupt the course of the road or cause the poor people to go out of the way of their business to or from the markets and fairs for any pleasure of their own whatsoever the palace of hampton court was first founded and built from the ground by that great statesman and favourite of king henry viii cardinal wolsey and if it be a just observation anywhere as is made from the situation of the old abbeys and monasteries the clergy were excellent judges of the beauty and pleasantness of the country and chose always to plant in the best i say if it was a just observation in any case it was in this for if there be a situation on the whole river between staines bridge and windsor bridge pleasanter than another it is this of hampton close to the river yet not offended by the rising of its waters in floods or storms near to the reflux of the tides but not quite so near as to be affected with any foulness of the water which the flowing of the tides generally is the occasion of the gardens extend almost to the bank of the river yet are never overflowed nor are there any marshes on either side the river to make the waters stagnate or the air unwholesome on that account the river is high enough to be navigable and low enough to be a little pleasantly rapid so that the stream looks always cheerful not slow and sleeping like a pond this keeps the waters always clear and clean the bottom in view the fish playing and in sight and in a word it has everything that can make an inland or as i may call it a country river pleasant and agreeable i shall sing you no songs here of the river in the first person of a water nymph a goddess and i know not what according to the humour of the ancient poets i shall talk nothing of the marriage of old isis the male river with the beautiful thame the female river a whimsey as simple as the subject was empty but i shall speak of the river as occasion presents as it really is made glorious by the splendour of its shores gilded with noble palaces strong fortifications large hospitals and public buildings with the greatest bridge and the greatest city in the world made famous by the opulence of its merchants the increase and extensiveness of its commerce by its invincible navies and by the innumerable fleets of ships sailing upon it to and from all parts of the world as i meet with the river upwards in my travels through the inland country i shall speak of it as it is the channel for conveying an infinite quantity of provisions from remote counties to london and enriching all the counties\", \"target\": 2, \"compound\": 0.9996, \"neg\": 0.028, \"neu\": 0.808, \"pos\": 0.164}, {\"date\": 1902, \"info\": \"The Hound of the Baskervilles\", \"text\": \"might

pamphlet after pamphlet he published a newspaper which he called the review in which he generally sided with the moderate whigs advocated earnestly the union with scotland and gave the english people a vast deal of good advice upon foreign policy and domestic trade there is no doubt that during this time he was in the secret service of the government when the tories displaced the whigs in he managed to keep his post and took his review over to the support of the new masters justifying his turncoating by a disingenuous plea of preferring country to party his pamphleteering pen was now as active in the service of the tory prime minister harley as it had been in that of the whig godolphin the party of the latter rightly regarded him as a traitor to their cause and secured an order from the court of queen s bench directing the attorney general to prosecute defoe for certain pamphlets which they declared were directed against the hanoverian succession before the trial took place harley at whose instigation the pamphlets had been written secured his henchman a royal pardon when the tories fell from power at the death of queen anne and the whigs again obtained possession of the government only one of two courses was open to defoe he must either retire permanently from politics or again change sides he unhesitatingly chose the latter but his political reputation had now sunk so low that no party could afford the disgrace of his open support he was accordingly employed as a literary and political spy ostensibly opposing the government worming himself into the confidence of tory editors and politicians using his influence as an editorial writer to suppress items obnoxious to the government and suggesting the timely prosecution of such critics as he could not control he was able to play this double part for eight years until his treachery was discovered by one mist whose journal defoe had in his own words disabled and enervated so as to do no mischief or give any offense to the government mist hastened to disclose defoe s real character to his fellow newspaper proprietors and in we find the good daniel sorrowfully complaining i had not published my project in this pamphlet could i have got it inserted in any of the journals without feeing the journalists or publishers i have not only had the mortification to find what i sent rejected but to lose my originals not having taken copies of what i wrote heavy footed justice had at last overtaken the arch liar of his age of the two hundred and fifty odd books and pamphlets written by defoe it may fairly be said that only two robinson crusoe and the history of the plague in london are read by any but the special students of eighteenth century literature the latter will be discussed in another part of this introduction of the former it may be asserted that it arose naturally out of the circumstances of defoe s trade as a journalist so long as the papers would take his articles nobody of distinction could die without defoe s rushing out with a biography of him in these biographies when facts were scanty defoe supplied them from his imagination attributing to his hero such sentiments as he thought the average londoner could understand and describing his appearance with that minute fidelity of which only an eyewitness is supposed to be capable long practice in this kind of composition made defoe an adept in the art of lying like truth when therefore the actual and extraordinary adventures of alexander selkirk came under his notice nothing was more natural and more profitable for defoe than to seize upon this material and work it up just as he worked up the lives of jack sheppard the highwayman and of avery the king of the pirates it is interesting to notice also that the date of publication of robinson crusoe corresponds with a time at which defoe was playing the desperate and dangerous game of a political spy a single false move might bring him a stab in the dark or might land him in the hulks for transportation to some tropical island where he might have abundant need for the exercise of those mental resources that interest us so much in crusoe the secret of defoe s life at this time was known only to himself and to the minister that paid him he was almost as much alone in london as was crusoe on his desert island the success which defoe scored in robinson crusoe he never repeated his entire lack of artistic conscience is shown by his adding a dull second part to robinson crusoe and a duller series of serious reflections such as might have passed through crusoe s mind during his island captivity of even the best of defoe s other novels moll flanders roxana captain singleton the writer must confess that his judgment coincides with that of mr leslie stephen who finds two thirds of them deadly dull and the treatment such as cannot raise the story above a very moderate level the closing scenes of defoe s life were not cheerful he

from his home though why he fled and from what danger is not definitely known he died in a lodging in ropemaker s alley moorfields on april the only description we have of defoe s personal appearance

then too they were very ignorant men they read nothing for nothing mattered but knowing how to paint being in reaction against a generation that seemed to have wasted its time upon so many things i thought myself alone in hating these young men now indeed getting towards middle life their contempt for the past their monopoly of the future but in a few months i was to discover others of my own age who thought as i did for it is not true that youth looks before it with the mechanical gaze of a well drilled soldier its quarrel is not with the past but with the present where its elders are so

though from it certainly does come so much proletarian rhetoric i was unlike others of my generation in one thing only i am very religious and deprived by huxley and tyndall whom i detested of the simple minded religion of my childhood i had made a new religion almost an infallible church out of poetic tradition a fardel of stories and of personages and of emotions inseparable from their first

if he had liked anything strongly he might have been a famous man for a few years later he was to write under some casual patriotic impulse certain excellent verses now in all irish anthologies but

rhythm to his style and remained always a poor writer i was too full of unfinished speculations and premature convictions to value rightly his conversation informed by a vast erudition which would give itself to every casual association of speech and company precisely because he had neither cause nor design my father however found powell s concrete narrative manner in talk a necessary

of entire strangers would have been different under less intense circumstances but at that time any one who appeared interested in my child was at once my friend not only the conspicuous and influential but the humble and uncultivated as well looking back over those trying weeks i now remember hosts of delicate attentions dispensed by the unpretentious that at the time were hardly realized owing to the effusive ostentations of the sandersons since i have studied carefully the events which followed rapidly from the beginning of our acquaintance i am certain that neither marjorie nor myself would have received the slightest notice from either mrs sanderson or her son had we failed in their selfish entertainment my little girl beautiful and bright unconsciously stole into the coldest hearts but i know now that it was not her delicate frame nor the pathos of a defrauded childhood that won the devotion of mrs sanderson it was simply that marjorie was an additional amusement an additional effect enlivening the small court which the lady invariably held the capricious woman petted the child only for entertainment a thoroughbred dog or a kitten could have won her interest as successfully had her passing mood been favorable to their antics her fancy for myself was equally selfish i was young enough to interest her son and from the first she evidently regarded me as a convenient and suitable companion for the winter i learned afterwards that mrs sanderson was notoriously fond of young widows she treated them with unusual favor in view of eventual schemes which she generally worked her only idea of life was entertainment and in order to satisfy her thirst for novelty she had always chosen pretty widows to expand her power and promote her individual caprices unincumbered by the unreasonable demands of a husband she regarded a pathetic young widow a most desirable companion always securing if possible a fresh one for the nucleus of her social experiments

there was no one who understood my happiness like mrs sanderson it never occurred to me to doubt her sincerity that she was often haughty and disagreeable to others i saw but for me she had only indulgence and delicate sympathy under calming climatic influences my pagan intuitions grew hourly beneath the lights and shadows of the prophetic mountains analytical tendencies ceased possibly my creeds became unorthodox but they expanded cheerfully each day that they might hold more of god s harmonious universe and less of man s deformity i believed afresh in universal philanthropy the sweet lethargic days were satisfying i had no desire to analyze the motives of my associates i was no longer interested in attenuated studies of character the book of nature and the literal tales of mother

shaw there are many reasons for it which ought to be adequately considered in such a book as this but the first and most obvious reason is the mere statement that george bernard shaw was born in dublin in at least one reason why englishmen cannot understand mr shaw is that englishmen have never taken the trouble to understand irishmen they will sometimes be generous to ireland but never just to ireland they will speak to ireland they will speak for ireland but they will not hear ireland speak all the real amiability which most englishmen undoubtedly feel towards irishmen is lavished upon a class of irishmen which unfortunately does not exist the irishman of the english farce with his brogue his buoyancy and his tender hearted irresponsibility is a man who ought to have been thoroughly pampered with praise and sympathy if he had only existed to receive them unfortunately all the time that we were creating a comic irishman in fiction we were creating a tragic irishman in fact never perhaps has there been a situation of such excruciating cross purposes even in the three act farce the more we saw in the irishman a sort of warm and weak fidelity the more he regarded us with a sort of icy anger the more the oppressor looked down with an amiable pity the more did the oppressed look down with a somewhat unamiable contempt but indeed it is needless to say that such comic cross purposes could be put into a play they have been put into a play they have been put into what is perhaps the most real of mr bernard shaw s plays john bull s other island it is somewhat absurd to imagine that any one who has not read a play by mr shaw will be reading a book about him but if it comes to that it is as i clearly perceive absurd to be writing a book about mr bernard shaw at all it is indefensibly foolish to attempt to explain a man whose whole object through life has been to explain himself but even in nonsense there is a need for logic and consistency therefore let us proceed on the assumption that when i say that all mr shaw s blood and origin may be found in john bull s other island some reader may answer that he does not know the play besides it is more important to put the reader right about england and ireland even than to put him right about shaw if he reminds me that this is a book about shaw i can only assure him that i will reasonably and at proper intervals remember the fact mr shaw himself said once i am a typical irishman my family came from yorkshire scarcely anyone but a typical irishman could have made the remark it is in fact a bull a conscious bull a bull is only a paradox which people are too stupid to understand it is the rapid summary of something which is at once so true and so complex that the speaker who has the swift intelligence to perceive it has not the slow patience to explain it mystical dogmas are much of this kind dogmas are often spoken of as if they were signs of the slowness or endurance of the human mind as a matter of fact they are marks of mental promptitude and lucid impatience a man will put his meaning mystically because he cannot waste time in putting it rationally dogmas are not dark and mysterious rather a dogma is like a flash of lightning an instantaneous lucidity that opens across a whole landscape of the same nature are irish bulls they are summaries which are too true to be consistent the irish make irish bulls for the same reason that they accept papal bulls it is because it is better to speak wisdom foolishly like the saints rather than to speak folly wisely like the dons this is the truth about mystical dogmas and the truth about irish bulls it is also the truth about the paradoxes of bernard shaw each of them is an argument impatiently shortened into an epigram each of them represents a truth hammered and hardened with an almost disdainful violence until it is compressed into a small space until it is made brief and almost incomprehensible the case of that curt remark about ireland and yorkshire is a very typical one if mr shaw had really attempted to set out all the sensible stages of his joke the sentence would have run something like this that i am an irishman is a fact of psychology which i can trace in many of the things that come out of me my fastidiousness my frigid fierceness and my distrust of mere pleasure but the thing must be tested by what comes from me do not try on me the dodge of asking where i came from how many batches of three hundred and sixty five days my family was in ireland do not play any games on me about whether i am a celt a word that is dim to the anthropologist and utterly unmeaning to anybody else do not start any drivelling discussions about whether the word shaw is german or scandinavian or iberian or basque you know you are human i know i am irish i know i belong to a certain type and temper of society and i know that all sorts of people of all sorts of blood live in that society and by that society and are therefore irish you can take your books of anthropology to hell or to oxford thus gently elaborately and at length mr shaw would have explained his meaning if he had thought it worth his while as he did not he merely flung the symbolic but very complete sentence i am a typical irishman my family came from yorkshire what then is the colour of this irish society of which bernard shaw with all his individual oddity is yet an essential type one generalisation i think may at least be made ireland has in it a quality which caused it in the most ascetic age of christianity to be called the land of saints and which

for wherever adventures were to be obtained wherever blows were most plentiful james keith and his brother were certain to be in the midst of them but maggie drummond knew the reason for their holding aloof for she had shortly before the coming over of prince charlie received a short note from the field marshal they say that prince charles edward is meditating a mad scheme of crossing to scotland and raising his standard there if so do what you can to prevent your husband from joining him we made but a poor hand of it last time and the chances of success are vastly smaller now then it was but a comparatively short time since the stuarts had lost the throne of england and there were great numbers who wished them back now the hanoverian is very much more firmly seated on the throne the

should have made an excellent officer his mother the colonel s sister was true to the challoner strain his father a reckless irish sportsman but what was the story i haven t heard it after blake broke his neck when hunting the colonel brought dick up and as a matter of course sent him into the army he became a sapper and entering the indian service met his cousin bertram who was in the line somewhere on the frontier they were both sent with an expedition into the hills and there was a night attack it was important that an advanced post should be defended and dick had laid out the trenches in the middle of the fight an officer lost his nerve the position was stormed and the expedition terribly cut up owing to the darkness and confusion there was a doubt about who had led the retreat but dick was blamed and made no defence in spite of this he was acquitted at the inquiry perhaps because he was a favourite and colonel challoner was well known upon the frontier but the

very much perhaps this was because it had been such a task to win his love it had been no easy matter when he first drifted in mysteriously out of nowhere to their little mountain cottage footsore and famished he had killed a rabbit under their very noses and under their very windows and then crawled away and slept by the spring at the foot of the blackberry bushes when walt irvine went down to inspect the intruder he was snarled at for his pains and madge likewise was snarled at when she went down to present as a peace offering a large pan of bread and milk a most unsociable dog he proved to be resenting all their advances refusing to let them lay hands on him menacing them with bared fangs and bristling hair nevertheless he remained sleeping and resting by the spring and eating the food they gave him after they set it down at a safe distance and retreated his wretched physical condition explained why he lingered and when he had recuperated after several days sojourn he disappeared and this would have been the end of him so far as irvine and his wife were concerned had not irvine at that particular time been called away into the northern part of the state biding along on the train near to the line between california and oregon he chanced to look out of the window and saw his unsociable guest sliding along the wagon road brown and wolfish tired yet tireless dust covered and soiled with two hundred miles of travel now irvine was a man of impulse a poet he got off the train at the next station bought a piece of meat at a butcher shop and captured the vagrant on the outskirts of the town the return trip was made in the baggage car and so wolf came a second time to the mountain cottage here he was tied up for a week and made love to by the man and woman but it was very circumspect love making remote and alien as a traveller from another planet he snarled down their soft spoken love words he never barked in all the time they had him he was never known to bark to win him became a problem irvine liked problems he had a metal plate made on which was stamped return to walt irvine glen ellen sonoma county california this was riveted to a collar and strapped about the dog s neck then he was turned loose and promptly he disappeared a day later came a telegram from mendocino county in twenty hours he had made over a hundred miles to the north and was still going when captured he came back by wells fargo express was tied up three days and was loosed on the fourth and lost this time he gained southern oregon before he was caught and returned always as soon as he received his liberty he fled away and always he fled north he was possessed of an obsession that drove him north the homing instinct irvine called it after he had expended the selling price of a sonnet in getting the animal back from northern oregon another time the brown wanderer succeeded in traversing half the length of california all of oregon and most of washington before he was picked up and returned collect a remarkable thing was the speed with which he traveled fed up and rested as soon as he was loosed he devoted all his energy to getting over the ground on the first day s run he was known to cover as high as a hundred and fifty miles and after that he would average a hundred miles a day until caught he always arrived back lean and hungry and savage and always departed fresh and vigorous cleaving his way northward in response to some prompting of his being that no one could understand but at last after a futile year of flight he accepted the inevitable and elected to remain at the cottage where first he had killed the rabbit and slept by the spring even after that a long time elapsed before the man and woman succeeded in patting him it was a great victory for they alone were allowed to put hands on him he was fastidiously exclusive and no guest at the cottage ever succeeded in making up to him a low growl greeted such approach if any one had the hardihood to come nearer the lips lifted the naked fangs appeared and the growl became a snarl a snarl so terrible and malignant that it awed the stoutest of them as it likewise awed

did they get of the owner from whom he had evidently fled mrs johnson their nearest neighbor and the one who supplied them with milk proclaimed him a klondike dog her brother was burrowing for frozen pay streaks in that far country and so she constituted herself an authority on the subject but they did not dispute her there were the tips of wolf s ears obviously so severely frozen at some time that they would never quite heal again besides he looked like the photographs of the alaskan dogs they saw published in magazines and newspapers they often speculated over his past and tried to conjure up from what they had read and heard what his northland life had been that the northland still drew him they knew for at night they sometimes heard him crying softly and when the north wind blew and the bite of frost was in the air a great restlessness would come upon him and he would lift a mournful lament which they knew to be the long wolf howl yet he never barked no provocation was great enough to draw from him that canine cry long discussion they had during the time of winning him as to whose dog he was each claimed him and each proclaimed loudly any expression of affection made by him but the man had the better of it at first chiefly because he was a man it was patent that wolf had had no experience with women he did not understand women madge s skirts were something\",

sincere as he was also self denying which if the two virtues be well examined will indicate the same phase of character but of all modern writers mr froude has been the hardest to cicero his sketch of the life of c sar is one prolonged censure on that of cicero our historian with all that glory of language for which he is so remarkable has covered the poor orator with obloquy there is no period in cicero s life so touching i think as that during which he was hesitating whether in the service of the republic it did or did not behoove him to join pompey before the battle of pharsalia at this time he wrote to his friend atticus various letters full of agonizing doubts as to what was demanded from him by his duty to his country by his friendship for pompey by loyalty to his party and by his own dignity as to a passage in one of those mr froude says that cicero had lately spoken of c sar s continuance in life as a disgrace to the state it has been seen also that he had long thought of assassination as the readiest means of ending it says mr froude the it has been seen refers to a statement made a few pages earlier in which he translates certain words written by cicero to atticus he considered it a disgrace to them that c sar was alive that is his translation and in his indignation he puts other words as it were into the mouth of his literary brother of two thousand years before why did not somebody kill him the latin words themselves are added in a note cum vivere ipsum turpe sit nobis hot indignation has so carried the translator away that he has missed the very sense of cicero s language when even to draw the breath of life at such a time is a disgrace to us that is what cicero meant mr froude in a preceding passage gives us another passage from a letter to atticus c sar was mortal so much is an intended translation then mr froude tells us how cicero had hailed c sar s eventual murder with rapture and goes on to say we read the words with sorrow and yet with pity but cicero had never dreamed of c sar s murder the words of the passage are as follows hunc primum mortalem esse deinde etiam multis modis extingui posse cogitabam i bethought myself in the first place that this man was mortal and then that there were a hundred ways in which he might be put on one side all the latter authorities have i believe supposed the hunc or this man to be pompey i should say that this was proved by the gist of the whole letter one of the most interesting that was ever written as telling the workings of a great man s mind at a peculiar crisis of his life did i not know that former learned editors have supposed c sar to have been meant but whether c sar or pompey there is nothing in it to do with murder it is a question cicero is saying to his friend of the stability of the republic when a matter so great is considered how is a man to trouble himself as to an individual who may die any day or cease from any accident to be of weight cicero was speaking of the effect of this or that step on his own part am i he says for the sake of pompey to bring down hordes of barbarians on my own country sacrificing the republic for the sake of a friend who is here to day and may be gone to morrow or for the sake of an enemy if the reader thinks that the hunc refers to c sar the argument is the same am i to consider an individual when the republic is at stake mr froude tells us that he reads the words with sorrow and yet with pity so would every one i think sympathizing with the patriot s doubts as to his leader as to his party and as to his country mr froude does so because he gathers from them that cicero is premeditating the murder of c sar it is natural that a man should be judged out of his own mouth a man who speaks much and so speaks that his words shall be listened to and read will be so judged but it is not too much to demand that when a man s character is at stake his own words shall be thoroughly sifted before they are used against him the writer of the biographical notice in the encyclopedia britannica on cicero sends down to posterity a statement that in the time of the first triumvirate when our hero was withstanding the machinations of c sar and pompey against the liberties of rome he was open to be bought the augurship would have bought him so pitiful says the biographer was the bribe to which he would have sacrificed his honor his opinions and the commonwealth with no more sententious language was the character of a great man ever offered up to public scorn and on what evidence we should have known nothing of the bribe and the corruption but for a few playful words in a letter from cicero himself to atticus he is writing from one of his villas to his friend in rome and asks for the news of the day who are to be the new consuls who is to have the vacant augurship ah says he they might have caught even me with that bait as he said on another occasion that he was so much in debt as to be fit for a rebel and again as i shall have to explain just now that he was like to be called in question under the cincian law because of a present of books this was just at the point of his life when he was declining all offers of public service of public service for which his soul longed because they were made to him by c sar it was then that the vigintiviratus was refused which quintilian mentions to his honor it was then that he refused to be c sar s lieutenant it was then that he might have been fourth with c sar and pompey and crassus had he not felt himself bound not to serve against the republic and yet the

fantastic nonsense let us quote a word from the already old fashioned golden bough it must have appeared to the ancient aryan that the sun was periodically recruited from the fire which resided in the sacred oak exactly the fire which resided in the tree of life that is life itself so we must read it must have appeared to the ancient aryan that the sun was periodically recruited from life which is what the early greek philosophers were always saying and which still seems to me the real truth the clue to the cosmos instead of life being drawn from the sun it is the emanation from life itself that is from all the living plants and creatures which nourish the sun of course my dear critic the ancient aryans were just doddering the old duffers or babbling the babes but as for me i have some

mental attitude towards oneself and things in general makes one try to abstract some definite conclusions from one s experiences as a writer and as a man the novels and poems are pure passionate experience these pollyanalytics are inferences made afterwards from the experience and finally it seems to me that even art is utterly dependent on philosophy or if you prefer it on a metaphysic the metaphysic or philosophy may not be anywhere very accurately stated and may be quite unconscious in the artist yet it is a metaphysic that governs men at the time and is by all men more or less comprehended and lived men live and see according to some gradually developing and gradually withering vision this vision exists also as a dynamic idea or metaphysic exists first as such then it is unfolded into life and art our vision our belief our metaphysic is wearing woefully thin and the art is wearing absolutely threadbare we have no future neither for our hopes nor our aims nor our art it has all gone gray and opaque we ve got to rip the old veil of a vision across and find what the heart really believes in after all and what the heart really wants for the next future and we ve got

this wild spot with the sight of those lofty walls and the scent of the dry sweet sage there rushed over me a strange feeling that riders of the purple sage was true my dream people of romance had really lived there once upon a time i climbed high upon the huge stones and along the smooth red walls where pay larkin once had glided with swift sure steps and i entered the musty cliff dwellings and called out to hear the weird and sonorous echoes and i wandered through the thickets and upon the grassy spruce shaded benches never for a moment free of the story i had conceived there something of awe and sadness abided with me i could not enter into the merry pranks and investigations of my party surprise valley seemed a part of my past my dreams my very self i left it haunted by its loneliness and silence and beauty by the story it had given me that night we camped at bubbling spring which once had been a geyser of considerable power wetherill told a story of an old navajo who had lived there for a long time according to the indian tale the old chief resided there without complaining of this geyser that was wont to inundate his fields but one season the unreliable waterspout made great and persistent endeavor to drown him and his people and horses whereupon the old navajo took his gun and shot repeatedly at the geyser and thundered aloud his anger to the great spirit the geyser ebbed away and from that day never burst forth again illustration weird and wonderful monuments in monument valley illustration sunset on the desert illustration cave of the cliff dwellers somewhere under the great bulge of navajo mountain i calculated that we were coming to the edge of the plateau the white bobbing pack horses disappeared and then our extra mustangs it is no

boco as i came up i thought we had indeed reached the end of the world it s down in there said wetherill with a laugh nas ta bega made a slow sweeping gesture there is always something so significant and impressive about an indian when he points anywhere it is as if he says there way beyond over the ranges is a place i know and it is far the fact was that i looked at the piute s dark inscrutable face before i looked out into the void my gaze then seemed impelled and held by things afar a vast yellow and purple corrugated world of distance apparently now on a level with my eyes i was drawn by the beauty and grandeur of that scene and then i was transfixed almost by fear by the realization that i dared to venture down into this wild and upflung fastness i kept looking afar sweeping the three quarter circle of horizon till my judgment of distance was confounded and my sense of proportion dwarfed one moment and magnified the next wetherill was pointing and explaining but i had not grasped all he said you can see two hundred miles into utah he went on that bright rough surface like a washboard is wind worn rock those little lines of cleavage are canyons there are a thousand canyons down there and only a few have we been in that long purple ragged line is the grand canyon of the colorado and there that blue fork in the red that s where the san juan comes in and there s escalante canyon i had to adopt the indian s method of studying unlimited spaces in the desert to look with slow contracted eyes from near to far the pack train and the drivers had begun to zigzag down a long slope bare of rock with scant strips of green and here and there a cedar half a mile down the slope merged in what seemed a green level but i knew it was not level this level was a

harsh voice sorry to disturb you at your prayers guv nor but not having two pair of hands i can t serve a crowd meaning the old woman of the undergarments and myself mr potts slid off his stool and prepared for action when he saw however who the customer was he bristled that is the only word for it the truth is that although between us there was an inward and spiritual sympathy there was also an outward and visible hostility twice i had outbid mr potts at a local auction for articles which he desired moreover after the fashion of every good collector he felt it to be his duty to hate me as another collector lastly several times i had offered him smaller sums for antiques upon which he set a certain monetary value it is true that long ago i had given up this bargaining for the reason that mr potts would never take less than he asked indeed he followed the example of the vendor of the sibylline books in ancient rome he did not destroy the goods indeed after the fashion of that person and demand the price of all of them for the one that remained but invariably he put up his figure by per cent and nothing would induce him to take off one farthing what do you want sir he said grumpily vests hose collars or socks oh socks i think i replied at hazard thinking that they would be easiest to carry whereupon mr potts produced some peculiarly objectionable and shapeless woollen articles which he almost threw at me saying that they were all he had in stock now i detest woollen socks and never wear them still i made a purchase thinking with sympathy of my old gardener whose feet they would soon be scratching and while the parcel was being tied up said in an insinuating voice anything fresh upstairs mr potts no sir he answered shortly at least not much and if there were what s the use of showing them to you after the business about that clock it was you wanted for it mr potts i asked no sir it was and now it s per cent on to that you can work out the sum for yourself well let s have another look at it mr potts i replied humbly whereon with a grunt and a muttered injunction to tom to mind the shop he led the way upstairs now the house in which mr potts dwelt had once been of considerable pretensions and was very very old elizabethan i should think although it had been refronted with a horrible stucco to suit modern tastes the oak staircase was good though narrow and led to numerous small rooms upon two floors above some of which rooms were panelled and had oak beams now whitewashed like the panelling at least they had once been whitewashed probably in the last generation these rooms were literally crammed with every sort of old furniture most of it decrepit though for many of the articles dealers would have given a good price but at dealers mr potts drew the line not one of them had ever set a foot upon that oaken stair to the attics the place was filled with this furniture and other articles such as books china samplers with the glass broken and i know not what besides piled in heaps upon the floor indeed where mr potts slept was a mystery either it must have been under the counter in his shop or perhaps at nights he inhabited a worm eaten jacobean bedstead which stood in an attic for i observed a kind of pathway to it running through a number of legless chairs also some dirty blankets between the moth riddled curtains not far from this bedstead propped in an intoxicated way against the sloping wall of the old house stood the clock which i desired it was one of the first regulator clocks with a wooden pendulum used by the maker himself to check the time keeping of all his other clocks and enclosed in a chaste and perfect mahogany case of the very best style of its period so beautiful was it indeed that it had been an instance of love at first sight between us and although there was an estrangement on the matter of settlements or in other words over the question of price now i felt that never more could that clock and i be parted so i agreed to give old potts the or to be accurate s which he asked on the per cent rise principle thankful in my heart that he had not made it more and prepared to go as i

eugenics itself in large quantities or small coming quickly or coming slowly urged from good motives or bad applied to a thousand people or applied to three eugenics itself is a thing no more to be bargained about than poisoning it is not really difficult to sum up the essence of eugenics though some of the eugenists seem to be rather vague about it the movement consists of two parts a moral basis which is common to all and a scheme of social application which varies a good deal for the moral basis it is obvious that man s ethical responsibility varies with his knowledge of consequences if i were in charge of a baby like dr johnson in that tower of vision and if the baby was ill through having eaten the soap i might possibly send for a doctor i might be calling him away from much more serious cases from the bedsides of babies whose diet had been far more deadly but i should be justified i could not be expected to know enough about his other patients to be obliged or even entitled to sacrifice to them the baby for whom i was primarily and directly responsible now the eugenic moral basis is this that the baby for whom we are primarily and directly responsible is the babe unborn that is that we know or may come to know enough of certain inevitable tendencies in biology to consider the fruit of some contemplated union in that direct and clear light of conscience which we can now only fix on the other partner in that union the one duty can conceivably be as definite as or more definite than the other the baby that does not exist can be considered even before the wife who does now it is essential to grasp that this is a comparatively new note in morality of course sane people always thought the aim of marriage was the procreation of children to the glory of god or according to the plan of nature but whether they counted such children as god s reward for service or nature s premium on sanity they always left the reward to god or the premium to nature as a less definable thing the only person and this is the point towards whom one could have precise duties was the partner in the process directly considering the partner s claims was the nearest one could get to indirectly considering the claims of posterity if the women of the harem sang praises of the hero as the moslem mounted his horse it was because this was the due of a man if the christian knight helped his wife off her horse it was because this was the due of a woman definite and detailed dues of this kind they did not predicate of the babe unborn regarding him in that agnostic and opportunist light in which mr browdie regarded the hypothetical child of miss squeers thinking these sex relations healthy they naturally hoped they would produce healthy children but that was all the moslem woman doubtless expected allah to send beautiful sons to an obedient wife but she would not have allowed any direct vision of such sons to alter the obedience itself she would not have said i will now be a disobedient wife as the learned leech informs me that great prophets are often the children of disobedient wives the knight doubtless hoped that the saints would help him to strong children if he did all the duties of his station one of which might be helping his wife off her horse but he would not have refrained from doing this because he had read in a book that a course of falling off horses often resulted in the birth of a genius both moslem and christian would have thought such speculations not only impious but utterly unpractical i quite agree with them but that is not the point here the point here is that a new school believes eugenics against ethics and it is proved by one familiar fact that the heroisms of history are actually the crimes of eugenics the eugenists books and articles are full of suggestions that non eugenic unions should and may come to be regarded as we regard sins that we should really feel that marrying an invalid is a kind of cruelty to children but history is full of the praises of people who have held sacred such ties to invalids of cases like those of colonel hutchinson and sir william temple who remained faithful to betrothals when beauty and health had been apparently blasted and though the illnesses of dorothy osborne and mrs hutchinson may not fall under the eugenic speculations i do not know it is obvious that they might have done so and certainly it would not have made any difference to men s moral opinion of the act i do not discuss here which morality i favour but i insist that they are opposite the eugenist really sets up as saints the very men whom hundreds of families have called sneaks to be consistent they ought to put up statues to the men who deserted their loves because of bodily misfortune with inscriptions celebrating the good eugenist who on his fianc e falling off a bicycle nobly refused to marry her or to the young hero who on hearing of an uncle with erysipelas magnanimously broke his word what is perfectly plain is this that mankind have hitherto held the bond between man and woman so sacred and the effect of it on the children so incalculable that they have always admired the maintenance of honour more than the maintenance of safety doubtless they thought that even the children might be none the worse for not being the children of cowards and shirkers but this was not the first thought the first commandment briefly we may say that while many moral systems have set restraints on sex almost as severe as any eugenist could set they have almost always had the character of securing the fidelity of the two sexes to each other and leaving the rest to god to introduce an ethic which makes that fidelity or infidelity vary with some

gold clasped the garment about her waist so that the upper portion fell outward over the girdle after the manner of a blouse in the girdle was a long dagger of beautiful workmanship dainty sandals encased her feet while a wimple of violet silk bordered in gold fringe lay becomingly over her head and shoulders by her side walked a handsome boy of about three clad like his companion in gay colors his tiny surcoat of scarlet velvet was rich with embroidery while beneath was a close fitting tunic of white silk his doublet was of scarlet while his long hose of white were cross gartered with scarlet from his tiny sandals to his knees on the back of his brown curls sat a flat brimmed round crowned hat in which a single plume of white waved and nodded bravely at each move of the proud little head the child s features were well molded and his frank bright eyes gave an expression of boyish generosity to a face which otherwise would have been too arrogant and haughty for such a mere baby as he talked with his companion little flashes of peremptory authority and dignity which sat strangely upon one so tiny caused the young woman at times to turn her head from him that he might not see the smiles which she could scarce repress presently the boy took a ball from his tunic and pointing at a little bush near them said stand you there lady maud by yonder bush i would play at toss

is almost the normal state with whole classes of intelligent people intelligent i say the others always have been casual and adventurous and always will be a loss of confidence in the general

the sense of secrecy dark with low little windows sunk into the earth dark like a lair where strong beasts had lurked and mated lonely at night and lonely by day left to themselves and their own intensity for so many generations it seemed to cast a spell on the two young people they became different there was a curious secret glow about them a certain slumbering flame hard to understand that enveloped them both they too felt that they did not belong to the london world any more crockham had changed their blood the sense of the snakes that lived and slept even in their own garden in the sun so that he going forward with the spade would see a curious coiled brownish pile on the black soil which suddenly would start up hiss and dazzle rapidly away hissing one day winifred heard the strangest scream from the flower bed under the low window of the living room ah the strangest scream like the very soul of the dark past crying aloud she ran out and saw a long brown snake on the flower bed and in its flat mouth the one hind leg of a frog was striving to escape and screaming its strange tiny bellowing scream she looked at the snake and from its sullen flat head it looked at her obstinately she gave a cry and it released the frog and slid angrily away that was crockham the spear of modern invention had not passed through it and it lay there secret primitive savage as when the saxons first came and egbert and she were caught there caught out of the world he was not idle nor was she there were plenty of things to be done the house to be put into final repair after the workmen had gone cushions and curtains to sew the paths to make the water to fetch and attend to and then the slope of the deep soiled neglected garden to level to terrace with little terraces and paths and to fill with flowers he worked away in his shirt sleeves worked all day intermittently doing this thing and the other and she quiet and rich in herself seeing him stooping and labouring away by himself would come to help him to be near him he of course was an amateur a born amateur he worked so hard and did so little and nothing he ever did would hold together for long if he terraced the garden he held up the earth with a couple of long narrow planks that soon began to bend with the pressure from behind and would not need many years to rot through and break and let the soil slither all down again in a heap towards the stream bed but there you are he had not been brought up to come to grips with anything and he thought it would do nay he did not think there was anything else except little temporary contrivances possible he who had such a passion for his old enduring cottage and for the old enduring things of the bygone england curious that the sense of permanency in the past had such a hold over him whilst in the present he was all amateurish and sketchy winifred could not criticize him town bred everything seemed to her splendid and the very digging and shovelling itself seemed romantic but neither egbert nor she yet realized the difference between work and romance godfrey marshall her father was at first perfect\", \"target\": 4, \"compound\": 0.9991, \"neg\":

in audience this morning nay i know not caradoc and regnus and celticus the icenian who like so many of the richer britons have been educated at rome and who would lay before me their plans as to the ruling of this country and what is their plan that they themselves should do it the roman soldier laughed well they will have their will said he as he saluted and turned upon his heel farewell your excellency there are hard days coming for you and for me an hour later the british deputation was ushered into the presence of the governor they were good steadfast men men who with a whole heart and at some risk to themselves had taken up their country s cause so far as they could see it at the same time they well knew that under the mild and beneficent rule of rome it was only when they passed from words to deeds that their backs or their necks would be in danger they stood now earnest and a little abashed before the throne of the viceroy celticus was a swarthy black bearded little iberian caradoc and regnus were tall middle aged men of the fair flaxen british type all three were dressed in the draped yellow toga after the latin fashion instead of in the brac and tunic which distinguished their more insular fellow countrymen well asked the governor we are here said celticus boldly as the spokesmen of a great number of our fellow countrymen for the purpose of sending our petition through you to the emperor and to the roman senate that we may urge upon them the policy of allowing us to govern this country after our own ancient fashion he paused as if awaiting some outburst as an answer to his own temerity but the governor merely nodded his head as a sign that he should proceed we had laws of our own before ever c sar set foot in britain which have served their purpose since first our forefathers came from the land of ham we are not a child among the nations but our history goes back in our own traditions further even than that of rome and we are galled by this yoke which you have laid upon us are not our laws just asked the governor the code of c sar is just but it is always the code of c sar our own laws were made for our own uses and our own circumstances and we would fain have them again you speak roman as if you had been bred in the forum you wear a roman toga your hair is filleted in roman fashion are not these the gifts of rome we would take all the learning and all the arts that rome or greece could give but we would still be britain and ruled by britons the viceroy smiled by the rood of saint helena said he had you spoken thus to some of my heathen ancestors there would have been an end to your politics that you have dared to stand before my face and say as much is a proof for ever of the gentleness of our rule but i would reason with you for a moment upon this your request you know well that this land has never been one kingdom but was always under many chiefs and many tribes who have made war upon each other would you in very truth have it so again those were in the evil pagan days the days of the druid and the oak grove your excellency but now we are held together by a gospel of peace the viceroy shook his head if all the world were of the same way of thinking then it would be easier said he it may be that this blessed doctrine of peace will be little help to you when you are face to face with strong men who still worship the god of war what would you do against the picts of the north your excellency knows that many of the bravest legionaries are of british blood these are our defence but discipline man the power to command the knowledge of war the strength to act it is in these things that you would fail too long have you leaned upon the crutch the times may be hard but when we have

adequate or effective treatment i had again and again felt for most of the distinctively social aspects of london the general artlessly histrionised air of things caused so many examples to spring from behind any hedge what came up however at once for my own stretched canvas was that it would have to be ample give me really space to turn round and that a single illustrative case might easily be meagre fare the young man who should chuck admired politics and of course some other admired object with them would be all very well but he wouldn t be enough therefore what should one say to some other young man who would chuck something and somebody else admired in their way too there need never at the worst be any difficulty about the things advantageously chuckable for art the question is all but of choosing them in the heap yet were i to represent a struggle an interesting one indispensably with the passions of the theatre as a profession or at least as an absorption i should have to place the theatre in another light than the satiric this however would by good luck be perfectly possible too without a sacrifice of truth and i should doubtless even be able to make my theatric case as important as i might desire it it seemed clear that i needed big cases small ones would practically give my central idea away and i make out now my still labouring under the illusion that the case of the sacrifice for art can ever be with truth with taste with discretion involved apparently and showily big i daresay it glimmered upon me even then that the very sharpest difficulty of the victim of the conflict i should seek to represent and the very highest interest of his predicament dwell deep in the fact that his repudiation of the great obvious great moral or functional or useful character shall just have to consent to resemble a surrender for absolutely nothing those characters are all large and expansive seated and established and endowed whereas the most charming truth about the preference for art is that to parade abroad so thoroughly inward and so naturally embarrassed a matter is to falsify and vulgarise it that as a preference attended with the honours of publicity it is indeed nowhere that in fact under the rule of its sincerity its only honours are those of contradiction concentration and a seemingly deplorable indifference to everything but itself nothing can well figure as less big in an honest thesis than a marked instance of somebody s willingness to pass mainly for an ass of these things i must i say have been in strictness aware what i perhaps failed of was to note that if a certain romantic glamour even that of mere eccentricity or of a fine perversity may be flung over the act of exchange of a career for the esthetic life in general the prose and the modesty of the matter yet come in with any exhibition of the particular branch of esthetics selected then it is that the attitude of hero or heroine may look too much for the romantic effect like a low crouching over proved trifles art indeed has in our day taken on so many honours and emoluments that the recognition of its importance is more than a custom has become on occasion almost a fury the line is drawn especially in the english world only at the importance of heeding what it may mean the more i turn my pieces over at any rate the more i now see i must have found in them and i remember how once well in presence of my three typical examples my fear of too ample a canvas quite dropped the only question was that if i had marked my political case from so far back for a story by itself and then marked my theatrical case for another the joining together of these interests originally seen as separate might all disgracefully betray the seam show for mechanical and superficial a story was a story a picture a picture and i had a mortal horror of two stories two pictures in one the reason of this was the clearest my subject was immediately under that disadvantage so cheated of its indispensable centre as to become of no more use for expressing a main intention than a wheel without a hub is of use for moving a cart it was a fact apparently that one had on occasion seen two pictures in one were there not for instance certain sublime tintorettos at venice a measureless crucifixion in especial which showed without loss of authority half a dozen actions separately taking place yes that might be but there had surely been nevertheless a mighty pictorial fusion so that the virtue of composition had somehow thereby come all mysteriously to its own of course the affair would be simple enough if composition could be kept out of the question yet by what art or process what bars and bolts what unmuzzled dogs and pointed guns perform that feat i had to know myself utterly inapt for any such valour and recognise that to make it possible sundry things should have begun for me much further back than i had felt them even in their dawn a picture without composition slights its most precious chance for beauty and is moreover not composed at all unless the painter knows how that principle of health and safety working as an absolutely premeditated art has prevailed there may in its absence be life incontestably as the newcomes has life as les trois mousquetaires as tolstoi s peace and war have it but what do such large loose baggy monsters with their queer elements of the accidental and the arbitrary artistically mean we have heard it maintained we well remember that such things are superior to art but we understand least of

uses and to the harm and possibly the undoing of the king for years an inmate of the palace and often a listener in the armory when the king played at sword with his friends and favorites de vac had heard much which passed between henry iii and his intimates that could well be turned to the king s harm by a shrewd and resourceful enemy with all england he knew the utter contempt in which henry

golden bough it must have appeared to the ancient aryan that the sun was periodically recruited from the fire which resided in the sacred oak exactly the fire which resided in the tree of life that is life itself so we must read it must have appeared to the ancient aryan that the sun was periodically recruited from life which is what the early greek philosophers were always saying and which still seems to me the real truth the clue to the cosmos instead of life being drawn from the sun it is the emanation from life itself that is from all the living plants and creatures which nourish the sun

just the marvel of the unborn me one last weary little word this pseudo philosophy of mine pollyanalytics as one of my respected critics might say is deduced from the novels and poems not the reverse the novels and poems come unwatched out of one s pen and then the absolute need which one has for some sort of satisfactory mental attitude towards oneself and things in general makes one try to abstract some definite conclusions from one s experiences as a writer and as a man the novels and poems are pure passionate experience these pollyanalytics are inferences made afterwards from the experience and finally it seems to me that even art is utterly dependent on philosophy or if you prefer it on a metaphysic the metaphysic or philosophy may not be anywhere very accurately stated and may be quite unconscious in the artist yet it is a metaphysic that governs men at the time and is by all men more or less comprehended and lived men live and see according to some gradually developing and gradually withering vision this vision exists also as a dynamic idea or metaphysic exists first as such then it is unfolded into life and art our vision our belief our metaphysic is wearing

unexpected suffering in the tired face of the man who gazed out in somewhat dazed fashion at the little panorama which he had been looking forward so eagerly to seeing again throughout the long journey down from town he had felt an unusual and almost boyish enthusiasm for his coming holiday he had thought of his tennis racquet and fishing rods wondered about his golf clubs and his guns even

little hard and anxious now she wore a white dress simple with the simplicity of supreme and expensive art a rope of pearls was her only ornament her hair was somewhat elaborately coiffured there was a touch of rouge upon her cheeks and the unscreened evening sunlight was scarcely kind to her rather wan features and carefully arranged complexion she still had her claims to beauty however tallente admitted that to himself as he stood there appraising her with a strange and almost impersonal regard his wife of thirteen years she was beautiful notwithstanding the strained look of anxiety which at that moment disfigured her face the lurking fear which made her voice sound artificial the nervousness which every moment made fresh demands upon her self restraint it came up from the sea she said one moment tony and i were sitting out under the trees to keep away from the sun and the next we were driven shivering indoors it was just like running into a fog bank in the middle of the atlantic on a hot summer s day i found the difference in temperature amazing he observed i too dropped from the sunshine into a strange chill she tried to get rid of the subject so you lost your seat she said i am very sorry tell me how it happened he shrugged his shoulders the democratic party made up their mind for some reason or other that i shouldn t sit the labour party generally were not thinking of running a candidate i was to have been returned unopposed in acknowledgment of my work on the nationalisation bill the democrats however ratted they put up a man at the last moment and well you know

about the future my plans are not wholly made for the first time an old and passionate ambition prevailed against the thrall of the moment one of the papers this morning she said eagerly suggested that you might be offered a peerage i saw it he acknowledged it was in the sun i was once unfortunate enough to be on the committee of a club which blackballed the editor her mouth hardened a little

except once when mrs smith went into the house and then he knocked panhandle down for once panhandle did not squall he got up round eyed pale with his hands clenched he never said a word something was born in the depths of his gentle soul then dick tore a hole in the little wall of rocks that supported the porch and with a lighted torch on a stick he wormed his way in to rout out the skunks

and terrible was it dick s eyes were shut for the time being he had been blinded he bounced around like a chicken with its head cut off bawling wildly what had happened panhandle did not know but it certainly suited him goody goody he shouted holding his nose and edging away from the lad then panhandle saw smoke issuing from the hole under the porch the mother skunk and her kittens scampered out

could be done panhandle stood crying beside his mother watching their little home burn to the ground somehow in his mind the boy dick had been to blame panhandle peered round to find him but he was gone never would panhandle forget that boy they walked to the uncle s house and spent the night there soon another home was under construction on the same site it was more of a shack than a house for building materials were scarce and the near approach of winter made hasty construction imperative winter came soon and panhandle and his mother were alone it was cold and they huddled over the little wood fire they had plenty to eat but were very uncomfortable in the one room shack bill smith came home but seldom that fall the valley had been overrun with homesteaders nesters they were called and these newcomers passed by often from the town drunk and rough panhandle used to lie awake a good deal during these lonely hours the moan of the prairie wind the mourn of wolves and yelp of coyotes became part of his existence he understood why his mother barred and blocked the one door placed the ax by the bed and the gun under her pillow even then he longed for the time when he would be old and big enough to protect her the lonely winter with its innumerable hours of solitude for mrs smith and the boy had incalculable influence upon his character she taught him much ways and things words and feelings that became an integral part of his life at last the long winter ended with spring came the gales of wind which though no longer cold were terrible in their violence many a night panhandle lay awake shrinking beside his mother fearing the shack would blow away over their heads many a day the sun was obscured and nothing could be cooked no work done while the dust storm raged as spring advanced with a lessening of the tornadoes a new and fascinating game came into panhandle s life it was to sit at the one little window and watch the cowboys ride by how he came to worship them they were on their way to the spring roundups his father had told him all about them panhandle would strain his eyes to get a first glimpse of them to count the shaggy prancing horses the lithe supple riders with their great sombreros their bright scarfs guns and chaps and boots and spurs their lassos how they fascinated panhandle ropes to whirl and throw at a running steer that was a game he resolved to play when he grew up and his mother discovering his interest made him a little reata and taught him how to throw it how to make loops and knots she told him how her people had owned horses thrown lassos run cattle panhandle was always watching for the cowboys when they passed by he would run to the other side of the shack where there was a knothole stuffed with a rag and through this he would peep until he was blinded by dust these were full days for the lad rousing in him wonder and awe eagerness and fear strange longings for he knew not what then one day his father brought

thousand people or applied to three eugenics itself is a thing no more to be bargained about than poisoning it is not really difficult to sum up the essence of eugenics though some of the eugenists seem to be rather vague about it the movement consists of two parts a moral basis which is common to all and a scheme of social application which varies a good deal for the moral basis it is obvious that man s ethical responsibility varies with his knowledge of consequences if i were in charge of a baby like dr johnson in that tower of vision and if the baby was ill through having eaten the soap i might possibly send for a doctor i might be calling him away from much more serious cases from the bedsides of babies whose diet had been far more deadly but i should be justified i could not be expected to know enough about his other patients to be obliged or even entitled to sacrifice to them the baby for whom i was primarily and directly responsible now the eugenic moral basis is this that the baby for whom we are primarily and directly responsible is the babe unborn that is that we know or may come to know enough of certain inevitable tendencies in biology to consider the fruit of some contemplated union in that direct and clear light of conscience which we can now only fix on the other partner in that union the one duty can conceivably be as definite as or more definite than the other the baby that does not exist can be considered even before the wife who does now it is essential to grasp that this is a comparatively new note in morality of course sane people always thought the aim of marriage was the procreation of children to the glory of god or according to the plan of nature but whether they counted such children as god s reward for service or nature s premium on sanity they always left the reward to god or the premium to nature as a less definable thing the only person and this is the point towards whom one could have precise duties was the partner in the process directly considering the partner s claims was the nearest one could get to indirectly considering the claims of posterity if the women of the harem sang praises of the hero as the moslem mounted his horse it was because this was the due of a man if the christian knight helped his wife off her horse it was because this was the due of a woman definite and detailed dues of this kind they did not predicate of the babe unborn regarding him in that agnostic and opportunist light in which mr browdie regarded the hypothetical child of miss squeers thinking these sex relations healthy they naturally hoped they would produce healthy children but that was all the moslem woman doubtless expected allah to send beautiful sons to an obedient wife but she would not have allowed any direct vision of such sons to alter the obedience itself she would not have said i will now be a disobedient wife as the learned leech informs me that great prophets are often the children of disobedient wives the knight doubtless hoped that the saints would help him to strong children if he did all the duties of his station one of which might be helping his wife off her horse but he would not have refrained from doing this because he had read in a book that a course of falling off horses often resulted in the birth of a genius both moslem and christian would have thought such speculations not only impious but utterly unpractical i quite agree with them but that is not the point here the point here is that a new school believes eugenics against ethics and it is proved by one familiar fact that the heroisms of history are actually the crimes of eugenics the eugenists books and articles are full of suggestions that non eugenic unions should and may come to be regarded as we regard sins that we should really feel that marrying an invalid is a kind of cruelty to children but history is full of the praises of people who have held sacred such ties to invalids of cases like those of colonel hutchinson and sir william temple who remained faithful to betrothals when beauty and health had been apparently blasted and though the illnesses of dorothy osborne and mrs hutchinson may not fall under the eugenic speculations i do not know it is obvious that they might have done so and certainly it would not have made any difference to men s moral opinion of the act i do not discuss here which morality i favour but i insist that they are opposite the eugenist really sets up as saints the very men whom hundreds of families have called sneaks to be consistent they ought to put up statues to the men who deserted their loves because of bodily misfortune with inscriptions celebrating the good eugenist who on his fianc e falling off a bicycle nobly refused to marry her or to the young hero who on hearing of an uncle with erysipelas magnanimously broke his word what is perfectly plain is this that mankind have hitherto held the bond between man and woman so sacred and the effect of it on the children so incalculable that they have always admired the maintenance of honour more than the maintenance of safety doubtless they thought that even the children might be none the

of icarus icarus flew this icarus is going to fly one of these days sherikov shrugged you can examine him if you want i suppose this is what you came here to see reinhart advanced slowly this is the

relay banks reinhart caught a glimpse of endless tubes and filaments a maze of wires and terminals and parts criss crossing each other layer on layer what is it reinhart perched on the edge of a workbench leaning his big shoulders against the wall an idea of jamison hedge the same man who developed our instantaneous interstellar vidcasts forty years ago he was trying to find a method of faster than light travel when he was killed destroyed along with most of his work after that ftl research was abandoned it looked as if there were no future in it wasn t it shown that nothing could travel faster than light the interstellar vidcasts do no hedge developed a valid ftl drive he managed to propel an object at fifty times the speed of light but as the object gained speed its length began to diminish and its mass increased this was in line with familiar twentieth century concepts of mass energy transformation we conjectured that as hedge s object gained velocity it would continue to lose length and gain mass until its length became nil and its mass infinite nobody can imagine such an object go on but what actually occurred is this hedge s object continued to lose length and gain mass until it reached the theoretical limit of velocity the speed of light at that point the object still gaining speed simply ceased to exist having no length it ceased to occupy space it disappeared however the object had not been destroyed it continued on its way gaining momentum each moment moving in an arc across the galaxy away from the sol system hedge s object entered some other realm of being beyond our powers of conception the next phase of hedge s experiment consisted in a search for some way to slow the ftl object down back to a sub ftl speed hence back into our universe this counterprinciple was eventually worked out with what result the death of hedge and destruction of most of his equipment his experimental object in re entering the space time universe came into being in space already occupied by matter possessing an incredible mass just below infinity level hedge s object exploded in a titanic cataclysm it was obvious that no space travel was possible with such a drive virtually all space contains some matter to re enter space would bring automatic destruction hedge had found his ftl drive and his counterprinciple but no one before this has been able to put them to any use reinhart walked over toward the great metal cylinder sherikov jumped down and followed him i don t get it reinhart said you said the principle is no good for space travel that s right what s this for then if the ship explodes as soon as it returns to our universe this is not a ship sherikov grinned slyly icarus is the first practical application of hedge s principles icarus is a bomb so this is our weapon reinhart said a bomb an immense bomb a bomb moving at a velocity greater than light a bomb which will not exist in our universe the centaurans won t be able to detect or stop it how could they as soon as it passes the speed of light it will cease to exist beyond all detection but icarus will be launched outside the lab on the surface he will align himself with proxima centaurus gaining speed rapidly by the time he reaches his destination he will be traveling at ftl icarus will be brought back to this universe within centaurus itself the explosion should destroy the star and wash away most of its planets including their central hub planet armun there is no way they can halt icarus once he has been launched no defense is possible nothing can stop him it is a real fact when will he be ready sherikov s eyes flickered soon exactly how soon the big pole hesitated as a matter of fact there s only one thing holding us back sherikov led reinhart around to the other side of the lab he pushed a lab guard out of the way see this he tapped a round globe open at one end the size of a grapefruit this is holding us up what is it the central control turret this thing brings icarus back to sub ftl flight at the correct moment it must be absolutely accurate icarus will be within the star only a matter of a microsecond if the turret does not function exactly icarus will pass out the other side and shoot beyond the centauran system how near completed is this turret sherikov hedged\", \"target\": 5, \"compound\": -0.989, \"neg\": 0.101, \"neu\":

really spoke to them as i speak to you at least in a sense they can project thoughts i gathered that must be so from your letter how i wonder i could not say i asked them and of course they were vague or perhaps it was just that i could not understand it involves a projector for the focussing of thought and even more than that conscious attention on the part of both projector and receptor it was quite a while before i realized they were trying to think at me such thought projectors may be part of the science they will give us perhaps said the industrialist yet think of the changes it would

odysseus a figure common to the mythology of most self conscious races as i interpret it odysseus wanders as an individual aware of himself as such this is the idea of separation of separation from family and country the process of individuation but odysseus returns to his home peterson looked out the port window at the stars endless stars burning intently in the empty universe finally he goes home as must all creatures the moment of separation is a temporary period a brief journey of the soul it begins it ends the wanderer returns to land and race the door opened the wub stopped turning

bright and silvery she didn t know why but somehow she felt she wasn t in the least afraid of him i suppose one ought to be repelled at once by a snake she said taking the opposite seat and keeping her glance fixed firmly upon the reptile s eye but then this is such a handsome one i can t say why but i don t feel afraid of him at all as i ought to do every right minded person detests snakes don t they and yet how exquisitely flexible and beautiful he is oh pray don t put him back in his box for me he s basking in the sun here i should be sorry to disturb him cyril waring looked at her in considerable surprise he caught the creature in his hands as he spoke and transferred it at once to a tin box with a perforated lid that lay beside him go back sardanapalus he said in a very musical

him elma answered slipping her change into her pocket and looking prettier through her blush than even her usual self on the contrary i really liked to see him he s such a glorious snake the lights and shades on his back are so glancing and so wonderful he s a perfect model of course you re painting him the stranger started i m painting him yes that s true he replied with a look of sudden surprise but why of course please how on earth could you tell i was an artist even elma glanced back in his face and wondered to herself too now she came to think of it how did she know that handsome young man with the charming features and the expressive eyes and the neatly cut brown beard and the attractive manner was an artist at all or anything like it and how did she know the snake was his model for the life of her she couldn t have answered those questions herself i suppose i just guessed it she answered after a short pause blushing still more deeply at the sudden way she had thus been dragged into conversation with the good looking stranger elma s skin was dark a clear and creamy olive brown complexion such as one sometimes sees in southern europe though rarely in england and the effect of the blush through it didn t pass unnoticed by cyril waring s artistic eye he would have given something for the chance of transferring that delicious effect to canvas the delicate transparency of the blush threw up those piercing dark eyes and reflected lustre even on the glossy black hair that fringed her forehead not an english type of beauty at all elma clifford s he thought to himself as he eyed her closely rather spanish or italian or say even hungarian well you guessed right at any rate he went on settling down in his seat once more after boxing his snake but this time face to face with her i m working at a beautiful bit of fern and foliage quite tropical in its way in a wood hereabout and i ve introduced sardanapalus coiled up in the foreground just to give life to the scene don t you know and an excuse for a title i mean to call it the rajah s rest behind great ferns and a mossy bank in front sardanapalus after tiffin rolled spirally round and taking his siesta this meeting was a long wished for occasion elma had never before met a real live painter now it was the cherished idea of her youth to see something some day of that wonderful non existent fantastic world which we still hope for and dream about and call bohemia she longed to move in literary and artistic circles she had fashioned to herself like many other romantic girls a rose coloured picture of bohemian existence not knowing indeed that bohemia is now alas an extinct province since belgravia and kensington swallowed it bodily down digested and assimilated it so this casual talk with the handsome young artist in the second class carriage on the great southern line was to elma as a charming and delightful glimpse of an enchanted region she could never enter it was paradise to the peri she turned the conversation at once therefore with resolute intent upon art and artists determined to make the most while it lasted of this unique opportunity and since the subject of self with an attentive listener is always an attractive one even to modest young men like cyril waring especially when it s a pretty girl who encourages you to dilate upon it why the consequence was that before many minutes were over the handsome young man was discoursing from his full heart to a sympathetic soul about his chosen art its hopes and its ideals accompanied by a running fire of thumb nail illustrations he had even got so far in the course of their intimacy as to take out the portfolio which lay hidden under the seat out of deference to his disguise as a stock broker no doubt and to display before elma s delighted eyes with many explanatory comments as to light and shade or perspective and foreshortening the studies for the picture he had just then engaged upon by and by as his

lifted his fieldglasses the russian lines were a few miles ahead of him they had a forward command post there the runner had come from it a squat robot with undulating arms passed by him its arms
