godliness which made him next to alfred the great the first monarch who ever sat on the english throne two years after dryden came to london cromwell expired and the poet wrote and published his heroic stanzas on the hero s death which we consider really his earliest poem when richard resigned dryden in common with the majority of the nation saw that the roundhead cause was lost and hastened to carry over his talents to the gaining side for this we do not blame him very severely although it certainly had been nobler if like milton he had clung to his party sir walter scott remarks that dryden never retracted the praise he gave to cromwell in absalom and achitophel he sneers at richard as ishbosheth but says nothing against the deceased giant saul it is clear too that at first his desertion of the cromwell party was a loss to the poet he lost the chance of their favour in case a reaction should come his situation as secretary and the shelter of pickering s princely mansion as might have been expected his ancient friends were indignant at the change and not less so at the alteration he thought proper at the same time to make in the spelling of his name from driden to dryden he went to reside in the obscure house of one herringman a bookseller in the new exchange and became for life a professional author his enemies afterwards reproached him bitterly for his mean circumstances at this period of his life and asserted that he was a mere drudge to herringman he at all events did little in his own proper poetic calling for two years a poem on the coronation of charles well fitted to wipe away the stain of cromwellism and to attract upon the poet the eye of that rising sun whose glory he sang with more zeal than truth a panegyric on the lord chancellor and a satire on the dutch were all and are all short and all savour of a vein somewhat hide bound he planned indeed too and partly wrote one or more plays and was considered of consequence enough to be elected a member of the royal society in previous to this he had been introduced through herringman to sir robert howard son of the first earl of berkshire and a relation of edward howard the author of british princes and the object of the witty wrath of butler sir robert too had a poetical propensity and dryden and he became and continued intimate for a number of years the poet assisting the knight in his literary compositions particularly in a play entitled the indian queen and the latter inviting the former to the family seat at charlton where dryden met in an unlucky hour his future wife lady elizabeth howard the sister of sir robert it was on the st of december in st swithin s london and with the consent of the earl who settled about a year on his daughter that this unhappy union took place the lady seems to have had absolutely none of the qualities which tend either to command a husband s respect or to conciliate his regard but is described as a woman of violent temper and weak understanding much of the bitterness of dryden s satire some of the coarse licentiousness of his plays and all the sarcasms at matrimony which he has scattered in multitudes throughout his works may be traced to his domestic unhappiness otherwise the match had some advantages it broke up for a time at least some licentious connexions he had formed particularly after a time one with mrs reeves the actress with whom having laid aside his norwich drugget he used to eat tarts at the mulberry gardens with a sword and a chadreux wig it secured to him including his own property an income of about a year a sum equal to now and which on the death of his mother three years later was increased by more or at the present value of money he was thus protected for life against the meaner and more miserable necessities of the literary man under which many of his unfortunate rivals were crushed and if he could not always command luxuries he was always sure of bread to improve his circumstances however and to enable him to keep up a style of living in unison with his lady s rank he must write and the question arose what mode of composition was likely to be the most lucrative were he to continue to indite panegyrical verses like those to clarendon he stood a chance of having a few guineas tossed to him now and then by a patron like a crust to an unfortunate cur were he to translate or write prefaces for the booksellers he might pay his bill for salt if diligent enough for satires as yet there was little demand the follies of the more fanatical of the puritans were too

wife lady elizabeth howard the sister of sir robert it was on the st of december in st swithin s london and with the consent of the earl who settled about a year on his daughter that this unhappy union took place the lady seems to have had absolutely none of the qualities which tend either to command a husband s respect or to conciliate his regard but is described as a woman of violent temper and weak understanding much of the bitterness of dryden s satire some of the coarse licentiousness of his plays and all the sarcasms at matrimony which he has scattered in multitudes throughout his works may be traced to his domestic unhappiness otherwise the match had some advantages it broke up for a time at least some licentious connexions he had formed particularly after a time one with mrs reeves the actress with whom having laid aside his norwich drugget he used to eat tarts at the mulberry gardens with a sword and a chadreux wig it secured to him including his own property an income of about a year a sum equal to now and which on the death of his mother three years later was increased by more or at the present value of money he was thus protected for life against the meaner and more miserable necessities of the literary man under which many of his unfortunate rivals were crushed and if he could not always command luxuries he was always sure of bread to improve his circumstances however and to enable him to keep up a style of living in unison with his lady s rank he must write and the question arose what mode of composition was likely to be the most lucrative were he to continue to indite panegyrical verses like those to clarendon he stood a chance of having a few guineas tossed to him now and then by a patron like a crust to an unfortunate cur were he to

with his father and grandfather that charles the second was not content with saying witty things about his philosophers but did wise things with regard to them for he not only bestowed upon them such attention as he could spare from his poodles and his mistresses but being in his usual state of impecuniosity begged for them of the duke of ormond and that step being without effect gave them chelsea college a charter and a mace crowning his favours in the best way they could be crowned by burdening them no further with royal patronage or state interference thus it was that the half dozen young men studious of the new philosophy who met in one another s lodgings in oxford or in london in the middle of the seventeenth century grew in numerical and in real strength until in the latter part the royal society for the improvement of natural knowledge had already become famous and had acquired a claim upon the veneration of englishmen which it has ever since retained as the principal focus of scientific activity in our islands and the chief champion of the cause it was formed to support it was by the aid of the royal society that newton published his principia if all the books in the world except the philosophical transactions were destroyed it is safe to say that the foundations of physical science would remain unshaken and that the vast intellectual progress of the last two centuries would be largely though incompletely recorded nor have any signs of halting or of decrepitude manifested themselves in our own times as in dr wallis s days so in these our business is precluding theology and state affairs to discourse and consider of philosophical enquiries but our mathematick is one which newton would have to go to school to learn our staticks mechanicks magneticks chymicks and natural experiments constitute a mass of physical and chemical knowledge a glimpse at which would compensate galileo for the doings of a score of inquisitorial cardinals our physick and anatomy have embraced such infinite varieties of being have laid open such new worlds in time and space have grappled not unsuccessfully with such complex problems that the eyes of vesalius and of harvey might be dazzled by the sight of the tree that has grown out of their grain of mustard seed the fact is perhaps rather too much than too little forced upon one s notice nowadays that all this marvellous intellectual growth has a no less wonderful expression in practical life and that in this respect if in no other the movement symbolized by the progress of the royal society stands without a parallel in the history of mankind a series of volumes as bulky as the transactions of the royal society might possibly be filled with the subtle speculations of the schoolmen not improbably the obtaining a mastery over the products of mediaeval thought might necessitate an even greater expenditure of time and of energy than the acquirement of the new philosophy but though such work engrossed the best intellects of europe for a longer time than has elapsed since the great fire its effects were writ in water so far as our social state is concerned on the other hand if the noble first president of the royal society could revisit the upper air and once more gladden his eyes with a sight of the familiar mace he would find himself in the midst of a material civilization more different from that of his day than that of the seventeenth was from that of the first century and if lord brouncker s native sagacity had not deserted his ghost he would need no long reflection to discover that all these great ships these railways these telegraphs these factories these printing presses without which the whole fabric of modern english society would collapse into a mass of stagnant and starving pauperism that all these pillars of our state are but the ripples and the bubbles upon the surface of that great spiritual stream the springs of which only he and his fellows were privileged to see and seeing to recognise as that which it behoved them above all things to keep pure and undefiled it may not be too great a flight of imagination to conceive our noble revenant not forgetful of the great troubles of his own day and anxious to know how often london had been burned down since his time and how often the plague had carried off its thousands he would have to learn that although london contains tenfold the inflammable matter that it did in though not content with filling our rooms with woodwork and light draperies we must needs lead inflammable and explosive gases into every corner of our streets and houses we never allow even a street to burn down and if he asked how this had come about we should have to explain that the improvement of natural knowledge has furnished us with dozens of machines for throwing water upon fires any one of which would have furnished the ingenious mr hooke the first curator and experimenter of the royal society with ample materials for discourse before half a dozen meetings of that body and that to say truth except for the progress of natural knowledge we should not have been able to make even the tools by which these machines are constructed and further it would be necessary to add that although severe fires sometimes occur and inflict great damage the loss is very generally compensated by societies the operations of which have been rendered possible only by the progress of natural knowledge in the direction of mathematics and the accumulation of wealth in virtue of other natural knowledge but the plague my lord brouncker s observation would not i fear lead him to think that englishmen of the nineteenth century are purer in life or more fervent in religious faith than the generation which could produce a

wife lady elizabeth howard the sister of sir robert it was on the st of december in st swithin s london and with the consent of the earl who settled about a year on his daughter that this unhappy union took place the lady seems to have had absolutely none of the qualities which tend either to command a husband s respect or to conciliate his regard but is described as a woman of violent temper and weak understanding much of the bitterness of dryden s satire some of the coarse licentiousness of his plays and all the sarcasms at matrimony which he has scattered in multitudes throughout his works may be traced to his domestic unhappiness otherwise the match had some advantages it broke up for a time at least some licentious connexions he had formed particularly after a time one with mrs reeves the actress with whom having laid aside his norwich drugget he used to eat tarts at the mulberry gardens with a sword and a chadreux wig it secured to him including his own property an income of about a year a sum equal to now and which on the death of his mother three years later was increased by more or at the present value of money he was thus protected for life against the meaner and more miserable necessities of the literary man under which many of his unfortunate rivals were crushed and if he could not always command luxuries he was always sure of bread to improve his circumstances however and to enable him to keep up a style of living in unison with his lady s rank he must write and the question arose what mode of composition was likely to be the most lucrative were he to continue to indite panegyrical verses like those to clarendon he stood a chance of having a few guineas tossed to him now and then by a patron like a crust to an unfortunate cur were he to translate or write prefaces for the booksellers he might pay his bill for salt if diligent enough for satires as yet there was little demand the follies of the more fanatical of the puritans were too recent although they were beginning to ripen for the hand of butler and the far grosser absurdities of the cavaliers were yet in blossom there remained nothing for an aspiring author but the stage which during the previous regime had been abolished while the french revolution was in progress ay even in the depths of the reign of terror the theatres were all open and all crowded but when cromwell was enacting his solemn and solitary part before god angels and men the petty potentates the gods and goddesses of the stage vanished into thin air at his tremendous stamp their cue had been

any straining for effect any of that double double toil and trouble by which many even of the weird cauldrons in which genius forms her creations are disturbed and bedimmed that power of doing everything with perfect and conscious ease which dugald stewart has ascribed to barrow and to horsley in prose distinguished dryden in poetry whether he discusses the deep questions of fate and foreknowledge in religio laici or lashes shaftesbury in the medal or pours a torrent of contempt on shadwell in macflecknoe or describes the fire of london in the annus mirabilis or soars into lyric enthusiasm in his ode on the death of mrs killigrew and alexander s feast or paints a tournament in palamon and arcite or a fairy dance in the flower and the leaf he is always at home and always aware that he is his consciousness of his own powers amounts to exultation he is like the steed who glories in that tremendous gallop which affects the spectator with fear indeed we never can separate our conception of dryden s vigorous and vaulting style from the image of a noble horse devouring the dust of the field clearing obstacles at a bound taking up long leagues as a little thing and the very strength and speed of whose motion give it at a distance the appearance of smoothness pope speaks of his long resounding march and energy divine perhaps ease divine had been words more characteristic of that almost superhuman power of language by which he makes the most obstinate materials pliant melts down difficulties as if by the touch of magic and to resume the former figure comes into the goal without a hair turned on his mane or a single sweat drop confessing effort or extraordinary exertion we know no poet since homer who can be compared to dryden in this respect except scott who occasionally in marmion and the lay of the last minstrel exhibits the same impetuous ease and fiery fluent movement scott does not however in general carry the same weight as the other and the species of verse he uses in comparison to the heroic rhyme of dryden gives you often the impression of a hard trot rather than of a long resounding and magnificent gallop scott exhibits in his poetry the soul of a warrior but it is of a warrior of the border somewhat savage and coarse dryden can for the nonce at least assume the appearance and display the spirit of a knight of ancient chivalry gallant accomplished elegant and gay next to this poet s astonishing ease spirit and elastic vigour may be ranked his clear sharp intellect he may be called more a logician than a poet he reasons often and always acutely and his rhyme instead of shackling strengthens the movement of his argumentation parts of his religio laici and the hind and panther resemble portions of duns scotus or aquinas set on fire indeed keen strong intellect inflamed with passion and inspirited by that ardour and impetuosity of mind which wordsworth is compelled to allow to him rather than creative or original genius is the differentia of dryden we have compared him to a courser but he was not one of those coursers of achilles who fed on no earthly food but on the golden barley of heaven having sprung from the gods greek xanthon kai balion to ama pnoiaesi petesthaen tous eteke zephuro anemo arpua podargae dryden resembled rather the mortal steed which was yoked with these immortal twain the brood of zephyr and the harpy podarga only we can hardly say of the poet what homer says of pedasus greek os kai thnaetos eon epeth ippois athanatoisi he was not although a mortal able to keep up with the immortal coursers his path was on the plains or table lands of earth never or seldom in cloudland gorgeous land or through the aerial altitudes which stretch away and above the clouds to the gates of heaven he can hardly be said to have possessed the power of sublimity in the high sense of that term as the power of sympathising with the feeling of the infinite often he gives us the impression of the picturesque of the beautiful of the heroic of the nobly disdainful but never when writing at least entirely from his own mind of that infinite and nameless grandeur which the imaginative soul feels shed on it from the multitudinous waves of ocean from the cataract leaping from his rock as if to consummate an act of prayer to god from the hum of great assemblies of men from the sight of far extended wastes and wildernesses and from the awful silence and the still more mysterious sparkle of the midnight stars this sense of the presence of the shadow of immensity immensity itself cannot be felt any more than measured this sight like that vouchsafed to moses of the backparts of the divine the divine itself cannot be seen has been the inspiration of all the highest poetry of the world of the paradise lost of the divina commedia of the night thoughts of wordsworth and coleridge of festus and highest far of the hebrew prophets as they cry whither can we go from thy presence whither can we flee from thy spirit such poets have resembled a blind man who feels although he cannot see that a stranger of commanding air is in the room beside him so they stand awe struck in the wind of the going of a majestic and unseen being this feeling differs from mysticism inasmuch as it is connected with a reality while the mystic dreams a vague and unsupported dream and the poetry it produces is simply the irresistible cry springing from the perception of this wondrous some one who is actually near them the feeling is connected in general with a lofty moral and religious nature and yet not always since while wanting in dryden we find it intensely discovered although in an imperfect and perverted shape in by,0

might have been expected his ancient friends were indignant at the change and not less so at the alteration he thought proper at the same time to make in the spelling of his name from driden to dryden he went to reside in the obscure house of one herringman a bookseller in the new exchange and became for life a professional author his enemies afterwards reproached him bitterly for his mean circumstances at this period of his life and asserted that he was a mere drudge to herringman he at all events did little in his own proper poetic calling for two years a poem on the coronation of

of british princes and the object of the witty wrath of butler sir robert too had a poetical propensity and dryden and he became and continued intimate for a number of years the poet assisting the

wife lady elizabeth howard the sister of sir robert it was on the st of december in st swithin s london and with the consent of the earl who settled about a year on his daughter that this unhappy union took place the lady seems to have had absolutely none of the qualities which tend either to command a husband s respect or to conciliate his regard but is described as a woman of violent temper and weak understanding much of the bitterness of dryden s satire some of the coarse licentiousness of his plays and all the sarcasms at matrimony which he has scattered in multitudes throughout his works may be traced to his domestic unhappiness otherwise the match had some advantages it broke up for a time at least some licentious connexions he had formed particularly after a time one with mrs reeves the actress with whom having laid aside his norwich drugget he used to eat tarts at the mulberry gardens with a sword and a chadreux wig it secured to him including his own property an income of about a year a sum equal to now and which on the death of his mother three years later was increased by more or at the present value of money he was thus protected for life against the meaner and more miserable necessities of the literary man under which many of his unfortunate rivals were crushed and if he could not always command luxuries he was always sure of bread to improve his circumstances however and to enable him to keep up a style of living in unison with his lady s rank he must write and the question arose what mode of composition was likely to be the most lucrative were he to continue to indite panegyrical verses like those to clarendon he stood a chance of having a few guineas tossed to him now and then by a patron like a crust to an unfortunate cur were he to

any straining for effect any of that double double toil and trouble by which many even of the weird cauldrons in which genius forms her creations are disturbed and bedimmed that power of doing everything with perfect and conscious ease which dugald stewart has ascribed to barrow and to horsley in prose distinguished dryden in poetry whether he discusses the deep questions of fate and foreknowledge in religio laici or lashes shaftesbury in the medal or pours a torrent of contempt on shadwell in macflecknoe or describes the fire of london in the annus mirabilis or soars into lyric enthusiasm in his ode on the death of mrs killigrew and alexander s feast or paints a tournament in palamon and arcite or a fairy dance in the flower and the leaf he is always at home and always aware that he is his consciousness of his own powers amounts to exultation he is like the steed who glories in that tremendous gallop which affects the spectator with fear indeed we never can separate our conception of dryden s vigorous and vaulting style from the image of a noble horse devouring the dust of the field clearing obstacles at a bound taking up long leagues as a little thing and the very strength and speed of whose motion give it at a distance the appearance of smoothness pope speaks of his long resounding march and energy divine perhaps ease divine had been words more characteristic of that almost superhuman power of language by which he makes the most obstinate materials pliant melts down difficulties as if by the touch of magic and to resume the former figure comes into the goal without a hair turned on his mane or a single sweat drop confessing effort or extraordinary exertion we know no poet since homer who can be compared to dryden in this respect except scott who occasionally in marmion and the lay of the last minstrel exhibits the same impetuous ease and fiery fluent movement scott does not however in general carry the same weight as the other and the species of verse he uses in comparison to the heroic rhyme of dryden gives you often the impression of a hard trot rather than of a long resounding and magnificent gallop scott exhibits in his poetry the soul of a warrior but it is of a warrior of the border somewhat savage and coarse dryden can for the nonce at least assume the appearance and display the spirit of a knight of ancient chivalry gallant accomplished elegant and gay next to this poet s astonishing ease spirit and elastic vigour may be ranked his clear sharp intellect he may be called more a logician than a poet he reasons often and always acutely and his rhyme instead of shackling strengthens the movement of his argumentation parts of his religio laici and the hind and panther resemble portions of duns scotus or aquinas set on fire indeed keen strong intellect inflamed with passion and inspirited by that ardour and impetuosity of mind which wordsworth is compelled to allow to him rather than creative or original genius is the differentia of dryden we have compared him to a courser but he was not one of those coursers of achilles who fed on no earthly food but on the golden barley of heaven having sprung from the gods greek xanthon kai balion to ama pnoiaesi petesthaen tous eteke zephuro anemo arpua podargae dryden resembled rather the mortal steed which was yoked with these immortal twain the brood of zephyr and the harpy podarga only we can hardly say of the poet what homer says of pedasus greek os kai thnaetos eon epeth ippois athanatoisi he was not although a mortal able to keep up with the immortal coursers his path was on the plains or table lands of earth never or seldom in cloudland gorgeous land or through the aerial altitudes which stretch away and above the clouds to the gates of heaven he can hardly be said to have possessed the power of sublimity in the high sense of that term as the power of sympathising with the feeling of the infinite often he gives us the impression of the picturesque of the beautiful of the heroic of the nobly disdainful but never when writing at least entirely from his own mind of that infinite and nameless grandeur which the imaginative soul feels shed on it from the multitudinous waves of ocean from the cataract leaping from his rock as if to consummate an act of prayer to god from the hum of great assemblies of men from the sight of far extended wastes and wildernesses and from the awful silence and the still more mysterious sparkle of the midnight stars this sense of the presence of the shadow of immensity immensity itself cannot be felt any more than measured this sight like that vouchsafed to moses of the backparts of the divine the divine itself cannot be seen has been the inspiration of all the highest poetry of the world of the paradise lost of the divina commedia of the night thoughts of wordsworth and coleridge of festus and highest far of the hebrew prophets as they cry whither can we go from thy presence whither can we flee from thy spirit such poets have resembled a blind man who feels although he cannot see that a stranger of commanding air is in the room beside him so they stand awe struck in the wind of the going of a majestic and unseen being this feeling differs from mysticism inasmuch as it is connected with a reality while the mystic dreams a vague and unsupported dream and the poetry it produces is simply the irresistible cry springing from the perception of this wondrous some one who is actually near them the feeling is connected in general with a lofty moral and religious nature and yet not

makes some mention of this and on sweet agnes night please you with the promis d sight some of husbands some of lovers which an empty dream discovers now what can be more infinitely profane than to use the prayer our lord instituted in such a way there is another prescription which is as follows you must lie in another county and knit the left garter about the right legged stocking let the other garter and stocking alone and as you rehearse these following verses at every comma knit a knot this knot i knit to know the thing i know not yet that i may see the man that shall my husband be how he goes and what he wears and what he does all days and years accordingly in your dream you will see him if a musician with a lute or other instrument if a scholar with a book c now i appeal to you ladies what a ridiculous prescription is this but yet as slight a thing as it is it may be of great importance if it be brought about because then it must be construed to be done by preternatural means and then those words are nothing less than an application to the devil mr aubrey of the royal society says a gentlewoman that he knew confessed in his hearing that she used this method and dreamt of her husband whom she had never seen about two or three years after as she was one sunday at church up pops a young oxonian in the pulpit she cries out presently to her sister this is the

they were young maids and they had dreams of those that married them but a great many of the wittiest part of your sex laugh at these common superstitions but then they are apt to run into worse they give themselves up to the reading of the cabalistical systems of sylphs and gnomes and mandrakes which are very wicked and delusive imaginations i would not have you imagine ladies that i impute these things as infirmities and frailties peculiar to your sex no men and great men too and scholars and even statesmen and princes themselves have been tainted with superstitions and where they infect the minds of such great personages they make the deeper impression according to the stronger and more manly ideas they have of them their greater degree of strength in the intellect only subjects them to greater weaknesses such was even the great paracelsus the wonder and miracle of learning in the age wherein he lived and such were all his followers scholars statesmen divines and princes that are talismanists these talismans that paracelsus pretends to owe to the excogitation and invention of honest art seem to me to be of a very diabolical nature and to owe their rise to being dedicated by the author to the heathen gods thus the cabalists pretending to a vast penetration into arts and sciences though all their thoughts are chimeras and extravagancies unless they be helped by preternatural means say they have found out the several methods appropriated to the several planets they have appropriated gold to the sun on the sunday silver to the moon on the monday iron to mars on the tuesday quicksilver to mercury on the wednesday tin to jupiter on the thursday copper or brass to venus on the friday and lead to saturn on the saturday the methods they take in forming these talismans are too long to dwell upon here but the properties which they pretend belong to them are that the first talisman or seal of the sun will make a man beloved by all princes and potentates and cause him to abound with all the riches his heart can wish the second preserves travellers from danger and is favourable to merchants tradesmen and workmen the third carries destruction to any place

to lay before us such prospects of national advantages and such views of prosperity as would be sufficient to prevail with those who have their eyes upon the good of their country and of their posterity after them that then a case so popular and of so much consequence as this is may not want such due supports as the nature of the thing will allow and especially since the advantages and good consequences of the thing itself are so many and so easy to be seen as his friends allege why should not the good people of britain be made easy and their fears be turned into peaceable satisfaction by seeing that this devil may not be so black as he is painted and that the noise made of the pretender and the frightful things said of his coming and of his being received here may not be made greater scarecrows to us than they really are and after all that has been said if it should appear that the advantages of the pretender s succession are really greater to us and the dangers less to us than those of the succession of hanover then much of their difficulties would be over who standing neuter as to persons appear against the pretender only because they are made to believe strange and terrible things of what shall befall the nation in case of his coming in such as popery slavery french power destroying of our credit and devouring our funds as that scandalous scribbler the review has been labouring to suggest with many other things which we shall endeavour to expose to you as they deserve if we say it should appear then that the dangers and disadvantages of the pretender s succession are less than those of the house of hanover who because of an act of parliament you know must not be called pretenders then there will remain nothing more to be said on that score but the debate must be of the reasonableness and justice on either side for their admittance and there we question not but the side we are really pleading for will have the advantage to begin then with that most popular and affrighting argument now made use of as the bugbear of the people against several other things besides jacobitism we mean french greatness it is most evident that the fear of this must by the nature of the thing be effectually removed upon our receiving the pretender the grounds and reasons why french greatness is rendered formidable to us and so much weight supposed to be in it that like the name of scanderberg we fright our very children with it lie only in this that we suggest the king of france being a professed enemy to the peace and the liberty of great britain will most certainly as soon as he can a little recover himself exercise all that formidable power to put the pretender upon us and not only to place him upon the throne of great britain but to maintain and hold him up in it against all the opposition either of the people of britain or the confederate princes leagued with the elector of hanover who are in the interest of his claim or of his party now it is evident that upon a peaceable admitting this person whom they call the pretender to receive and enjoy the crown here all that formidable power becomes your friend and the being so must necessarily take off from it everything that is called terrible forasmuch as the greater terror and amusement the power we apprehend really carries with it the greater is the tranquillity and satisfaction which accrues to us when we have the friendship of that power which was so formidable to us before the power of france is represented at this time very terrible and the writers who speak of it apply it warm to our imaginations as that from whence we ought justly to apprehend the impossibility of keeping out the pretender and this notwithstanding they allow themselves at the same time to suppose all the confederate powers of europe to be engaged as well by their own interest as by the new treaties of barrier and guarantee to support and to assist the claim of the elector of hanover and his party now if this power be so great and so formidable as they allege will it not on the other side add a proportion of increase to our satisfaction that this power will be wholly in friendship and league with us and engaged to concern itself for the quieting our fears of other foreign invaders forasmuch as having once concerned itself to set the person of the pretender upon the throne it cannot be supposed but it shall be equally concerned to support and maintain him in that possession as what will mightily conduce to the carrying on the other projects of his greatness and glory with the rest of europe in which it will be very much his interest to secure himself from any opposition he might meet with from this nation or from such as might be rendered powerful by our assistance an eminent instance we have of this in the mighty efforts the french nation have made for planting and preserving when planted a grandson of france upon the throne of spain and how eminent are the advantages to france from the success of that undertaking of what less consequence then would it be to the august monarchy of france to secure and engage to himself the constant friendship and assistance of the power of great britain which he would necessarily do by the placing this person upon the throne who would thereby in gratitude be engaged to contribute his utmost in return to the king of france for the carrying on his glorious designs in the rest of europe while then we become thus necessary to the king of france reason dictates that he would be our fast friend our constant confederate our ally firmly engaged to secure our sovereign and protect our people from the insults and attempts of all the world being thus engaged reciprocally with the king of france there must necessarily be an end of all the fears and jealousies,1

and according to luttrell s brief historical relation i in many places was not very pleasing but afforded matter of sport to some persons among several replies was one entitled a letter from a person of quality to his friend clearly there was need to answer this pamphlet and to state more fully the case against the whigs this task was undertaken by two of the greatest writers of english prose george savile then earl later marquis of halifax and john dryden halifax in the tract lately identified as his by hugh macdonald cambridge observations upon a late libel though he might scarify an individual opponent like shaftesbury or pour ridicule upon a sentence from a letter set himself the task of answering the whig case as a whole the text he dilated upon was there seemeth to be no other rule allowed by one sort of men than that they cannot err and the king cannot be in the right with superb irony and wit he demonstrated how inconsistent such an attitude was with the constitution of that day dryden s tract his majesties declaration defended is like the one he is answering in the form of a letter to a friend who has asked the writer s opinion of the declaration and the answer to it i shall obey you the more willingly dryden responds because i know you are a lover of the peace and quietness of your country which the author of this seditious pamphlet is endeavouring to disturb he writes to show the goodness and equity of the prince because once they are understood the faction will lose its power and the well meaning but misled crowd will be no longer deceived by the specious names of religion and liberty after these introductory paragraphs dryden began to reply to the pamphlet point by point his method is to quote or more strictly partly to quote and partly to paraphrase a sentence and then refute its argument in so doing he is following the method of the author of a letter accordingly to understand and judge the fairness of dryden s refutation it is well first to read his majesties declaration then a letter and finally dryden the first has not been reprinted in full but a substantial extract may be found in echard s history of england iii and in arthur bryant s the letters of charles ii pp the second is available in a not uncommon folio state tracts being a collection of several treatises privately printed in the reign of k charles ii and the third is here reproduced for the first time after the perusal of these three tracts the student may well turn to absalom and achitophel and find instruction in comparing the prose and the verse he may reach the conclusion that while both were written to win converts to the royal cause the first was designed to weaken the whig party and the second to take advantage of a tide that had turned to ruin the whig leaders for a fuller discussion of the relationship of dryden s tract and his poem see the writer s article the conclusion of dryden s absalom and achitophel in the huntington library quarterly x in addition to its historical interest dryden s tract is a fine specimen of his masculine vigorous style so well suited to controversial writing i desire to thank mr james m osborn yale

touching the reasons which moved him to dissolve the two last parliaments at westminster and oxford london printed for t davies the kings declaration defended sir since you are pleas d to require my opinion of the kings declaration and the answer to it which you write me word was sent you lately i shall obey you the more willingly because i know you are a lover of the peace and quietness of your country which the author of this seditious pamphlet is endeavouring to disturb be pleas d to understand then that before the declaration was yet published and while it was only the common news that such an one there was intended to justifie the dissolution of the two last parliaments it was generally agreed by the heads of the discontented party that this declaration must be answer d and that with all the ingredients of malice which the ablest amongst them could squeeze into it accordingly upon the first appearance of it in print five several pens of their cabal were set to work and the product of each having been examin d a certain person of quality appears to have carried the majority of votes and to be chosen like a new matthias to succeed in the place of their deceas d judas he seems to be a man cut out to carry on vigorously the designs of the phanatique party which are manifestly in this paper to hinder the king from making any good impression on his subjects by giving them all possible satisfaction and the reason of this undertaking is manifest for if once the goodness and equity of the prince comes to be truly understood by the people the authority of the faction is extinguish d and the well meaning crowd who are misled will no longer gape after the specious names of religion and liberty much like the folly of the jews expecting a messiah still to come whose

means and then those words are nothing less than an application to the devil mr aubrey of the royal society says a gentlewoman that he knew confessed in his hearing that she used this method and

give themselves up to the reading of the cabalistical systems of sylphs and gnomes and mandrakes which are very wicked and delusive imaginations i would not have you imagine ladies that i impute these things as infirmities and frailties peculiar to your sex no men and great men too and scholars and even statesmen and princes themselves have been tainted with superstitions and where they infect the minds of such great personages they make the deeper impression according to the stronger and more manly ideas they have of them their greater degree of strength in the intellect only subjects them to greater weaknesses such was even the great paracelsus the wonder and miracle of learning in the age wherein he lived and such were all his followers scholars statesmen divines and princes that are talismanists these talismans that paracelsus pretends to owe to the excogitation and invention of honest art seem to me to be of a very diabolical nature and to owe their rise to being dedicated by the author to the heathen gods thus the cabalists pretending to a vast penetration into arts and sciences though all their thoughts are chimeras and extravagancies unless they be helped by preternatural means say they have found out the several methods appropriated to the several planets they have appropriated gold to the sun on the sunday silver to the moon on the monday iron to mars on the tuesday quicksilver to mercury on the wednesday tin to jupiter on the thursday copper or brass to venus on the friday and lead to saturn on the saturday the methods they take in forming these

where was a den and laid me down in that place to sleep and as i slept i dreamed a dream i dreamed and behold i saw a man clothed with rags standing in a certain place with his face from his own house a book in his hand and a great burden upon his back i looked and saw him open the book and read therein and as he read he wept and trembled and not being able longer to contain he brake out with a lamentable cry saying what shall i do bedford jail in which bunyan was twelve years a prisoner in this plight therefore he went home and restrained himself as long as he could that his wife and children should not perceive his distress but he could not be silent long because that his trouble increased wherefore at length he brake his mind to his wife and children and thus he began to talk to them oh my dear wife said he and you my sweet children i your dear friend am in myself undone by reason of a burden that lieth hard upon me moreover i am told to a certainty that this our city will be burned with fire from heaven in which fearful overthrow both myself with thee my wife and you my sweet babes shall miserably come to ruin except some way of escape can be found whereby we may be delivered at this all his family were sore amazed not for that they believed that what he had said to them was true but because they thought that some frenzy or madness had got into his head therefore it drawing towards night and they hoping that sleep might settle his brain with all haste they got him to bed but the night was as troublesome to him as the day wherefore instead of sleeping he spent it in sighs and tears so when the morning was come they would know how he did he told them worse and worse he also set to talking to them again but they began to be hardened they also thought to drive away his madness by harsh and surly treatment of him sometimes they would ridicule sometimes they would chide and sometimes they would quite neglect him wherefore he began to retire himself to his chamber to pray for and pity them and also to sorrow over his own misery he would also walk solitary in the fields sometimes reading and sometimes praying and thus for some days he spent his time sidenote christian s distress of mind now i saw upon a time when he was walking in the fields that he was as he was wont reading in his book and greatly distressed in his mind and as he read he burst out as he had done before crying what shall i do to be saved i saw also that he looked this way and that way as if he would run yet he stood still because as i perceived he could not tell which way to go i looked then and saw a man named evangelist coming to him who asked wherefore dost thou cry illustration evangelist points to wicket gate page he answered sir i read in the book in my hand that i am condemned to die and after that to come to judgment and i find that i am not willing to do the first nor able to do the second then said evangelist why not willing to die since this life is troubled with so many evils the man answered because i fear that this burden that is upon my back will sink me lower than the grave and i shall fall into tophet and sir if i be not fit to go to prison i am not fit to go to judgment and from thence to death and the thoughts of these things make me cry tophet here means hell then said evangelist if this be thy condition why standest thou still he answered because i know not whither to go then he gave him a parchment roll and there was written within flee from the wrath to come the man therefore read it and looking upon evangelist very carefully said whither must i fly then said evangelist pointing with his finger over a very wide field do you see yonder wicket gate the man said no then said the other do you see yonder shining light he said i think i do then said evangelist keep that light in your eye and go up directly thereto so shalt thou see the gate at which when thou knockest it shall be told thee what thou shalt do so i saw in my dream that the man began to run now he had not run far from his own door when his wife and children perceiving it began to cry after him to return but the man put his fingers in his ears and ran on crying life life eternal life so he looked not behind him but fled towards the middle of the plain sidenote christian flees from the city the neighbors also came out to see him run and as he ran some mocked others threatened and some cried after him to return and among those that did so there were two that resolved to fetch him back by force the name of the one was obstinate and the name

old friendship again and beg your pardon for my breach of it and if you can forgive me you are the best of women o says mrs bargrave do not mention such a thing i have not had an uneasy thought about it i can easily forgive it what did you think of me said mrs veal says mrs bargrave i thought you were like the rest of the world and that prosperity had made you forget yourself and me then mrs veal reminded mrs bargrave of the many friendly offices she did her in former days and much of the conversation they had with each other in the times of their adversity what books they read and what comfort in particular they received from drelincourt s book of death which was the best she said on that subject ever written she also mentioned dr sherlock the two dutch books which were translated written upon death and several others but drelincourt she said had the clearest notions of death and of the future state of any who had handled that subject then she asked mrs bargrave whether she had drelincourt she said yes says mrs veal fetch it and so mrs bargrave goes up stairs and brings it down says mrs veal dear mrs bargrave if the eyes of our faith were as open as the eyes of our body we should see numbers of angels about us for our guard the notions we have of heaven now are nothing like what it is as drelincourt says therefore be comforted under your afflictions and believe that the almighty has a particular regard to you and that your afflictions are marks of god s favour and when they have done the business they are sent for they shall be removed from you and believe me my dear friend believe what i say to you one minute of future happiness will infinitely reward you for all your sufferings for i can never believe and claps her hand upon her knee with great earnestness which indeed ran through most of her discourse that ever god will suffer you to spend all your days in this afflicted state but be assured that your afflictions shall leave you or you them in a short time she spake in that pathetical and heavenly manner that mrs bargrave wept several times she was so deeply affected with it then mrs veal mentioned dr kenrick s ascetick at the end of which he gives an account of the lives of the primitive christians their pattern she recommended to our imitation and said their conversation was not like this of our age for now says she there is nothing but frothy vain discourse which is far different from theirs theirs was to edification and to build one another up in faith so that they were not as we are nor are we as they were but says she we ought to do as they did there was an hearty friendship among them but where is it now to be found says mrs bargrave it is hard indeed to find a true friend in these days says mrs veal mr norris has a fine copy of verses called friendship in perfection which i wonderfully admire have you seen the book says mrs veal no says mrs bargrave but i have the verses of my own writing out have you says mrs veal then fetch them which she did from above stairs and offered them to mrs veal to read who refused and waived the thing saying holding down her head would make it ache and then desired mrs bargrave to read them to her which she did as they were admiring friendship mrs veal said dear mrs bargrave i shall love you for ever in these verses there is twice used the word elysian ah says mrs veal these poets have such names for heaven she would often draw her hand across her own eyes and say mrs bargrave do not you think i am mightily impaired by my fits no says mrs bargrave i think you look as well as ever i knew you after all this discourse which the apparition put in much finer words than mrs bargrave said she could pretend to and as much more than she can remember for it cannot be thought that an hour and three quarters conversation could all be retained though the main of it she thinks she does she said to mrs bargrave she would have her write a letter to her brother and tell him she would have him give rings to such and such and that there was a purse of gold in her cabinet and that she would have two broad pieces given to her cousin watson talking at this rate mrs bargrave thought that a fit was coming upon her and so placed herself in a chair just before her knees to keep her from falling to the ground if her fits should occasion it for the elbow chair she thought would keep her from falling on either side and to divert mrs veal as she thought took hold of her gown sleeve several times and commended it mrs veal told her it was a scowered silk and newly made up but for all this mrs veal persisted in her request and told mrs bargrave she must not deny her and she would have her tell her brother all their conversation when she had opportunity dear mrs veal says mrs bargrave this seems so impertinent that i cannot tell how to comply with it and what a mortifying story will our conversation be to a young gentleman why says mrs bargrave it is much better methinks to do it yourself no says mrs veal though it seems impertinent to you now you will see more reason for it hereafter mrs bargrave then to satisfy her importunity was going to fetch a pen and ink but

i am not fit to go to judgment and from thence to death and the thoughts of these things make me cry tophet here means hell then said evangelist if this be thy condition why standest thou still he answered because i know not whither to go then he gave him a parchment roll and there was written within flee from the wrath to come the man therefore read it and looking upon evangelist very carefully said whither must i fly then said evangelist pointing with his finger over a very wide field do you see yonder wicket gate the man said no then said the other do you see yonder shining light he said i think i do then said evangelist keep that light in your eye and go up directly thereto so shalt thou see the gate at which when thou knockest it shall be told thee what thou shalt do so i saw in my dream that the man began to run now he had not run far from his own door when his wife and children perceiving it began to cry after him to return but the man put his fingers in his ears and ran on crying life life eternal life so he looked not behind him but fled towards the middle of the plain sidenote christian flees from the city the neighbors also came out to see him run and as he ran some mocked others threatened and some cried after him to return and among those that did so there were two that resolved to fetch him back by force the name of the one was obstinate and the name of the other pliable now by this time the man was got a good distance from them but however they were resolved to pursue him which they did and in a little time they overtook him then said the man neighbors wherefore are ye come they said to persuade you to go back with us but he said that can by no means be you dwell said he in the city of destruction the place also where i was born i see it to be so and dying there sooner or later you will sink lower than the grave into a place that burns with fire and brimstone be content good neighbors and go along with me obst what said obstinate and leave our friends and comforts behind us chris yes said christian for that was his name because that all which you forsake is not worthy to be compared with a little of that i am seeking to enjoy and

words be for the pretender and this can be no otherwise understood than to have a design however remote and upon whatever views to bring him in to possess the throne of these kingdoms the matter then being laid down thus as sincerely and plainly as possible we come to the question point blank and think it our duty to say with the greatest sincerity that we do not believe the ministry are in any kind or with any prospect near or remote acting for or with a design or view to bring in the pretender having granted this we must however to prevent any breaking in by way of cavil on one hand or triumph on the other subjoin immediately that we do not in the least grant by this that the protestant succession is in no danger even from several of the measures now taken in the world it is far from any reflection upon the ministry to say that however they may act upon a right sincere principle for the protestant succession in all they do which as above we profess to believe yet that many of the tools they make use of are of another make and have no edge to cut any other way no thoughts to move them towards any other end no other centre which they can have any tendency to that the pretender s interest is the magnet which draws them by its secret influence to point to him as their pole that they have their aim at his establishment here and own it to be their aim and as they are not shy to profess it among themselves so their conduct in many things makes it sufficiently public this is not meant as any reflection upon the ministry for making use of such men the late ministry did the same and every ministry will and must employ men sometimes not as they always join with them in their politic principles but as either the men are found useful in their several employments or as the ministry may be under other circumstances which makes it necessary to them to employ them nor as the review well enough observed does it follow that because the ministry have employed or joined with jacobites in the public affairs that therefore they must have done it with a jacobite principle but let the ministry employ these men by what necessity or upon what occasion they will though it may not follow that the ministry are therefore for the pretender yet it does not also follow that there is no danger of the protestant succession from the employing those sort of people for what if the queen should die the ministry it is hoped are established in the interest of their queen and country and therefore it has been argued that supposing the ministry had the pretender in their eye yet that it is irrational to suggest that they can have any such view during the life of her present majesty nay even those professed jacobites who we spoke of just now cannot be so ungrateful to think of deposing the queen who has been so bountiful so kind so exceeding good to them as in several cases to suffer them to be brought into the management of her own affairs when by their character they might have been thought dangerous even to her person thus winning and engaging them by her bounty and the confidence that has been placed in them not to attempt anything to her prejudice without the most monstrous ingratitude without flying in the face of all that sense of honour and obligation which it is possible for men of common sense to entertain and it can hardly be thought that even papists themselves under the highest possessions of their religious zeal can conquer the native aversions they must have to such abominable ingratitude or to think of bringing in the pretender upon this protestant nation even while the queen shall be on the throne but though this may and some doubt that also tie up their hands during the queen s life yet they themselves give us but small reason to expect anything from them afterward and it will be hard to find anybody to vouch for them then these very jacobites papists and professed enemies to the revolution may be supposed upon these pretensions to be quiet and offer no violence to the present establishment while her majesty has the possession and while that life lasts to which they are so much indebted for her royal goodness and clemency but what would they do if the queen should die come we next to the french king we are told that not the french king only but even the whole french nation are wonderfully forward to acknowledge the obligation they are under to the justice and favour which they have received from her majesty in the putting an end to the war a war which lay heavy upon them and threatened the very name of the french nation with ruin and much more threatened the glory of the french court and of their great monarch with an entire overthrow a total eclipse a war which by their own confession it was impossible for them long to have supported the expenses of and which by the great superiority of the allies became dreadful to them and that every campaign more than the other a war which they were in such pain to see the end of that they tried all the powers and courts in christendom who were the least neutral to engage a mediation in order to a treaty and all in vain and a war which if her majesty had not inclined to put an end to must have ended perhaps to the disadvantage and confusion of both france and spain if not of all christendom the obligations the french are under for the bringing this war to so just and honourable a conclusion are not at all concealed nay the french themselves have not been backward to make them public the declarations made by the french king of his sincerity in the overtures made for a general peace the protestations of his being resolved to enter into an entire confidence and a league offensive and defensive with the queen s majesty for the

long night of forgetfulness it was in this scene of strife and bloodshed that the incidents we shall attempt to relate occurred during the third year of the war which england and france last waged for the possession of a country that neither was destined to retain the imbecility of her military leaders abroad and the fatal want of energy in her councils at home had lowered the character of great britain from the proud elevation on which it had been placed by the talents and enterprise of her former warriors and statesmen no longer dreaded by her enemies her servants were fast losing the confidence of self respect in this mortifying abasement the colonists though innocent of her imbecility and too humble to be the agents of her blunders were but the natural participators they had recently seen a chosen army from that country which reverencing as a mother they had blindly believed invincible an army led by a chief who had been selected from a crowd of trained warriors for his rare military endowments disgracefully routed by a handful of french and indians and only saved from annihilation by the coolness and spirit of a virginian boy whose riper fame has since diffused itself with the steady influence of moral truth to the uttermost confines of christendom a wide frontier had been laid naked by this unexpected disaster and more substantial evils were preceded by a thousand fanciful and imaginary dangers the alarmed colonists believed that the yells of the savages mingled with every fitful gust of wind that issued from the interminable forests of the west the terrific character of their merciless enemies increased immeasurably the natural horrors of warfare numberless recent massacres were still vivid in their recollections nor was there any ear in the provinces so deaf as not to have drunk in with avidity the narrative of some fearful tale of midnight murder in which the natives of the forests were the principal and barbarous actors as the credulous and excited traveller related the hazardous chances of the wilderness the blood of the timid curdled with terror and mothers cast anxious glances even at those children which slumbered within the security of the largest towns in short the magnifying influence of fear began to set at naught the calculations of reason and to render those who should have remembered their manhood the slaves of the basest of passions even the most confident and the stoutest hearts began to think the issue of the contest was becoming doubtful and that abject class was hourly increasing in numbers who thought they foresaw all the possessions of the english crown in america subdued by their christian foes or laid waste by the inroads of their relentless allies when therefore intelligence was received at the fort which covered the southern termination of the portage between the hudson and the lakes that montcalm had been seen moving up the champlain with an army numerous as the leaves on the trees its truth was admitted with more of the craven reluctance of fear than with the stern joy that a warrior should feel in finding an enemy within reach of his blow the news had been brought towards the decline of a day in midsummer by an indian runner who also bore an urgent request from munro the commander of a work on the shore of the holy lake for a speedy and powerful reinforcement it has already been mentioned that the distance between these two posts was less than five leagues the rude path which originally formed their line of communication had been widened for the passage of wagons so that the distance which had been travelled by the son of the forest in two hours might easily be effected by a detachment of troops with their necessary baggage between the rising and setting of a summer sun the loyal servants of the british crown had given to one of these forest fastnesses the name of william henry and to the other that of fort edward calling each after a favorite prince of the reigning family the veteran scotchman just named held the first with a regiment of regulars and a few provincials a force really by far too small to make head against the formidable power that montcalm was leading to the foot of his earthen mounds at the latter however lay general webb who commanded the armies of the king in the northern provinces with a body of more than five thousand men by uniting the several detachments of his command this officer might have arrayed nearly double that number of combatants against the enterprising frenchman who had ventured so far from his reinforcements with an army but little superior in numbers but under the influence of their degraded fortunes both officers and men appeared better disposed to await the approach of their formidable antagonists within their works than to resist the progress of their march by emulating the successful example of the french at fort du quesne and striking a blow on their advance after the first surprise of the intelligence had a little abated a rumor was spread through the entrenched camp which stretched along the margin of the hudson forming a chain of outworks to the body of the fort itself that a chosen detachment of fifteen hundred men was to depart with the dawn for william henry the post at the northern extremity of the portage that which at first was only rumor soon became certainty as orders passed from the quarters of the commander in chief to the several corps he had selected for this service to prepare for their speedy departure all doubt as to the intention of webb

and verse condemned to eat nothing but their own cotton and quench their thirst with their own ink these and a thousand other reformations i firmly counted upon by your encouragement as indeed they were plainly deducible from the precepts delivered in my book and it must be owned that seven months were a sufficient time to correct every vice and folly to which yahoos are subject if their natures had been capable of the least disposition to virtue or wisdom yet so far have you been from answering my expectation in any of your letters that on the contrary you are loading our carrier every week

others make me author of books to which i am wholly a stranger i find likewise that your printer has been so careless as to confound the times and mistake the dates of my several voyages and returns

they please i hear some of our sea yahoos find fault with my sea language as not proper in many parts nor now in use i cannot help it in my first voyages while i was young i was instructed by the oldest mariners and learned to speak as they did but i have since found that the sea yahoos are apt like the land ones to become new fangled in their words which the latter change every year insomuch as i remember upon each return to my own country their old dialect was so altered that i could hardly understand the new and i observe when any yahoo comes from london out of curiosity to visit me at my house we neither of us are able to deliver our conceptions in a manner intelligible to the other if the censure of the yahoos could any way affect me i should have great reason to complain that some of them are so bold as to think my book of travels a mere fiction out of mine own brain and have gone so far as to drop hints that the houyhnhnms and yahoos have no more existence than the inhabitants of utopia indeed i must confess that as to the people of lilliput brobdingrag for so the word should have been spelt and not erroneously brobdingnag and laputa i have never yet heard of any yahoo so presumptuous as to dispute their being or the facts i have related concerning them because the truth immediately strikes every reader with conviction and is there less probability in my account of the houyhnhnms or yahoos when it is manifest as to the latter there are so many thousands even in this country who only differ from their brother brutes in houyhnhnmland because they use a sort of jabber and do not go naked i wrote for their amendment and not their approbation the united praise of the whole race would be of less consequence to me than the neighing of those two degenerate houyhnhnms i keep in my stable because from these degenerate as they are i still improve in some virtues without any mixture of vice do these miserable animals presume to think that i am so

words be for the pretender and this can be no otherwise understood than to have a design however remote and upon whatever views to bring him in to possess the throne of these kingdoms the matter then being laid down thus as sincerely and plainly as possible we come to the question point blank and think it our duty to say with the greatest sincerity that we do not believe the ministry are in any kind or with any prospect near or remote acting for or with a design or view to bring in the pretender having granted this we must however to prevent any breaking in by way of cavil on one hand or triumph on the other subjoin immediately that we do not in the least grant by this that the protestant succession is in no danger even from several of the measures now taken in the world it is far from any reflection upon the ministry to say that however they may act upon a right sincere principle for the protestant succession in all they do which as above we profess to believe yet that many of the tools they make use of are of another make and have no edge to cut any other way no thoughts to move them towards any other end no other centre which they can have any tendency to that the pretender s interest is the magnet which draws them by its secret influence to point to him as their pole that they have their aim at his establishment here and own it to be their aim and as they are not shy to profess it among themselves so their conduct in many things makes it sufficiently public this is not meant as any reflection upon the ministry for making use of such men the late ministry did the same and every ministry will and must employ men sometimes not as they always join with them in their politic principles but as either the men are found useful in their several employments or as the ministry may be under other circumstances which makes it necessary to them to employ them nor as the review well enough observed does it follow that because the ministry have employed or joined with jacobites in the public affairs that therefore they must have done it with a jacobite principle but let the ministry employ these men by what necessity or upon what occasion they will though it may not follow that the ministry are therefore for the pretender yet it does not also follow that there is no danger of the protestant succession from the employing those sort of people for what if the queen should die the ministry it is hoped are established in the interest of their queen and country and therefore it has been argued that supposing the ministry had the pretender in their eye yet that it is irrational to suggest that they can have any such view during the life of her present majesty nay even those professed jacobites who we spoke of just now cannot be so ungrateful to think of deposing the queen who has been so bountiful so kind so exceeding good to them as in several cases to suffer them to be brought into the management of her own affairs when by their character they might have been thought dangerous even to her person thus winning and engaging them by her bounty and the confidence that has been placed in them not to attempt anything to her prejudice without the most monstrous ingratitude without flying in the face of all that sense of honour and obligation which it is possible for men of common sense to entertain and it can hardly be thought that even papists themselves under the highest possessions of their religious zeal can conquer the native aversions they must have to such abominable ingratitude or to think of bringing in the pretender upon this protestant nation even while the queen shall be on the throne but though this may and some doubt that also tie up their hands during the queen s life yet they themselves give us but small reason to expect anything from them afterward and it will be hard to find anybody to vouch for them then these very jacobites papists and professed enemies to the revolution may be supposed upon these pretensions to be quiet and offer no violence to the present establishment while her majesty has the possession and while that life lasts to which they are so much indebted for her royal goodness and clemency but what would they do if the queen should die come we next to the french king we are told that not the french king only but even the whole french nation are wonderfully forward to acknowledge the obligation they are under to the justice and favour which they have received from her majesty in the putting an end to the war a war which lay heavy upon them and threatened the very name of the french nation with ruin and much more threatened the glory of the french court and of their great monarch with an entire overthrow a total eclipse a war which by their own confession it was impossible for them long to have supported the expenses of and which by the great superiority of the allies became dreadful to them and that every campaign more than the other a war which they were in such pain to see the end of that they tried all the powers and courts in christendom who were the least neutral to engage a mediation in order to a treaty and all in vain and a war which if her majesty had not inclined to put an end to must have ended perhaps to the disadvantage and confusion of both france and spain if not of all christendom the obligations the french are under for the bringing this war to so just and honourable a conclusion are not at all concealed nay the french themselves have not been backward to make them public the declarations made by the french king of his sincerity in the overtures made for a general peace the protestations of his being resolved to enter into an entire confidence and a league offensive and defensive with the queen s majesty for the

ira something to distract the minds of the populace from the consequences of its own deeds and the helplessness of its legislators procureur chaumette enlarged upon his original idea like a true artist who sees the broad effect of a picture at a glance and then fills in the minute details he was already busy elaborating his scheme the goddess must be beautiful not too young reason can only go hand in hand with the riper age of second youth she must be decked out in classical draperies severe yet suggestive she must be rouged and painted for she is a mere idol easily to be appeased with incense music and laughter he was getting deeply interested in his subject seeking minutiae of detail with which to render his theme more and more attractive but patience was never the characteristic of the revolutionary government of france the national assembly soon tired of chaumette s dithyrambic utterances up aloft on the mountain danton was yawning like a gigantic leopard soon henriot was on his feet he had a far finer scheme than that of the procureur to place before his colleagues a grand national fete semi religious in character but of the new religion which destroyed and desecrated and never knelt in worship citizen chaumette s goddess of reason by all means henriot conceded that the idea was a good one but the goddess merely as a figure head around her a procession of unfrocked and apostate priests typifying the destruction of ancient hierarchy mules carrying loads of sacred vessels the spoils of ten thousand churches of france and ballet girls in bacchanalian robes dancing the carmagnole around the new deity public prosecutor foucquier tinville thought all these schemes very tame why should the people of france be led to think that the era of a new religion would mean an era of milk and water of pageants and of fireworks let every man woman and child know that this was an era of blood and again of blood oh he exclaimed in passionate accents would that all the traitors in france had but one head that it might be cut off with one blow of the guillotine he approved of the national fete but he desired an apotheosis of the guillotine he undertook to find ten thousand traitors to be beheaded on one grand and glorious day ten thousand heads to adorn the place de la revolution on a great never to be forgotten evening after the guillotine had accomplished this record work but collot d herbois would also have his say collot lately hailed from the south with a reputation for ferocity unparalleled throughout the whole of this horrible decade he would not be outdone by tinville s bloodthirsty schemes he was the inventor of the noyades which had been so successful at lyons and marseilles why not give the inhabitants of paris one of these exhilarating spectacles he asked with a coarse brutal laugh then he explained his invention of which he was inordinately proud some two or three hundred traitors men women and children tied securely together with ropes in great human bundles and thrown upon a barge in the middle of the river the barge with a hole in her bottom not too large only sufficient to cause her to sink slowly very slowly in sight of the crowd of delighted spectators the cries of the women and children and even of the men as they felt the waters rising and gradually enveloping them as they felt themselves powerless even for a fruitless struggle had proved most exhilarating so citizen collot declared to the hearts of the true patriots of lyons thus the discussion continued this was the era when every man had but one desire that of outdoing others in ferocity and brutality and but one care that of saving his own head by threatening that of his neighbour the great duel between the titanic leaders of these turbulent parties the conflict between hot headed danton on the one side and cold blooded robespierre on the other had only just begun the great all devouring monsters had dug their claws into one another but the issue of the combat was still at stake neither of these two giants had taken part in these deliberations anent the new religion and the new goddess danton gave signs now and then of the greatest impatience and muttered something about a new form of tyranny a new kind of oppression on the left robespierre in immaculate sea green coat and carefully gauffered linen was quietly polishing the nails of his right hand against the palm of his left but nothing escaped him of what was going on his ferocious egoism his unbounded ambition was even now calculating what advantages to himself might accrue from this idea of the new religion and of the national fete what personal aggrandisement he could derive therefrom the matter outwardly seemed trivial enough but already his keen and calculating mind had seen various side issues which might tend to place him robespierre on a yet higher and more unassailable pinnacle surrounded by those who hated him those who envied and those who feared him he ruled over them all by the strength of his own cold blooded savagery by the resistless power of his merciless cruelty he cared about nobody but himself about nothing but his own exaltation every action of his career since he gave up his small practice in a quiet provincial town in order to throw himself into the wild vortex of revolutionary politics every word he ever uttered had but one aim himself he saw his colleagues and comrades of the old jacobin clubs ruthlessly destroyed around him friends he had none and all left him indifferent and now he had hundreds of enemies

south seas a trade carried on with the greatest advantage and to the greatest degree that any particular commerce has been carried on in the world for many ages past insomuch that we found the return of silver that came back to france by those ships was not only the enriching of the merchants of st malo rochelle and other ports in france some of whom we saw get immense estates in a few years even to a million sterling a man but it was evident the king of france himself was enabled by the circulation of so much bullion through his mints to carry on that war with very great advantage it was just at the close of this war when some merchants of london looking with envy on the success of that trade and how the french notwithstanding the peace would apparently carry it on for some years at least to infinite advantage began to consider whether it might not be possible to come in for a portion of it with france as they were allied to spain and yet go abroad in the nature of a private cruiser to bring this to pass it was thought proper in the first place to get a share if possible in a new design of an east india trade in flanders just then intended to be set up by some british merchants by the assistance of an imperial charter or at least under colour of it and so we might go to sea in a threefold capacity to be made use of as occasion might present viz when on the coast of new spain we sought to trade we were frenchmen had a french captain and a sufficient number of french seamen and flemish or walloon seamen who spoke french so to appear on all proper occasions when at sea we met with any spanish ship worth our while we were english cruisers had letters of mart from england had no account of the peace and were fitted for the attack and when in the east indies we had occasion to trade either at the english or dutch settlements we should have imperial colours and two flemish merchants at least in appearance to transact everything as we found occasion however this last part of our project failed us that affair not being fully ripe as this mysterious equipment may be liable to some exceptions and perhaps to some inquiries i shall for the present conceal my name and that of the ship also by inquiries i mean inquiries of private persons concerned for as to public inquiries we have no uneasiness having acted nothing in contradiction to the rules and laws of our country but i say as to private persons it is thought fit to prevent their inquiries to which end the captain in whose name i write this gives me leave to make use of his name and conceal my own the ship sailed from the river the th of december and went directly over to the coast of flanders lying at an anchor in newport pitts as they are called where we took in our french captain jean michael merlotte who with thirty two french seamen came on board us in a large snow from dunkirk bringing with them one hundred and twenty two small ankers or rundlets of brandy and some hampers and casks of french wine in wickered bottles while we were here we lay under english colours with pendants flying our ship being upwards of five hundred ton and had forty six guns mounted manned with three hundred and fifty six men we took the more men on board because we resolved as occasion should present to fit ourselves with another ship which we did not question we should meet with in the south seas we had also a third design in our voyage though it may be esteemed an accident to the rest viz we were resolved to make some attempts for new discoveries as opportunity offered and we had two persons on board who were exceeding well qualified for our direction in this part all which was derived from the following occasion the person who was principally concerned in the adventure was a man not only of great wealth but of great importance he was particularly addicted to what we call new discoveries and it was indeed upon his genius to such things that the first thought of the voyage was founded this gentleman told me that he had already sent one ship fully equipped and furnished for a new attempt upon the north west or north east passages which had been so often in vain tried by former navigators and that he did not question the success because he had directed them by new measures and to steer a course that was never attempted yet and his design in our voyage was to make like discoveries towards the south pole where as he said and gave us very good reasons for it he did not doubt but we might discover even to the pole itself and find out new worlds and new seas which had never been heard of before with these designs this gentleman came into the other part of our project and contributed the more largely and with the more freedom to the whole upon that account in particular all the needful preparations for such discoveries were made wholly at his expense which i take notice of here as being most proper in the beginning of our story and that the reader may the less wonder at the particular way we took to perform a voyage which might with much more ease have been done by the usual and ordinary way we sailed from the coast of flanders the nd of january and without any extraordinary incident made the coast of galway in ireland the th where we stayed and took in a very extraordinary store of provisions three times as much as usual the beef being also well pickled or double packed that we might have a sufficient reserve for the length of our voyage resolving also to spare it as much as possible we had a very rich cargo on board consisting of all sorts of british manufactures suitable for the spanish trade in their west indies and as we aimed at nothing of trade till we came to the spanish coast we sailed directly,1

name of the french nation with ruin and much more threatened the glory of the french court and of their great monarch with an entire overthrow a total eclipse a war which by their own confession it was impossible for them long to have supported the expenses of and which by the great superiority of the allies became dreadful to them and that every campaign more than the other a war which they were in such pain to see the end of that they tried all the powers and courts in christendom who were the least neutral to engage a mediation in order to a treaty and all in vain and a war which if her majesty had not inclined to put an end to must have ended perhaps to the disadvantage and confusion of both france and spain if not of all christendom the obligations the french are under for the bringing this war to so just and honourable a conclusion are not at all concealed nay the french themselves have not been backward to make them public the declarations made by the french king of his

should be obliged to blame the favourites of the people he will be considered as the tool of power if he censures those in power he will be looked on as an instrument of faction but in all exertions of duty something is to be hazarded in cases of tumult and disorder our law has invested every man in some sort with the authority of a magistrate when the affairs of the nation are distracted private people are by the spirit of that law justified in stepping a little out of their ordinary sphere they enjoy a privilege of somewhat more dignity and effect than that of idle lamentation over the calamities of their country they may look into them narrowly they may reason upon them liberally and if they should be so fortunate as to discover the true source of the mischief and to suggest any probable method of removing it though they may displease the rulers for the day they are certainly of service to the cause of government government is deeply interested in everything which even through the medium of some temporary uneasiness may tend finally to compose the minds of the subjects and to conciliate their affections i have nothing to do here with the abstract value of the voice of the people but as long as reputation the most precious possession of every individual and as long as opinion the great support of the state depend entirely upon that voice it can never be considered as a thing of little consequence either to individuals or to government nations are not primarily ruled by laws less by violence whatever original energy may be supposed either in force or regulation the operation of both is in truth merely instrumental nations are governed by the same methods and on the same principles by which an individual without authority is often able to govern those who are his equals or his superiors by a knowledge of their temper and by a judicious management of it i mean when public affairs are steadily and quietly conducted not when government is nothing but a continued scuffle between the magistrate and the multitude in which sometimes the one and sometimes the other is uppermost in which they alternately yield and prevail in a series of contemptible victories and scandalous submissions the temper of the people amongst whom he presides ought therefore to be the first study of a statesman and the knowledge of this temper it is by no means impossible for him to attain if he has not an interest in being ignorant of what it is his duty to learn to complain of the age we live in to murmur at the present possessors of power to lament the past to conceive extravagant hopes of the future are the common dispositions of the greater part of mankind indeed the necessary effects of the ignorance and levity of the vulgar such complaints and humours have existed in all times yet as all times have not been alike true political sagacity manifests itself in distinguishing that complaint which only characterises the general infirmity of human nature from those which are symptoms of the particular distemperature of our own air and season nobody i believe will consider it merely as the language of spleen or disappointment if i say that there is something particularly alarming in the present conjuncture there is hardly a man in or out of power who holds any other language that government is at once dreaded and contemned that the laws are despoiled of all their respected and salutary terrors that their inaction is a subject of ridicule and their exertion of abhorrence that rank and office and title and all the solemn plausibilities of the world have lost their reverence and effect that our foreign politics are as much deranged as our domestic economy that our dependencies are slackened in their affection and loosened from their obedience that we know neither how to yield nor how to enforce that hardly anything above or below abroad or at home is sound and entire but that disconnection and confusion in offices in parties in families in parliament in the nation prevail beyond the disorders of any former time these are facts universally admitted and lamented this state of things is the more extraordinary because the great parties which formerly divided and agitated the kingdom are known to be in a manner entirely dissolved no great external calamity has visited the nation no pestilence or famine we do not labour at present under any scheme of taxation new or oppressive in the quantity or in the mode nor are we engaged in unsuccessful war in which our misfortunes might easily pervert our judgment and our minds sore from the loss of national glory might feel every blow of fortune as a crime in government it is impossible that the cause of this strange distemper should not sometimes become a subject of discourse it is a compliment due and which i willingly pay to those who administer our affairs to take notice in the first place of their speculation our ministers are of opinion that the increase of our trade and manufactures that our growth by colonisation and by conquest have concurred to accumulate immense wealth in the hands of some individuals and this again being dispersed amongst the people has rendered them universally proud ferocious and ungovernable that the insolence of some from their enormous wealth and the boldness of others from a guilty poverty have rendered them capable of the most atrocious attempts so that they have trampled upon all subordination and violently borne down the unarmed laws of a free government barriers too feeble against the fury of a populace so fierce and licentious as ours they contend that no adequate provocation has been given for so spreading a discontent our affairs having been conducted throughout with remarkable temper and consummate wisdom,1

engage in religious controversy and the furious contest civil and ecclesiastical which ensued on the accession of queen anne gave him an opportunity of gratifying his favourite passion he therefore published a tract entitled the shortest way with the dissenters or proposals for the establishment of the church which contained an ironical recommendation of persecution but written in so serious a strain that many persons particularly dissenters at first mistook its real intention the high church party however saw and felt the ridicule and by their influence a prosecution was commenced against him and a proclamation published in the gazette offering a reward for his apprehension when de foe found with how much rigour himself and his pamphlet were about to be treated he at first secreted himself but his printer and bookseller being taken into custody he surrendered being resolved as he expresses it to throw himself upon the favour of government rather than that others should be ruined for his mistakes in july he was brought to trial found guilty and sentenced to be imprisoned to stand in the pillory and to pay a fine of two hundred marks he underwent the infamous part of the

fine and the expense of his discharge gratitude and fidelity are inseparable from an honest man and it was this benevolent act that prompted de foe to support harley with his able and ingenious pen when anne lay lifeless and his benefactor in the vicissitude of party was persecuted by faction and overpowered though not conquered by violence the talents and perseverance of de foe began now to be properly estimated and as a firm supporter of the administration he was sent by lord godolphin to scotland on an errand which as he says was far from being unfit for a sovereign to direct or an honest man to perform his knowledge of commerce and revenue his powers of insinuation and above all his readiness of pen were deemed of no small utility in promoting the union of the two kingdoms of which he wrote an able history in with two dedications one to the queen and another to the duke of queensbury soon afterwards he unhappily by some equivocal writings rendered himself suspected by both parties so that he once more retired to newington in hopes of spending the remainder of his days in peace his pension being withdrawn and wearied with politics he began to compose works of a different kind

propagate their falsehoods in de foe published the family instructor a work inculcating the domestic duties in a lively manner by narration and dialogue and displaying much knowledge of life in the

the king to consent to a bill for triennial parliaments when swift took up his residence at moor park he found there a little girl of eight daughter of a merchant named edward johnson who had died young swift says that esther johnson was born on march in the parish register of richmond which shows that she was baptized on march her name is given as hester but she signed her will esther the name by which she was always known swift says her father was a younger brother of a good family in nottinghamshire her mother of a lower degree and indeed she had little to boast in her birth mrs johnson had two children esther and ann and lived at moor park as companion to lady giffard temple s widowed sister another member of the household afterwards to be esther s constant companion was rebecca dingley a relative of the temple family she was a year or two older than swift the lonely young man of twenty two was both playfellow and teacher of the delicate child of eight how he taught her to write has been charmingly brought before us in the painting exhibited by miss dicksee at the royal academy a few years ago he advised her what books to read and instructed her as he says in the principles of honour and virtue from which she never swerved in any one action or moment of her life by swift had grown tired of his position and finding that temple who valued his services was slow in finding him preferment he left moor park in order to carry out his resolve to go into the church he was ordained and obtained the prebend of kilroot near belfast where he carried on a flirtation with a miss waring whom he called varina but in may temple made proposals which induced swift to return to moor park where he was employed in preparing temple s memoirs and correspondence for publication and in supporting the side taken by temple in the letters of phalaris controversy by writing the battle of the books which was however not published until on his return to temple s house swift found his old playmate grown from a sickly child into a girl of fifteen in perfect health she came he says to be looked upon as one of the most beautiful graceful and agreeable young women in london only a little too fat her hair was blacker than a raven and every feature of her face in perfection on his death in january temple left a will dated directing the payment of pounds each with half a year s wages to bridget johnson and all my other servants and leaving a lease of some land in monistown county wicklow to esther johnson servant to my sister giffard by a codicil of february temple left pounds to mr jonathan swift now living with me it may be added that by her will of proved in the following year lady giffard gave pounds to mrs moss mrs bridget johnson who had married richard mose or moss lady giffard s steward the will proceeds to mrs hester sic johnson i give pounds with the pounds i put into the exchequer for her life and my own and declare the pounds to be hers which i am told is there in my name upon the survivorship and for which she has constantly sent over her certificate and received the interest i give her besides my two little silver candlesticks temple left in swift s hands the task of publishing his posthumous works a duty which afterwards led to a quarrel with lady giffard and other members of the family many years later swift told lord palmerston that he stopped at moor park solely for the benefit of temple s conversation and advice and the opportunity of pursuing his studies at temple s death he was as far to seek as ever in the summer of however he was offered and accepted the post of secretary and chaplain to the earl of berkeley one of the lords justices but when he reached ireland he found that the secretaryship had been given to another he soon however obtained the living of laracor agher and rathbeggan and the prebend of dunlavin in st patrick s cathedral dublin the total value of these preferments was about pounds a year an income which miss waring seems to have thought enough to justify him in marrying swift s reply to the lady whom he had singled out at first from the rest of women could only have been written with the intention of breaking off the connection and accordingly we hear no more of poor varina at laracor a mile or two from trim and twenty miles from dublin swift ministered to a congregation of about fifteen persons and had abundant leisure for cultivating his garden making a canal after the dutch fashion of moor park planting willows and rebuilding the vicarage as chaplain to lord berkeley he spent much of his time in dublin he was on intimate terms with lady berkeley and her daughters one of whom is best known by her married name of lady betty germaine and through them he had access to the fashionable society of dublin when lord berkeley returned to england in april swift after taking his doctor s degree at dublin went with him and soon afterwards published anonymously a political pamphlet a discourse on the contests and dissentions in athens and rome when he returned to ireland in september he was accompanied by stella to give esther johnson the name by which she is best known and her friend mrs dingley stella s fortune was about pounds and the property temple had left her was in county wicklow swift very much for his own satisfaction who had few friends or acquaintance in ireland persuaded stella now twenty years old that living was cheaper there than in england and that a better return was obtainable on money the ladies took his advice and

him he was a thorn in the side of mr purfleet the usher who was generally in charge of the playground who had learned by long experience that whenever bob repton was quiet he was certain to be planning some special piece of mischief the usher was sitting now on a bench with a book in his hand but his attention was at present directed to a group of four boys who had drawn together in a corner of the playground there is repton again he said to himself i wonder what he is plotting now that boy will be the death of me i am quite sure it was he who put that eel in my bed last week though of course i could not prove it mr purfleet prided himself on his nerve he had been telling the boys some stories he had read of snakes in india among them one of an officer who when seated at table had felt a snake winding itself round his leg and who sat for several minutes without moving until some friends brought a saucer of milk and placed it near when the snake uncurled itself and went to drink it must have required a lot of nerve mr purfleet bob repton had said to sit as quiet as that not at all not at all the usher replied confidently it was the natural thing to do a man should always be calm in case of sudden danger bob the first thought in his mind should be what is this the second what had best be done under the circumstances and these two things being decided a man of courage will deal coolly with the danger i should despise myself if i were to act otherwise it was two nights later that the usher having walked down between the two rows of beds in the dormitory and seeing that all the boys were quiet and apparently asleep proceeded to his own bed which was at the end of the room and partly screened off from the rest by a curtain no sooner did he disappear behind this than half a dozen heads were raised an oil lamp burned at the end of the room affording light for the usher to undress and enabling him as he lay in bed to command a general if somewhat faint view of the dormitory five minutes after mr purfleet had disappeared behind the curtain the watching eyes saw the clothes at the end of the bed pulled down and caught a partial view of mr purfleet as he climbed in a second later there was a yell of terror and the usher leapt from the bed instantly the dormitory was in an uproar what is it mr purfleet what is the matter sir and several of the boys sprang from their beds and ran towards him the only exceptions to the general excitement being the four or five who were in the secret these lay shaking with suppressed laughter with the bedclothes or the corner of a pillow thrust into their mouths to prevent them from breaking out into screams of delight what is it sir it was some time before the usher could recover himself sufficiently to explain there is a snake in my bed he said a snake the boys repeated in astonishment several of the more timid at once making off to their beds certainly a snake mr purfleet panted i put my legs down and they came against something cold and it began to twist about in a moment if i had not leapt out i should no doubt have received a fatal wound where did it come from what is to be done and a variety of other questions burst from the boys i will run down and get three or four hockey sticks mr purfleet one of the elder boys said that will be the best plan mason quick quick there do you see it moving under the clothes there was certainly something wriggling so there was a general movement back from the bed we had better hold the clothes down mr purfleet bob repton said pushing himself forward if it were to crawl out at the top and get on to the floor it might bite a dozen of us i will hold the clothes down tight on one side if someone will hold them on the other one of the other boys came forward and the clothes were stretched tightly across the bed by the pillow in a minute or two mason ran up with four hockey sticks now you must be careful mr purfleet said because if it should get out the consequences might be terrible now then four of you take the sticks and all hit together as hard as you can now the sticks descended together there was a violent writhing and contortion beneath the clothes but the blows rained down fast and in a very short time all movement ceased it must be dead now bob repton said i think we can look at it now sir well draw the clothes down very gently boys and be ready to strike again if you see the least movement the clothes were drawn down till the creature was visible it must be a cobra the usher said looking at it from a distance it is thick and short it must have escaped from somewhere be very careful all of you mason approached cautiously to get a nearer view and then exclaimed why sir it is an eel there was a moment s silence and then a perfect yell of laughter from the boys for a moment the usher was dumbfounded then he rallied you will all go to your beds at once he said i shall report the matter to mr tulloch in the morning the boys retired laughing to their beds but above the din the usher heard the words in a muffled voice a man should always be calm in sudden danger another voice equally disguised said yes he should first ask himself what is this then what had best be done under the circumstances a third voice then took it up it follows that a man of courage will deal coolly with the

south seas a trade carried on with the greatest advantage and to the greatest degree that any particular commerce has been carried on in the world for many ages past insomuch that we found the return of silver that came back to france by those ships was not only the enriching of the merchants of st malo rochelle and other ports in france some of whom we saw get immense estates in a few years even to a million sterling a man but it was evident the king of france himself was enabled by the circulation of so much bullion through his mints to carry on that war with very great advantage it was just at the close of this war when some merchants of london looking with envy on the success of that trade and how the french notwithstanding the peace would apparently carry it on for some years at least to infinite advantage began to consider whether it might not be possible to come in for a portion of it with france as they were allied to spain and yet go abroad in the nature of a private cruiser to bring this to pass it was thought proper in the first place to get a share if possible in a new design of an east india trade in flanders just then intended to be set up by some british merchants by the assistance of an imperial charter or at least under colour of it and so we might go to sea in a threefold capacity to be made use of as occasion might present viz when on the coast of new spain we sought to trade we were frenchmen had a french captain and a sufficient number of french seamen and flemish or walloon seamen who spoke french so to appear on all proper occasions when at sea we met with any spanish ship worth our while we were english cruisers had letters of mart from england had no account of the peace and were fitted for the attack and when in the east indies we had occasion to trade either at the english or dutch settlements we should have imperial colours and two flemish merchants at least in appearance to transact everything as we found occasion however this last part of our project failed us that affair not being fully ripe as this mysterious equipment may be liable to some exceptions and perhaps to some inquiries i shall for the present conceal my name and that of the ship also by inquiries i mean inquiries of private persons concerned for as to public inquiries we have no uneasiness having acted nothing in contradiction to the rules and laws of our country but i say as to private persons it is thought fit to prevent their inquiries to which end the captain in whose name i write this gives me leave to make use of his name and conceal my own the ship sailed from the river the th of december and went directly over to the coast of flanders lying at an anchor in newport pitts as they are called where we took in our french captain jean michael merlotte who with thirty two french seamen came on board us in a large snow from dunkirk bringing with them one hundred and twenty two small ankers or rundlets of brandy and some hampers and casks of french wine in wickered bottles while we were here we lay under english colours with pendants flying our ship being upwards of five hundred ton and had forty six guns mounted manned with three hundred and fifty six men we took the more men on board because we resolved as occasion should present to fit ourselves with another ship which we did not question we should meet with in the south seas we had also a third design in our voyage though it may be esteemed an accident to the rest viz we were resolved to make some attempts for new discoveries as opportunity offered and we had two persons on board who were exceeding well qualified for our direction in this part all which was derived from the following occasion the person who was principally concerned in the adventure was a man not only of great wealth but of great importance he was particularly addicted to what we call new discoveries and it was indeed upon his genius to such things that the first thought of the voyage was founded this gentleman told me that he had already sent one ship fully equipped and furnished for a new attempt upon the north west or north east passages which had been so often in vain tried by former navigators and that he did not question the success because he had directed them by new measures and to steer a course that was never attempted yet and his design in our voyage was to make like discoveries towards the south pole where as he said and gave us very good reasons for it he did not doubt but we might discover even to the pole itself and find out new worlds and new seas which had never been heard of before with these designs this gentleman came into the other part of our project and contributed the more largely and with the more freedom to the whole upon that account in particular all the needful preparations for such discoveries were made wholly at his expense which i take notice of here as being most proper in the beginning of our story and that the reader may the less wonder at

engage in religious controversy and the furious contest civil and ecclesiastical which ensued on the accession of queen anne gave him an opportunity of gratifying his favourite passion he therefore published a tract entitled the shortest way with the dissenters or proposals for the establishment of the church which contained an ironical recommendation of persecution but written in so serious a strain that many persons particularly dissenters at first mistook its real intention the high church party however saw and felt the ridicule and by their influence a prosecution was commenced against him and a proclamation published in the gazette offering a reward for his apprehension when de foe found with how much rigour himself and his pamphlet were about to be treated he at first secreted himself but his printer and bookseller being taken into custody he surrendered being resolved as he expresses it to throw himself upon the favour of government rather than that others should be ruined for his mistakes in july he was brought to trial found guilty and sentenced to be imprisoned to stand in the pillory and to pay a fine of two hundred marks he underwent the infamous part of the punishment with great fortitude and it seems to have been generally thought that he was treated with unreasonable severity so far was he from being ashamed of his fate himself that he wrote a hymn to the pillory which thus ends alluding to his accusers tell them the men that plac d him here are scandals to the times are at a loss to find his guilt and can t commit his crimes pope who has thought

instances of injustice and malignity which so frequently occur in the dunciad and which reflect more dishonour on the author than on the parties traduced de foe lay friendless and distressed in newgate his family ruined and himself without hopes of deliverance till sir robert harley who approved of his principles and foresaw that during a factious age such a genius could be converted to many uses represented his unmerited sufferings to the queen and at length procured his release the treasurer lord godolphin also sent a considerable sum to his wife and family and to him money to pay his fine and the expense of his discharge gratitude and fidelity are inseparable from an honest man and it was this benevolent act that prompted de foe to support harley with his able and ingenious pen when anne lay lifeless and his benefactor in the vicissitude of party was persecuted by faction and overpowered though not conquered by violence the talents and perseverance of de foe began now to be properly estimated and as a firm supporter of the administration he was sent by lord godolphin to scotland on an errand which as he says was far from being unfit for a sovereign to direct or an honest man to perform his knowledge of commerce and revenue his powers of insinuation and above all his readiness of pen were deemed of no small utility in promoting the union of the two kingdoms of which he wrote an able history in with two dedications one to the queen and another to the duke of queensbury soon afterwards he unhappily by some equivocal writings rendered himself suspected by both parties so that he once more retired to newington in hopes of spending the remainder of his days in peace his pension being withdrawn and wearied with politics he began to compose works of a different kind the year may therefore be regarded as the period of de foe s political life faction henceforth found other advocates and parties procured other writers to disseminate their suggestions and to propagate their falsehoods in de foe published the family instructor a work inculcating the domestic duties in a lively manner by narration and dialogue and displaying much knowledge of life in the middle ranks of society religious courtship also appeared soon after which like the family instructor is eminently religious and moral in its tendency and strongly impresses on the mind that spirit of

the king to consent to a bill for triennial parliaments when swift took up his residence at moor park he found there a little girl of eight daughter of a merchant named edward johnson who had died young swift says that esther johnson was born on march in the parish register of richmond which shows that she was baptized on march her name is given as hester but she signed her will esther the name by which she was always known swift says her father was a younger brother of a good family in nottinghamshire her mother of a lower degree and indeed she had little to boast in her birth mrs johnson had two children esther and ann and lived at moor park as companion to lady giffard temple s widowed sister another member of the household afterwards to be esther s constant companion was rebecca dingley a relative of the temple family she was a year or two older than swift the lonely young man of twenty two was both playfellow and teacher of the delicate child of eight how he taught her to write has been charmingly brought before us in the painting exhibited by miss dicksee at the royal academy a few years ago he advised her what books to read and instructed her as he says in the principles of honour and virtue from which she never swerved in any one action or moment of her life by swift had grown tired of his position and finding that temple who valued his services was slow in finding him preferment he left moor park in order to carry out his resolve to go into the church he was ordained and obtained the prebend of kilroot near belfast where he carried on a flirtation with a miss waring whom he called varina but in may temple made proposals which induced swift to return to moor park where he was employed in preparing temple s memoirs and correspondence for publication and in supporting the side taken by temple in the letters of phalaris controversy by writing the battle of the books which was however not published until on his return to temple s house swift found his old playmate grown from a sickly child into a girl of fifteen in perfect health she came he says to be looked upon as one of the most beautiful graceful and agreeable young women in london only a little too fat her hair was blacker than a raven and every feature of her face in perfection on his death in january temple left a will dated directing the payment of pounds each with half a year s wages to bridget johnson and all my other servants and leaving a lease of some land in monistown county wicklow to esther johnson servant to my sister giffard by a codicil of february temple left pounds to mr jonathan swift now living with me it may be added that by her will of proved in the following year lady giffard gave pounds to mrs moss mrs bridget johnson who had married richard mose or moss lady giffard s steward the will proceeds to mrs hester sic johnson i give pounds with the pounds i put into the exchequer for her life and my own and declare the pounds to be hers which i am told is there in my name upon the survivorship and for which she has constantly sent over her certificate and received the interest i give her besides my two little silver candlesticks temple left in swift s hands the task of publishing his posthumous works a duty which afterwards led to a quarrel with lady giffard and other members of the family many years later swift told lord palmerston that he stopped at moor park solely for the benefit of temple s conversation and advice and the opportunity of pursuing his studies at temple s death he was as far to seek as ever in the summer of however he was offered and accepted the post of secretary and chaplain to the earl of berkeley one of the lords justices but when he reached ireland he found that the secretaryship had been given to another he soon however obtained the living of laracor agher and rathbeggan and the prebend of dunlavin in st patrick s cathedral dublin the total value of these preferments was about pounds a year an income which miss waring seems to have thought enough to justify him in marrying swift s reply to the lady whom he had singled out at first from the rest of women could only have been written with the intention of breaking off the connection and accordingly we hear no more of poor varina at laracor a mile or two from trim and twenty miles from dublin swift ministered to a congregation of about fifteen persons and had abundant leisure for cultivating his garden making a canal after the dutch fashion of moor park planting willows and rebuilding the vicarage as chaplain to lord berkeley he spent much of his time in dublin he was on intimate terms with lady berkeley and her daughters one of whom is best known by her married name of lady betty germaine and through them he had access to the fashionable society of dublin when lord berkeley returned to england in april swift after taking his doctor s degree at dublin went with him and soon afterwards published anonymously a political pamphlet a discourse on the contests and dissentions in athens and rome when he returned to ireland in september he was accompanied by stella to give esther johnson the name by which she is best known and her friend mrs dingley stella s fortune was about pounds and the property temple had left her was in county wicklow swift very much for his own satisfaction who had few friends or acquaintance in ireland persuaded stella now twenty years old that living was cheaper there than in england and that a better return was obtainable on money the ladies took his advice and made ireland their home at first they felt themselves strangers in dublin the adventure looked so like a frolic,1

coats and the procedure in duels good natured foppish and idle he felt quite happy and in his element thus to be made chief organiser of the tragic farce about to be enacted on the parquet floor of the gaming saloon he looked about the room for a while scrutinising the faces of those around him the gilded youth was crowding round de marny a few older men stood in a group at the farther end of the room to these the marquis turned and addressing one of them an elderly man with a military bearing and a shabby brown coat mon colonel he said with another flourishing bow i am deputed by m d roul de to provide him with seconds for this affair of honour may i call upon you to certainly certainly replied the colonel i am not intimately acquainted with m d roul de but since you stand sponsor m le

prefer not to indeed i am entirely at m d roul de s service said the colonel who had thrown a quick scrutinising glance at the isolated figure near the card table if he will accept my services he will be very glad to accept my dear colonel whispered the marquis with an ironical twist of his aristocratic lips he has no friends in our set and if you and de quettare will honour him i think he should be grateful m de quettare adjutant to m le colonel was ready to follow in the footsteps of his chief and the two men after the prescribed salutations to m le marquis de villefranche went across to speak to d roul de if you will accept our services monsieur began the colonel abruptly mine and my adjutant s m de quettare we place ourselves entirely at your disposal i thank you messieurs rejoined d roul de the whole thing is a farce and that young man is a fool but i have been in the wrong and you would wish to apologise queried the colonel icily the worthy soldier had heard something of d

proceeding an apology bah disgusting cowardly beneath the dignity of any gentleman however wrong he might be how could two soldiers of his majesty s army identify themselves with such doings but d

extraordinary display of bourgeois cowardice you mean monsieur le colonel queried d roul de that you must either fight the vicomte de marny to night or clear out of paris to morrow your position in our set would become untenable retorted the colonel not unkindly for in spite of d roul de s extraordinary attitude there was nothing in his bearing or his appearance that suggested cowardice or fear

weeks although it was at a time of the year when usually the bills are very moderate the usual number of burials within the bills of mortality for a week was from about or thereabouts to the last was esteemed a pretty high bill but after this we found the bills successively increasing as follows buried increased december the th to the th th rd january january the rd th th th th th this last bill was really frightful being a higher number than had been known to have been buried in one week since the preceding visitation of however all this went off again and the weather proving cold and the frost which began in december still continuing very severe even till near the end of february attended with sharp though moderate winds the bills decreased again and the city grew healthy and everybody began to look upon the danger as good as over only that still the burials in st giles s continued high from the beginning of april especially they stood at twenty five each week till the week from the th to the th when there was buried in st giles s parish thirty whereof two of the plague and eight of the spotted fever which was looked upon as the same thing likewise the number that died of the spotted fever in the whole increased being eight the week before and twelve the week above named this alarmed us all again and terrible apprehensions were among the people especially the weather being now changed and growing warm and the summer being at hand however the next week there seemed to be some hopes again the bills were low the number of the dead in all was but there was none of the plague and but four of the spotted fever but the following week it returned again and the distemper was spread into two or three other parishes viz st andrew s holborn st clement danes and to the great affliction of the city one died within the walls in the parish of st mary woolchurch that is to say in bearbinder lane near stocks market in all there were nine of the plague and six of the spotted fever it was however upon inquiry found that this frenchman who died in bearbinder lane was one who having lived in long acre near the infected houses had removed for fear of the distemper not knowing that he was already infected this was the beginning of may yet the weather was temperate variable and cool enough and people had still some hopes that which encouraged them was that the city was healthy the whole ninety seven parishes buried but fifty four and we began to hope that as it was chiefly among the people at that end of the town it might go no farther and the rather because the next week which was from the th of may to the th there died but three of which not one within the whole city or liberties and st andrew s buried but fifteen which was very low tis true st giles s buried two and thirty but still as there was but one of the plague people began to be easy the whole bill also was very low for the week before the bill was but and the week above mentioned but we continued in these hopes for a few days but it was but for a few for the people were no more to be deceived thus they searched the houses and found that the plague was really spread every way and that many died of it every day so that now all our extenuations abated and it was no more to be concealed nay it quickly appeared that the infection had spread itself beyond all hopes of abatement that in the parish of st giles it was gotten into several streets and several families lay all sick together and accordingly in the weekly bill for the next week the thing began to show itself there was indeed but fourteen set down of the plague but this was all knavery and collusion for in st giles s parish they buried forty in all whereof it was certain most of them died of the plague though they were set down of other distempers and though the number of all the burials were not increased above thirty two and the whole bill being but yet there was fourteen of the spotted fever as well as fourteen of the plague and we took it for granted upon the whole that there were fifty died that week of the plague the next bill was from the rd of may to the th when the number of the plague was seventeen but the burials in st giles s were fifty three a frightful number of whom they set down but nine of the plague but on an examination more strictly by the justices of peace and at the lord mayor s request it was found there were twenty more who were really dead of the plague in that parish but had been set down of the spotted fever or other distempers besides others concealed but those were trifling things to what followed immediately after for now the weather set in hot and from the first week in june the infection spread in a dreadful manner and the bills rose high the articles of the fever spotted fever and teeth began to swell for all that could conceal their distempers did it to prevent their neighbours shunning and refusing to converse with them and also to prevent authority shutting up their houses which though it was not yet practised yet was threatened and people were extremely terrified at the thoughts of it the second week in june the parish of st giles

the contrary that say they cannot preach nor pray but as the spirit of god moveth them blessed be god that hath made us sensible of our own weakness emptiness and poverty our help hath been in the name of the lord who made heaven and earth who hath given his son to be an helper and an all sufficient saviour to us with him he hath given sufficient power and strength whereby we are enabled to overcome the devil the enemy of our souls so that we may be enabled to stand against principalities and powers against spiritual wickedness and conquer all the powers of darkness and fight the good fight of faith and finish our course with joy and keep the faith seeing there is laid up for us a crown of righteousness which the lord the righteous judge shall give us at that day and not only to us saith the apostle but unto all them that love his appearing we have not an high priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities but was in all points tempted like as we are yet without sin christ our redeemer was tempted that he might succour those that are tempted when the devil tempted our saviour in the wilderness and could not prevail he went away and left him the prince of this world found nothing in him upon which he could fasten his temptation christ will enable those that believe in him to overcome the devil and to be more than conquerors through him that loved them he came into the world to purge and purify his people and to be the author of eternal salvation to all them that believe in him and obey him but it is said he did not many mighty works among some to whom he preached the everlasting gospel because of their unbelief many will not believe in the inward and spiritual appearance of jesus christ the son of god who is the light of the world they will

rank an act of mutiny but the soldiers of cromwell had so high a notion of their own importance and privileges that they resented this summary justice upon their companion a court martial sat upon my

fleshy nose and a full lipped mouth which tightened and set when he was angry his grey eyes were piercing and soldier like yet i have seen them lighten up into a kindly and merry twinkle his voice was the most tremendous and awe inspiring that i have ever listened to i can well believe what i have heard that when he chanted the hundredth psalm as he rode down among the blue bonnets at dunbar the sound of him rose above the blare of trumpets and the crash of guns like the deep roll of a breaking wave yet though he possessed every quality which was needed to raise him to distinction as an officer he had thrown off his military habits when he returned to civil life as he prospered and grew rich he might well have worn a sword but instead he would ever bear a small copy of the scriptures bound to his girdle where other men hung their weapons he was sober and measured in his speech and it was seldom even in the bosom of his own family that he would speak of the scenes which he had taken part in or of the great men fleetwood and harrison blake and ireton desborough and lambert some of whom had been simple troopers like himself when the troubles broke out he was frugal in his eating backward in drinking and allowed himself no pleasures save three pipes a day of oronooko tobacco which he kept ever in a brown jar by the great wooden chair on the left hand side of the mantelshelf yet for all his self restraint the old leaven would at times begin to work in him and bring on fits of what his enemies would call fanaticism and his friends piety though it must be confessed that this piety was prone to take a fierce and fiery shape as i look back one or two instances of that stand out so hard and clear in my recollection that they might be scenes which i had seen of late in the playhouse instead of memories of my childhood more than threescore years ago when the second charles was on the throne the first of these occurred when i was so young that i can remember neither what went before nor what immediately after it it stuck in my infant mind when other things slipped through it we were all in the house one sultry summer evening when there came a rattle of kettledrums and a clatter of hoofs which brought my mother and my father to the door she with me in her arms that i might have the better view it was a regiment of horse on their way from chichester to portsmouth with colours flying and band playing making the bravest show that ever my youthful eyes had rested upon with what wonder and admiration did i gaze at the sleek prancing steeds the steel morions the plumed hats of the officers the scarfs and bandoliers never i thought had such a gallant company assembled and i clapped my hands and cried out in my delight my father smiled gravely and took me from my mother s arms nay lad he said thou art a soldier s son and should have more judgment than to commend such a rabble as this canst thou not child as thou art see that their

only is the spirit of the institutions in harmony with these leases but so is the letter also men must draw a distinction between the spirit of the institutions and their own spirits the latter being often nothing more than a stomach that is not easily satisfied it would be just as true to affirm that domestic slavery is opposed to the institutions of the united states as to say the same of these leases it would be just as rational to maintain because a does not choose to make an associate of b that he is acting in opposition to the spirit of the institutions inasmuch as the declaration of independence advances the dogmas that men are born equal as it is to say it is opposed to the same spirit for b to pay rent to a according to his covenant it is pretended that the durable leases are feudal in their nature we do not conceive this to be true but admitting it to be so it would only prove that feudality to this extent is a part of the institutions of the state what is more it would become a part over which the state itself has conceded all power of control beyond that which it may remotely possess as one out of twenty eight communities as respects this feudal feature it is not easy to say where it must be looked for it is not to be found in the simple fact of paying rent for that is so general as to render the whole country feudal could it be true it cannot be in the circumstance that the rent is to be paid in kind as it is called and in labour for that is an advantage to the tenant by affording him the option since the penalty of a failure leaves the alternative of paying in money it must be therefore that these leases are feudal because they run for ever now the length of the lease is clearly a concession to the tenant and was so regarded when received and there is not probably a single tenant under lives who would not gladly exchange his term of possession for that of one of these detestable durable leases among the absurdities that have been circulated on this subject of feudality it has been pretended that the well known english statute of quia emptores has prohibited fines for alienation or that the quarter sales fifth sales sixth sales c of our own leases were contrary to the law of the realm when made under the common law in certain cases of feudal tenures the fines for alienation were an incident of the tenure the statute of quia emptores abolished that general principle but it in no manner forbade parties to enter into covenants of the nature of quarter sales did they see fit the common law gives all the real estate to the eldest son our statute divides the real estate among the nearest of kin without regard even to sex it might just as well be pretended that the father cannot devise all his lands to his eldest son under our statute as to say that the law of edward i prevents parties from bargaining for quarter sales altering a provision of the common law does not preclude parties from making covenants similar to its ancient provisions feudal tenures were originally divided into two great classes those which were called the military tenures or knight s service and soccage the first tenure was that which became oppressive in the progress of society soccage was of two kinds free and villian the first has an affinity to our own system as connected with these leases the last never existed among us at all when the knight s service or military tenures of england were converted into free soccage in the reign of charles ii the concession was considered of a character so favourable to liberty as to be classed among the great measures of the time one of which was the habeas corpus act the only feature of our own leases in the least approaching villian soccage is that of the day s works but every one acquainted with the habits of american life will understand that husbandmen in general throughout the northern states would regard it as an advantage to be able to pay their debts in this way and the law gives them an option since a failure to pay in kind or in work merely incurs the forfeiture of paying what the particular thing is worth in money in point of fact money has always been received for these day s works and at a stipulated price but it is pretended whatever may be the equity of these leasehold contracts they are offensive to the tenants and ought to be abrogated for the peace of the state the state is bound to make all classes of men respect its laws and in nothing more so than in the fulfilment of their legal contracts the greater the number of the offenders the higher the obligation to act with decision and efficiency to say that these disorganizers ought not to be put down is to say that crime is to obtain impunity by its own extent and to say that they cannot be put down under our form of government is a direct admission that the government is unequal to the discharge of one of the plainest and commonest obligations of all civilized society if this be really so the sooner we get rid of the present form of government the better the notion of remedying such an evil by concession is as puerile as it is dishonest the larger the concessions become the greater will be the exactions of a cormorant cupidity as soon as quiet is obtained by these means in reference to the leasehold tenures it will be demanded by some fresh combination to attain some other end

words be for the pretender and this can be no otherwise understood than to have a design however remote and upon whatever views to bring him in to possess the throne of these kingdoms the matter then being laid down thus as sincerely and plainly as possible we come to the question point blank and think it our duty to say with the greatest sincerity that we do not believe the ministry are in any kind or with any prospect near or remote acting for or with a design or view to bring in the pretender having granted this we must however to prevent any breaking in by way of cavil on one hand or triumph on the other subjoin immediately that we do not in the least grant by this that the protestant succession is in no danger even from several of the measures now taken in the world it is far from any reflection upon the ministry to say that however they may act upon a right sincere principle for the protestant succession in all they do which as above we profess to believe yet that many of the tools they make use of are of another make and have no edge to cut any other way no thoughts to move them towards any other end no other centre which they can have any tendency to that the pretender s interest is the magnet which draws them by its secret influence to point to him as their pole that they have their aim at his establishment here and own it to be their aim and as they are not shy to profess it among themselves so their conduct in many things makes it sufficiently public this is not meant as any reflection upon the ministry for making use of such men the late ministry did the same and every ministry will and must employ men sometimes not as they always join with them in their politic principles but as either the men are found useful in their several employments or as the ministry may be under other circumstances which makes it necessary to them to employ them nor as the review well enough observed does it follow that because the ministry have employed or joined with jacobites in the public affairs that therefore they must have done it with a jacobite principle but let the ministry employ these men by what necessity or upon what occasion they will though it may not follow that the ministry are therefore for the pretender yet it does not also follow that there is no danger of the protestant succession from the employing those sort of people for what if the queen should die the ministry it is hoped are established in the interest of their queen and country and therefore it has been argued that supposing the ministry had the pretender in their eye yet that it is irrational to suggest that they can have any such view during the life of her present majesty nay even those professed jacobites who we spoke of just now cannot be so ungrateful to think of deposing the queen who has been so bountiful so kind so exceeding good to them as in several cases to suffer them to be brought into the management of her own affairs when by their character they might have been thought dangerous even to her person thus winning and engaging them by her bounty and the confidence that has been placed in them not to attempt anything to her prejudice without the most monstrous ingratitude without flying in the face of all that sense of honour and obligation which it is possible for men of common sense to entertain and it can hardly be thought that even papists themselves under the highest possessions of their religious zeal can conquer the native aversions they must have to such abominable ingratitude or to think of bringing in the pretender upon this protestant nation even while the queen shall be on the throne but though this may and some doubt that also tie up their hands during the queen s life yet they themselves give us but small reason to expect anything from them afterward and it will be hard to find anybody to vouch for them then these very jacobites papists and professed enemies to the revolution may be supposed upon these pretensions to be quiet and offer no violence to the present establishment while her majesty has the possession and while that life lasts to which they are so much indebted for her royal goodness and clemency but what would they do if the queen should die come we next to the french king we are told that not the french king only but even the whole french nation are wonderfully forward to acknowledge the obligation they are under to the justice and favour which they have received from her majesty in the putting an end to the war a war which lay heavy upon them and threatened the very name of the french nation with ruin and much more threatened the glory of the french court and of their great monarch with an entire overthrow a total eclipse a war which by their own confession it was impossible for them long to have supported the expenses of and which by the great superiority of the allies became dreadful to them and that every campaign more than the other a war which they were in such pain to see the end of that they tried all the powers and courts in christendom who were the least neutral to engage a mediation in order to a treaty and all in vain and a war which if her majesty had not inclined to put an end to must have ended perhaps to the disadvantage and confusion of both france and spain if not of all christendom the obligations the french are under for the bringing this war to so just and honourable a conclusion are not at all concealed nay the french themselves have not been backward to make them public the declarations made by the french king of his

because i know you have a fond brother oh says mrs veal i gave my brother the slip and came away because i had so great a desire to see you before i took my journey so mrs bargrave went in with her into another room within the first and mrs veal sat her down in an elbow chair in which mrs bargrave was sitting when she heard mrs veal knock then says mrs veal my dear friend i am come to renew our old friendship again and beg your pardon for my breach of it and if you can forgive me you are the best of women o says mrs bargrave do not mention such a thing i have not had an uneasy thought about it i can easily forgive it what did you think of me said mrs veal says mrs bargrave i thought you were like the rest of the world and that prosperity had made you forget yourself and me then mrs veal reminded mrs bargrave of the many friendly offices she did her in former days and much of the conversation they had with each other in the times of their adversity what books they read and what comfort in particular they received from drelincourt s book of death which was the best she said on that subject ever written she also mentioned dr sherlock the two dutch books which were translated written upon death and several others but drelincourt she said had the clearest notions of death and of the future state of any who had handled that subject then she asked mrs bargrave whether she had drelincourt she said yes says mrs veal fetch it and so mrs bargrave goes up stairs and brings it down says mrs veal dear mrs bargrave if the eyes of our faith were as open as the eyes of our body we should see numbers of angels about us for our guard the notions we have of heaven now are nothing like what it is as drelincourt says therefore be comforted under your afflictions and believe that the almighty has a particular regard to you and that your afflictions are marks of god s favour and when they have done the business they are sent for they shall be removed from you and believe me my dear friend believe what i say to you one minute of future happiness will infinitely reward you for all your sufferings for i can never believe and claps her hand upon her knee with great earnestness which indeed ran through most of her discourse that ever god will suffer you to spend all your days in this afflicted state but be assured that your afflictions shall leave you or you them in a short time she spake in that pathetical and heavenly manner that mrs bargrave wept several times she was so deeply affected with it then mrs veal mentioned dr kenrick s ascetick at the end of which he gives an account of the lives of the primitive christians their pattern she recommended to our imitation and said their conversation was not like this of our age for now says she there is nothing but frothy vain discourse which is far different from theirs theirs was to edification and to build one another up in faith so that they were not as we are nor are we as they were but says she we ought to do as they did there was an hearty friendship among them but where is it now to be found says mrs bargrave it is hard indeed to find a true friend in these days says mrs veal mr norris has a fine copy of verses called friendship in perfection which i wonderfully admire have you seen the book says mrs veal no says mrs bargrave but i have the verses of my own writing out have you says mrs veal then fetch them which she did from above stairs and offered them to mrs veal to read who refused and waived the thing saying holding down her head would make it ache and then desired mrs bargrave to read them to her which she did as they were admiring friendship mrs veal said dear mrs bargrave i shall love you for ever in these verses there is twice used the word elysian ah says mrs veal these poets have such names for heaven she would often draw her hand across her own eyes and say mrs bargrave do not you think i am mightily impaired by my fits no says mrs bargrave i think you look as well as ever i knew you after all this discourse which the apparition put in much finer words than mrs bargrave said she could pretend to and as much more than she can remember for it cannot be thought that an hour and three quarters conversation could all be retained though the main of it she thinks she does she said to mrs bargrave she would have her write a letter to her brother and tell him she would have him give rings to such and such and that there was a purse of gold in her cabinet and that she would have two broad pieces given to her cousin watson talking at this rate mrs bargrave thought that a fit was coming upon her and so placed herself in a chair just before her knees to keep her from falling to the ground if her fits should occasion it for the elbow chair she thought would keep her from falling on either side and to divert mrs veal as she thought took hold of her gown sleeve several times and commended it mrs veal told her it was a scowered silk and newly made up but for all this mrs veal persisted in her request and told mrs bargrave she must not deny her and she would have her tell her brother all their conversation when she had opportunity dear mrs veal says mrs bargrave this seems so impertinent that i cannot tell how to comply with it and what a mortifying story will our conversation be to a young gentleman why says mrs bargrave it is much better methinks to do it yourself no says mrs veal though it seems impertinent to you now you will see more reason for it hereafter mrs bargrave then to satisfy her importunity was going to fetch a pen and ink but

world usually depend upon numbers of men it cannot be expected they should all unite to cross their inclinations from pursuing a general design wherein they unanimously agree besides the influence of the stars reaches to many actions and events which are not any way in the power of reason as sickness death and what we commonly call accidents with many more needless to repeat but now it is time to proceed to my predictions which i have begun to calculate from the time that the sun enters into aries and this i take to be properly the beginning of the natural year i pursue them to the time that he enters libra or somewhat more which is the busy period of the year the remainder i have not yet adjusted upon account of several impediments needless here to mention besides i must remind the reader again that this is but a specimen of what i design in succeeding years to treat more at large if i may have liberty and encouragement my first prediction is but a trifle yet i will mention it

lighted up by a gleam of successful management not to say with hopes and wishes that it will hardly do to dwell on could not but be revolting to a youth of harry mulford s generous feelings and most of all to one who entertained the sentiments which he was quite conscious of entertaining for rose budd the young man made no reply but turned his face toward the water in order to conceal the expression of disgust that he was sensible must be strongly depicted on it the river as the well known arm of the sea in which the swash was lying is erroneously termed was just at that moment unusually clear of craft and not a sail larger than that of a boat was to be seen between the end of blackwell s island and corlaer s hook a distance of about a league this stagnation in the movement of the port at that particular point was owing to the state of wind and tide of the first there was little more than a southerly air while the last was about two thirds ebb nearly everything that was expected on that tide coast wise and by the way of the sound had already arrived and nothing could go eastward with that light breeze and under canvas until the flood made of course it was different with the steamers who were paddling about like so many ducks steering in all directions though mostly crossing and re crossing at the ferries just as mulford turned away from his commander however a large vessel of that class shoved her bows into the view doubling the hook and going eastward the first glance at this vessel sufficed to drive even rose budd momentarily out of the minds of both master and mate and to give a new current to their thoughts spike had been on the point of walking up the wharf but he now so far changed his purpose as actually to jump on board of the brig and spring up alongside of his mate on the taffrail in order to get a better look at the steamer mulford who loathed so much in his commander was actually glad of this spike s rare merit as a seaman forming a sort of attraction that held him as it might be against his own will bound to his service what will they do next harry exclaimed the master his manner and voice actually humanized in air and

because i know you have a fond brother oh says mrs veal i gave my brother the slip and came away because i had so great a desire to see you before i took my journey so mrs bargrave went in with her into another room within the first and mrs veal sat her down in an elbow chair in which mrs bargrave was sitting when she heard mrs veal knock then says mrs veal my dear friend i am come to renew our old friendship again and beg your pardon for my breach of it and if you can forgive me you are the best of women o says mrs bargrave do not mention such a thing i have not had an uneasy thought about it i can easily forgive it what did you think of me said mrs veal says mrs bargrave i thought you were like the rest of the world and that prosperity had made you forget yourself and me then mrs veal reminded mrs bargrave of the many friendly offices she did her in former days and much of the conversation they had with each other in the times of their adversity what books they read and what comfort in particular they received from drelincourt s book of death which was the best she said on that subject ever written she also mentioned dr sherlock the two dutch books which were translated written upon death and several others but drelincourt she said had the clearest notions of death and of the future state of any who had handled that subject then she asked mrs bargrave whether she had drelincourt she said yes says mrs veal fetch it and so mrs bargrave goes up stairs and brings it down says mrs veal dear mrs bargrave if the eyes of our faith were as open as the eyes of our body we should see numbers of angels about us for our guard the notions we have of heaven now are nothing like what it is as drelincourt says therefore be comforted under your afflictions and believe that the almighty has a particular regard to you and that your afflictions are marks of god s favour and when they have done the business they are sent for they shall be removed from you and believe me my dear friend believe what i say to you one minute of future happiness will infinitely reward you for all your sufferings for i can never believe and claps her hand upon her knee with great earnestness which indeed ran through most of her discourse that ever god will suffer you to spend all your days in this afflicted state but be assured that your afflictions shall leave you or you them in a short time she spake in that pathetical and heavenly manner that mrs bargrave wept several times she was so deeply affected with it then mrs veal mentioned dr kenrick s ascetick at the end of which he gives an account of the lives of the primitive christians their pattern she recommended to our imitation and said their conversation was not like this of our age for now says she there is nothing but frothy vain discourse which is far different from theirs theirs was to edification and to build one another up in faith so that they were not as we are nor are we as they were but says she we ought to do as they did there was an hearty friendship among them but where is it now to be found says mrs bargrave it is hard indeed to find a true friend in these days says mrs veal mr norris has a fine copy of verses called friendship in perfection which i wonderfully admire have you seen the book says mrs veal no says mrs bargrave but i have the verses of my own writing out have you says mrs veal then fetch them which she did from above stairs and offered them to mrs veal to read who refused and waived the thing saying holding down her head would make it ache and then desired mrs bargrave to read them to her which she did as they were admiring friendship mrs veal said dear mrs bargrave i shall love you for ever in these verses there is twice used the word elysian ah says mrs veal these poets have such names for heaven she would often draw her hand across her own eyes and say mrs bargrave do not you think i am mightily impaired by my fits no says mrs bargrave i think you look as well as ever i knew you after all this discourse which the apparition put in much finer words than mrs bargrave said she could pretend to and as much more than she can remember for it cannot be thought that an hour and three quarters conversation could all be retained though the main of it she thinks she does she said to mrs bargrave she would have her write a letter to her brother and tell him she would have him give rings to such and such and that there was a purse of gold in her cabinet and that she would have two broad pieces given to her cousin watson talking at this rate mrs bargrave thought that a fit was coming upon her and so placed herself in a chair just before her knees to keep her from falling to the ground if her fits should occasion it for the elbow chair she thought would keep her from falling on either side and to divert mrs veal as she thought took hold of her gown sleeve several times and commended it mrs veal told her it was a scowered silk and newly made up but for all this mrs veal persisted in her request and told mrs bargrave she must not deny her and she would have her tell her brother all their conversation when she had opportunity dear mrs veal says mrs bargrave this seems so impertinent that i cannot tell how to comply with it and what a mortifying story will our conversation be to a young gentleman why says mrs bargrave it is much better methinks to do it yourself no says mrs veal though it seems impertinent to you now you will see more reason for it hereafter mrs bargrave then to satisfy her importunity was going to fetch a pen and ink but mrs veal said let it alone now but do it when i am gone but you must be sure to do it which was one of the last things she enjoine,1

amendment by precept or example and so it has proved for instead of seeing a full stop put to all abuses and corruptions at least in this little island as i had reason to expect behold after above six months warning i cannot learn that my book has produced one single effect according to my intentions i desired you would let me know by a letter when party and faction were extinguished judges learned and upright pleaders honest and modest with some tincture of common sense and smithfield blazing with pyramids of law books the young nobility x x s education entirely changed the physicians banished the female yahoos abounding in virtue honour truth and good sense courts and levees of great ministers thoroughly weeded and swept wit merit and learning rewarded all disgracers of the press in prose and verse condemned to eat nothing but their own cotton and quench their thirst with their own ink these and a thousand other reformations i firmly counted upon by your encouragement as indeed they were plainly deducible from the precepts delivered in my book and it must be owned that seven months were a sufficient time to correct every vice and folly to which yahoos are subject if their natures had been capable of the least disposition to virtue or wisdom yet so far have you been from answering my expectation in any of your letters that on the contrary you are loading our carrier every week with libels and keys and reflections and memoirs and second parts wherein i see myself accused of reflecting upon great state folk of degrading human nature for so they have still the confidence to style it and of abusing the female sex i find likewise that the writers of those bundles are not agreed among themselves for some of them will not allow me to be the author of my own travels and others make me author of books to which i am wholly a stranger i find likewise that your printer has been so careless as to confound the times and mistake the dates of my several voyages and returns neither assigning the true year nor the true month nor day of the month and i hear the original manuscript is all destroyed since the publication of my book neither have i any copy left however i have sent you some corrections which you may insert if ever there should be a second edition and yet i cannot stand to them but shall leave that matter to my judicious and candid readers to adjust it as they please i hear some of our sea yahoos find fault with my sea language as not proper in many parts nor now in use i cannot help it in my first voyages while i was young i was instructed by the oldest mariners and learned to speak as they did but i have since found that the sea yahoos are apt like the land ones to become new fangled in their words which the latter change every year insomuch as i remember upon each return to my own country their old dialect was so altered that i could hardly understand the new and i observe when any yahoo comes from london out of curiosity to visit me at my house we neither of us are able to deliver our conceptions in a manner intelligible to the other if the censure of the yahoos could any way affect me i should have great reason to complain that some of them are so bold as to think my book of travels a mere fiction out of mine own brain and have gone so far as to drop hints that the houyhnhnms and yahoos have no more existence than the inhabitants of utopia indeed i must confess that as to the people of lilliput brobdingrag for so the word should have been spelt and not erroneously brobdingnag and laputa i have never yet heard of any yahoo so presumptuous as to dispute their being or the facts i have related concerning them because the truth immediately strikes every reader with conviction and is there less probability in my account of the houyhnhnms or yahoos when it is manifest as to the latter there are so many thousands even in this country who only differ from their brother brutes in houyhnhnmland because they use a sort of jabber and do not go naked i wrote for their amendment and not their approbation the united praise of the whole race would be of less consequence to me than the neighing of those two degenerate houyhnhnms i keep in my stable because from these degenerate as they are i still improve in some virtues without any mixture of vice do these miserable animals presume to think that i am so degenerated as to defend my veracity yahoo as i am it is well known through all houyhnhnmland that by the instructions and example of my illustrious master i was able in the compass of two years although i confess with the utmost difficulty to remove that infernal habit of lying shuffling deceiving and equivocating so deeply rooted in the very souls of all my species especially the europeans i have other complaints to make upon this vexatious occasion but i forbear troubling myself or you any further i must freely confess that since my last return some corruptions of my yahoo nature have revived in me by conversing with a few of your species and particularly those of my own family by an unavoidable necessity else i should never have attempted so absurd a project as that of reforming

where was a den and laid me down in that place to sleep and as i slept i dreamed a dream i dreamed and behold i saw a man clothed with rags standing in a certain place with his face from his own house a book in his hand and a great burden upon his back i looked and saw him open the book and read therein and as he read he wept and trembled and not being able longer to contain he brake out with a lamentable cry saying what shall i do bedford jail in which bunyan was twelve years a prisoner in this plight therefore he went home and restrained himself as long as he could that his wife and children should not perceive his distress but he could not be silent long because that his trouble increased wherefore at length he brake his mind to his wife and children and thus he began to talk to them oh my dear wife said he and you my sweet children i your dear friend am in myself undone by reason of a burden that lieth hard upon me moreover i am told to a certainty that this our city will be burned with fire from heaven in which fearful overthrow both myself with thee my wife and you my sweet babes shall miserably come to ruin except some way of escape can be found whereby we may be delivered at this all his family were sore amazed not for that they believed that what he had said to them was true but because they thought that some frenzy or madness had got into his head therefore it drawing towards night and they hoping that sleep might settle his brain with all haste they got him to bed but the night was as troublesome to him as the day wherefore instead of sleeping he spent it in sighs and tears so when the morning was come they would know how he did he told them worse and worse he also set to talking to them again but they began to be hardened they also thought to drive away his madness by harsh and surly treatment of him sometimes they would ridicule sometimes they would chide and sometimes they would quite neglect him wherefore he began to retire himself to his chamber to pray for and pity them and also to sorrow over his own misery he would also walk solitary in the fields sometimes reading and sometimes praying and thus for some days he spent his time sidenote christian s distress of mind now i saw upon a time when he was walking in the fields that he was as he was wont reading in his book and greatly distressed in his mind and as he read he burst out as he had done before crying what shall i do to be saved i saw also that he looked this way and that way as if he would run yet he stood still because as i perceived he could not tell which way to go i looked then and saw a man named evangelist coming to him who asked wherefore dost thou cry illustration evangelist points to wicket gate page he answered sir i read in the book in my hand that i am condemned to die and after that to come to judgment and i find that i am not willing to do the first nor able to do the second then said evangelist why not willing to die since this life is troubled with so many evils the man answered because i fear that this burden that is upon my back will sink me lower than the grave and i shall fall into tophet and sir if i be not fit to go to prison i am not fit to go to judgment and from thence to death and the thoughts of these things make me cry tophet here means hell then said evangelist if this be thy condition why standest thou still he answered because i know not whither to go then he gave him a parchment roll and there was written within flee from the wrath to come the man therefore read it and looking upon evangelist very carefully said whither must i fly then said evangelist pointing with his finger over a very wide field do you see yonder wicket gate the man said no then said the other do you see yonder shining light he said i think i do then said evangelist keep that light in your eye and go up directly thereto so shalt thou see the gate at which when thou knockest it shall be told thee what thou shalt do so i saw in my dream that the man began to run now he had not run far from his own door when his wife and children perceiving it began to cry after him to return but the man put his fingers in his ears and ran on crying life life eternal life so he looked not behind him but fled towards the middle of the plain sidenote christian flees from the city the neighbors also came out to see him run and as he ran some mocked others threatened and some cried after him to return and among those that did so there were two that resolved to fetch him back by force the name of the one was obstinate and the name of the other pliable now by this time the man was got a good distance from them but however they were resolved to pursue him which they did and in a little time they overtook him then said the man neighbors wherefore are ye come they said to persuade you to go back with us but he said that can by no means be you dwell said he in the city of destruction the place also where i was born i see it to be so and dying there sooner or later you will sink lower than the grave into a place that burns with fire and brimstone be content good neighbors and go along with me obst what said obstinate and leave our friends and comforts behind us chris yes said christian for that was his name because that all which you forsake is not worthy to be compared with a little of that i am seeking to enjoy and

to forbear quirking and mocking for that i say mr badman is dead but rather gravely enquire concerning thy self by the word whether thou art one of his linage or no for mr badman has left many of his relations behind him yea the very world is overspread with his kindred true some of his relations as he are gone to their place and long home but thousands of thousands are left behind as brothers

laid upon it yea our earth reels and staggereth to and fro like a drunkard the transgression thereof is heavy upon it courteous reader i will treat thee now even at the door and threshold of this house but only with this intelligence that mr badman lies dead within be pleased therefore if thy leisure will serve thee to enter in and behold the state in which he is laid betwixt his death bed and the grave he is not buried as yet nor doth he stink as is designed he shall before he lies down in oblivion now as others have had their funerals solemnized according to their greatness and grandure in the world so likewise mr badman forasmuch as he deserveth not to go down to his grave with silence has his funeral state according to his deserts four things are usual at great mens funerals which we will take leave and i hope without offence to allude to in the funeral of mr badman first they are sometimes when dead presented to their friends by their compleatly wrought images as lively as by cunning mens hands they can be that the remembrance of them may be renewed to their survivors the remembrance of them and their deeds and this i have endeavoured to answer in my discourse of mr badman and therefore i have drawn him forth in his featours and actions from his childhood to his gray hairs here therefore thou hast him lively set forth as in cutts both as to the minority flower and seniority of his age together with those actions of his life that he was most capable of doing in and under those present circumstances of time place strength and the opportunities that did attend him in these secondly there is also usual at great mens funerals those badges and scutcheons of their honour that they have received from their ancestors or have been thought worthy of for the deeds and exploits they have done in their life and here mr badman has his but such as vary from all men of worth but so much the more agreeing with the merit of his doings they all have descended in state he only as an abominable branch his deserts are the deserts of sin and therefore the scutcheons of honour that he has are only that he died without honour and at his end became a fool thou shalt not be joyned with them in burial the seed of evil doers shall never be renowned the funeral pomp therefore of mr badman is to wear upon his hearse the badges of a dishonourable and wicked life since his bones are full of the sins of his youth which shall lye down as job sayes in the dust with him nor is it fit that any should be his attendants now at his death but such as with him conspired against their own souls in their life persons whose transgressions have made them infamous to all that have or shall know what they have done some notice therefore i have also here in this little discourse given the reader of them who were his confederates in his life and attendants at his death with a hint either of some high villany committed by them as also of those judgments that have overtaken and fallen upon them from the just and revenging hand of god all which are things either fully known by me as being eye and ear witness thereto or that i have received from such hands whose relation as to this i am bound to believe and that the reader may know them from other things and passages herein contained i have pointed at them in the margent,1

weeks although it was at a time of the year when usually the bills are very moderate the usual number of burials within the bills of mortality for a week was from about or thereabouts to the last was esteemed a pretty high bill but after this we found the bills successively increasing as follows buried increased december the th to the th th rd january january the rd th th th th th this last bill was really frightful being a higher number than had been known to have been buried in one week since the preceding visitation of however all this went off again and the weather proving cold and the frost which began in december still continuing very severe even till near the end of february attended with sharp though moderate winds the bills decreased again and the city grew healthy and everybody began to look upon the danger as good as over only that still the burials in st giles s continued high from the beginning of april especially they stood at twenty five each week till the week from the th to the th when there was buried in st giles s parish thirty whereof two of the plague and eight of the spotted fever which was looked upon as the same thing likewise the number that died of the spotted fever in the whole increased being eight the week before and twelve the week above named this alarmed us all again and terrible apprehensions were among the people especially the weather being now changed and growing warm and the summer being at hand however the next week there seemed to be some hopes again the bills were low the number of the dead in all was but there was none of the plague and but four of the spotted fever but the following week it returned again and the distemper was spread into two or three other parishes viz st andrew s holborn st clement danes and to the great affliction of the city one died within the walls in the parish of st mary woolchurch that is to say in bearbinder lane near stocks market in all there were nine of the plague and six of the spotted fever it was however upon inquiry found that this frenchman who died in bearbinder lane was one who having lived in long acre near the infected houses had removed for fear of the distemper not knowing that he was already infected this was the beginning of may yet the weather was temperate variable and cool enough and people had still some hopes that which encouraged them was that the city was healthy the whole ninety seven parishes buried but fifty four and we began to hope that as it was chiefly among the people at that end of the town it might go no farther and the rather because the next week which was from the th of may to the th there died but three of which not one within the whole city or liberties and st andrew s buried but fifteen which was very low tis true st giles s buried two and thirty but still as there was but one of the plague people began to be easy the whole bill also was very low for the week before the bill was but and the week above mentioned but we continued in these hopes for a few days but it was but for a few for the people were no more to be deceived thus they searched the houses and found that the plague was really spread every way and that many died of it every day so that now all our extenuations abated and it was no more to be concealed nay it quickly appeared that the infection had spread itself beyond all hopes of abatement that in the parish of st giles it was gotten into several streets and several families lay all sick together and accordingly in the weekly bill for the next week the thing began to show itself there was indeed but fourteen set down of the plague but this was all knavery and collusion for in st giles s parish they buried forty in all whereof it was certain most of them died of the plague though they were set down of other distempers and though the number of all the burials were not increased above thirty two and the whole bill being but yet there was fourteen of the spotted fever as well as fourteen of the plague and we took it for granted upon the whole that there were fifty died that week of the plague the next bill was from the rd of may to the th when the number of the plague was seventeen but the burials in st giles s were fifty three a frightful number of whom they set down but nine of the plague but on an examination more strictly by the justices of peace and at the lord mayor s request it was found there were twenty more who were really dead of the plague in that parish but had been set down of the spotted fever or other distempers besides others concealed but those were trifling things to what followed immediately after for now the weather set in hot and from the first week in june the infection spread in a dreadful manner and the bills rose high the articles of the fever spotted fever and teeth began to swell for all that could conceal their distempers did it to prevent their neighbours shunning and refusing to converse with them and also to prevent authority shutting up their houses which though it was not yet practised yet was threatened and people were extremely terrified at the thoughts of it the second week in june the parish of st giles where still the weight of the infection lay buried whereof though the bills said but sixty eight of the plague everybody said there had been at least calculating it from the usual number of funerals in that parish as above till this week the city continued free there having never any died e,1

it now ceased to be so almost completely with the support which such methods secured along with encouragement from his ministers the king was prepared to put in operation his policy for regulating the affairs of america writs of assistance were followed by the passage of the stamp act the ostensible object of both these measures was to help pay the debt incurred by the french war but the real purpose lay deeper and was nothing more or less than the ultimate extension of parliamentary rule in great things as well as small to america at this crisis so momentous for the colonists the rockingham ministry was formed and burke together with pitt supported a motion for the unconditional repeal of the stamp act after much wrangling the motion was carried and the first blunder of the mother country seemed to have been smoothed over only a few months elapsed however when the question of taxing the colonies was revived pitt lay ill and could take no part in the proposed measure through the influence of other members of his party notably townshend a series of acts were passed imposing duties on several exports to america this was followed by a suspension of the new york assembly because it had disregarded instructions in the matter of supplies for the troops the colonists were furious matters went from bad to worse to withdraw as far as possible without yielding the principle at stake the duties on all the exports mentioned in the bill were removed except that on tea but it was precisely the principle for which the colonists were contending they were not in the humor for compromise when they believed their freedom was endangered and the strength and determination of their resistance found a climax in the boston tea party in the meantime lord north who was absolutely obedient to the king had become prime minister five bills were prepared the tenor of which it was thought would overawe the colonists of these the boston port bill and the regulating act are perhaps the most famous though the ultimate tendency of all was blindly coercive while the king and his friends were busy with these the opposition proposed an unconditional repeal of the tea act the bill was introduced only to be overwhelmingly defeated by the same parliament that passed the five measures of lord north in america the effect of these proceedings was such as might have been expected by thinking men the colonies were as a unit in their support of massachusetts the regulating act was set at defiance public officers in the king s service were forced to resign town meetings were held and preparations for war were begun in dead earnest to avert this some of england s greatest statesmen pitt among the number asked for a reconsideration on february the first a bill was introduced which would have gone far toward bringing peace one month later burke delivered his speech on conciliation with the colonies edmund burke there is nothing unusual in burke s early life he was born in dublin ireland in his father was a successful lawyer and a protestant his mother a catholic at the age of twelve he became a pupil of abraham shackleton a quaker who had been teaching some fifteen years at ballitore a small town thirty miles from dublin in after years burke was always pleased to speak of his old friend in the kindest way if i am anything he declares it is the education i had there that has made me so and again at shackleton s death when burke was near the zenith of his fame and popularity he writes i had a true honor and affection for that excellent man i feel something like a satisfaction in the midst of my concern that i was fortunate enough to have him under my roof before his departure it can hardly be doubted that the old quaker schoolmaster succeeded with his pupil who was already so favorably inclined and it is more than probable that the daily example of one who lived out his precepts was strong in its influence upon a young and generous mind burke attended school at ballitore two years then at the age of fourteen he became a student at trinity college dublin and remained there five years at college he was unsystematic and careless of routine he seems to have done pretty much as he pleased and however methodical he became in after life his study during these five years was rambling and spasmodic the only definite knowledge we have of this period is given by burke himself in letters to his former friend richard shackleton son of his old schoolmaster what he did was done with a zest that at times became a feverish impatience first i was greatly taken with natural philosophy which while i should have given my mind to logic employed me incessantly this i call my furor mathematicus following in succession come his furor logicus furor historicus and furor peoticus each of which absorbed him for the time being it would be wrong however to think of burke as a trifler even in his youth he read in the library three hours every day and we may be sure he read as intelligently as eagerly it is more than probable that like a few other great minds he did not need a rigid system to guide him if he chose his subjects of study at pleasure there is every reason to believe he mastered them of intimate friends at the university we hear nothing goldsmith came one year later but there is no evidence that they knew each other it is probable that burke always reserved had little in common with his young associates his own musings with occasional attempts at writing poetry long walks through the country and frequent letters to and from richard shackleton employed him when not at his books two years after taking his degree burke went to london and established himself at the middle temple for the u,1

engage in religious controversy and the furious contest civil and ecclesiastical which ensued on the accession of queen anne gave him an opportunity of gratifying his favourite passion he therefore published a tract entitled the shortest way with the dissenters or proposals for the establishment of the church which contained an ironical recommendation of persecution but written in so serious a strain that many persons particularly dissenters at first mistook its real intention the high church party however saw and felt the ridicule and by their influence a prosecution was commenced against him and a proclamation published in the gazette offering a reward for his apprehension when de foe found with how much rigour himself and his pamphlet were about to be treated he at first secreted himself but his printer and bookseller being taken into custody he surrendered being resolved as he expresses it to throw himself upon the favour of government rather than that others should be ruined for his mistakes in july he was brought to trial found guilty and sentenced to be imprisoned to stand in the pillory and to pay a fine of two hundred marks he underwent the infamous part of the punishment with great fortitude and it seems to have been generally thought that he was treated with unreasonable severity so far was he from being ashamed of his fate himself that he wrote a hymn to

newgate his family ruined and himself without hopes of deliverance till sir robert harley who approved of his principles and foresaw that during a factious age such a genius could be converted to many uses represented his unmerited sufferings to the queen and at length procured his release the treasurer lord godolphin also sent a considerable sum to his wife and family and to him money to pay his fine and the expense of his discharge gratitude and fidelity are inseparable from an honest man and it was this benevolent act that prompted de foe to support harley with his able and ingenious pen when anne lay lifeless and his benefactor in the vicissitude of party was persecuted by faction and overpowered though not conquered by violence the talents and perseverance of de foe began now to be properly estimated and as a firm supporter of the administration he was sent by lord godolphin to scotland on an errand which as he says was far from being unfit for a sovereign to direct or an honest man to perform his knowledge of commerce and revenue his powers of insinuation and above all his readiness of pen were deemed of no small utility in promoting the union of the two kingdoms of which he wrote an able history in with two dedications one to the queen and another to the duke of queensbury soon afterwards he unhappily by some equivocal writings rendered himself suspected by both parties so that he once more retired to newington in hopes of spending the remainder of his days in peace his pension being withdrawn and wearied with politics he began to compose works of a different kind the year may therefore be regarded as the period of de foe s political life faction henceforth found other advocates and parties procured other writers to disseminate their suggestions and to propagate their falsehoods in de foe published the family instructor a work inculcating the domestic duties in a lively manner by narration and dialogue and displaying much knowledge of life in the

words be for the pretender and this can be no otherwise understood than to have a design however remote and upon whatever views to bring him in to possess the throne of these kingdoms the matter then being laid down thus as sincerely and plainly as possible we come to the question point blank and think it our duty to say with the greatest sincerity that we do not believe the ministry are in any kind or with any prospect near or remote acting for or with a design or view to bring in the pretender having granted this we must however to prevent any breaking in by way of cavil on one hand or triumph on the other subjoin immediately that we do not in the least grant by this that the protestant succession is in no danger even from several of the measures now taken in the world it is far from any reflection upon the ministry to say that however they may act upon a right sincere principle for the protestant succession in all they do which as above we profess to believe yet that many of the tools they make use of are of another make and have no edge to cut any other way no thoughts to move them towards any other end no other centre which they can have any tendency to that the pretender s interest is the magnet which draws them by its secret influence to point to him as their pole that they have their aim at his establishment here and own it to be their aim and as they are not shy to profess it among themselves so their conduct in many things makes it sufficiently public this is not meant as any reflection upon the ministry for making use of such men the late ministry did the same and every ministry will and must employ men sometimes not as they always join with them in their politic principles but as either the men are found useful in their several employments or as the ministry may be under other circumstances which makes it necessary to them to employ them nor as the review well enough observed does it follow that because the ministry have employed or joined with jacobites in the public affairs that therefore they must have done it with a jacobite principle but let the ministry employ these men by what necessity or upon what occasion they will though it may not follow that the ministry are therefore for the pretender yet it does not also follow that there is no danger of the protestant succession from the employing those sort of people for what if the queen should die the ministry it is hoped are established in the interest of their queen and country and therefore it has been argued that supposing the ministry had the pretender in their eye yet that it is irrational to suggest that they can have any such view during the life of her present majesty nay even those professed jacobites who we spoke of just now cannot be so ungrateful to think of deposing the queen who has been so bountiful so kind so exceeding good to them as in several cases to suffer them to be brought into the management of her own affairs when by their character they might have been thought dangerous even to her person thus winning and engaging them by her bounty and the confidence that has been placed in them not to attempt anything to her prejudice without the most monstrous ingratitude without flying in the face of all that sense of honour and obligation which it is possible for men of common sense to entertain and it can hardly be thought that even papists themselves under the highest possessions of their religious zeal can conquer the native aversions they must have to such abominable ingratitude or to think of bringing in the pretender upon this protestant nation even while the queen shall be on the throne but though this may and some doubt that also tie up their hands during the queen s life yet they themselves give us but small reason to expect anything from them afterward and it will be hard to find anybody to vouch for them then these very jacobites papists and professed enemies to the revolution may be supposed upon these pretensions to be quiet and offer no violence to the present establishment while her majesty has the possession and while that life lasts to which they are so much indebted for her royal goodness and clemency but what would they do if the queen should die come we next to the french king we are told that not the french king only but even the whole french nation are wonderfully forward to acknowledge the obligation they are under to the justice and favour which they have received from her majesty in the putting an end to the war a war which lay heavy upon them and threatened the very name of the french nation with ruin and much more threatened the glory of the french court and of their great monarch with an entire overthrow a total eclipse a war which by their own confession it was impossible for them long to have supported the expenses of and which by the great superiority of the allies became dreadful to them and that every campaign more than the other a war which they were in such pain to see the end of that they tried all the powers and courts in christendom who were the least neutral to engage a mediation in order to a treaty and all in vain and a war which if her majesty had not inclined to put an end to must have ended perhaps to the disadvantage and confusion of both france and spain if not of all christendom the obligations the french are under for the bringing this war to so just and honourable a conclusion are not at all concealed nay the french themselves have not been backward to make them public the declarations made by the french king of his sincerity in the overtures made for a general peace the protestations of his being resolved to enter into an entire confidence and a league offensive and defensive with the queen s majesty for the

on the next young flood and i hope you ll have all the hands aboard in time i see two or three of them up at that dutch beer house this moment and can tell em in plain language if they come here with their beer aboard them they ll have to go ashore again you have an uncommonly sober crew capt spike answered the young man with great calmness during the whole time i have been with them i have not seen a man among them the least in the wind well i hope it will turn out that i ve an uncommonly sober mate in the bargain drunkenness i abominate mr mulford and i can tell you short metre that i will not stand it may i inquire if you ever saw me the least in the world under the influence of liquor capt spike demanded the mate rather than asked with a very fixed meaning in his manner i keep no log

young flood and that rose budd and the good lady her aunt take passage in her this v y ge is it possible that you have persuaded them into that at last exclaimed the handsome mate persuaded it takes

the sea for her constitution rose budd has no more of a pulmonary constitution than i have myself interrupted the mate well that s as people fancy you must know mr mulford they ve got all sorts of diseases now a days and all sorts of cures for em one sort of a cure for consumption is what they tarm the hyder ally i think you must mean hydropathy sir well it s something of the sort no matter what but cold water is at the bottom of it and they do say it s a good remedy now rose s aunt thinks if cold water is what is wanted there is no place where it can be so plenty as out on the ocean sea air is good too and by taking a v y ge her niece will get both requisites together and cheap does rose budd think herself consumptive capt spike asked mulford with interest not she you know it will

the aunt the cunning thing knows all about it mulford almost nauseated the expression of his commander s countenance while spike uttered the last words at no time was that countenance very inviting the features being coarse and vulgar while the color of the entire face was of an ambiguous red in which liquor and the seasons would seem to be blended in very equal quantities such a countenance lighted up by a gleam of successful management not to say with hopes and wishes that it will hardly do to dwell on could not but be revolting to a youth of harry mulford s generous feelings and most of all to one who entertained the sentiments which he was quite conscious of entertaining for rose budd the young man made no reply but turned his face toward the water in order to conceal the expression of disgust that he was sensible must be strongly depicted on it the river as the well known arm of the sea in which the swash was lying is erroneously termed was just at that moment unusually clear of craft and not a sail larger than that of a boat was to be seen between the end of blackwell s island and corlaer s hook a distance of about a league this stagnation in the movement of the port at that particular point was owing to the state of wind and tide of the first there was little more than a southerly air while the last was about two thirds ebb nearly everything that was expected on that tide coast wise and by the way of the sound had already arrived and nothing could go eastward with that light breeze and under canvas until the flood made of course it was different with the steamers who were paddling about like so many ducks steering in all directions though mostly crossing and re crossing at the ferries just as mulford turned away from his commander however a large vessel of that class shoved her bows into the view doubling the hook and going eastward the first glance at this vessel sufficed to drive even rose budd momentarily out of the minds of both master and mate and to give a new current to their thoughts spike had been on the point of walking up the wharf but he now so far changed his purpose as actually to jump on board of the brig and spring up alongside of his mate on the taffrail in order to get a better look at the steamer mulford who loathed so much in his commander was actually glad of this spike s rare merit as a seaman forming a sort of attraction that held him as it might be against his own will bound to his service what will they do next harry exclaimed the master his manner and voice actually humanized in air and

and verse condemned to eat nothing but their own cotton and quench their thirst with their own ink these and a thousand other reformations i firmly counted upon by your encouragement as indeed they were plainly deducible from the precepts delivered in my book and it must be owned that seven months were a sufficient time to correct every vice and folly to which yahoos are subject if their natures had been capable of the least disposition to virtue or wisdom yet so far have you been from answering my expectation in any of your letters that on the contrary you are loading our carrier every week with libels and keys and reflections and memoirs and second parts wherein i see myself accused of reflecting upon great state folk of degrading human nature for so they have still the confidence to style it and of abusing the female sex i find likewise that the writers of those bundles are not agreed among themselves for some of them will not allow me to be the author of my own travels and others make me author of books to which i am wholly a stranger i find likewise that your printer has been so careless as to confound the times and mistake the dates of my several voyages and returns neither assigning the true year nor the true month nor day of the month and i hear the original manuscript is all destroyed since the publication of my book neither have i any copy left however i have sent you some corrections which you may insert if ever there should be a second edition and yet i cannot stand to them but shall leave that matter to my judicious and candid readers to adjust it as they please i hear some of our sea yahoos find fault with my sea language as not proper in many parts nor now in use i cannot help it in my first voyages while i was young i was instructed by the oldest mariners and learned to speak as they did but i have since found that the sea yahoos are apt like the land ones to become new fangled in their words which the latter change every year insomuch as i remember upon each return to my own country their old dialect was so altered that i could hardly understand the new and i observe when any yahoo comes from london out of curiosity to visit me at my house we neither of us are able to deliver our conceptions in a manner intelligible to the other if the censure of the yahoos could any way affect me i should have great reason to complain that some of them are so bold as to think my book of travels a mere fiction out of mine own brain and have gone so far as to drop hints that the houyhnhnms and yahoos have no more existence than the inhabitants of utopia indeed i must confess that as to the people of lilliput brobdingrag for so the word should have been spelt and not erroneously brobdingnag and laputa i have never yet heard of any yahoo so presumptuous as to dispute their being or the facts i have related concerning them because the truth immediately strikes every reader with conviction and is there less probability in my account of the houyhnhnms or yahoos when it is manifest as to the latter there are so many thousands even in this country who only differ from their brother brutes in houyhnhnmland because they use a sort of jabber and do not go naked i wrote for their amendment and not their approbation the united praise of the whole race would be of less consequence to me than the neighing of those two degenerate houyhnhnms i keep in my stable because from these degenerate as they are i still improve in some virtues without any mixture of vice do these miserable animals presume to think that i am so degenerated as to defend my veracity yahoo as i am it is well known through all houyhnhnmland that by the instructions and example of my illustrious master i was able in the compass of two years

of the true meaning of the way of god in the whirle wind and in the storm the design of this discourse therefore is to put the nation in general upon proper resolutions if we pretend to believe that there is any such thing as a collateral sympathy a communication of circumstances between a nations follies and her fate any harmony between merit and mischief between the crimes of men and the vengeance of heaven we cannot but allow this extra pulpit admonition to be just and let not any man object against this being call d a sermon and its being introduc d from a text of scripture while the remainer of this discourse seems wholly civil and political if all our measures in civil affairs were deduc d as inferences from sacred texts i am of the opinion the text would be well improv d and publick matters never the worse guided and for this reason tho the subject be not treated with the gravity of a sermon nor in so serious a manner as would become a pulpit yet it may be not the less suitable to the occasion and for the manner it must be placed to the authors account besides the title i think has provided for the method and if so he that expected it otherwise than it is tis his fault and not mine the term sermon which is but sermo a speech may justify all the novelty of my method if those who find fault please to give themselves leave to allow it and since it has never profain d the pulpit i believe the text will receive no prejudice by it i wish every sermon equally improv d and what tho your humble servant be no man of the text if he be a man of honesty he may have a hand in making you all men of application in publick callamities every circumstance is a sermon and every thing we see a preacher the trembling habitations of an unthinking people preach to us

scituation upon us thinks fit he can make that element which has been our strength and the encreaser of our wealth be the grave of our treasure and the enemy of our commerce he can put it into so violent agitation by the blast of his mouth that all our defence and the naval strength we have vallued our selves so much upon shall at once be swallow d up in the mouth of our friend the sea and we shall find our destruction in the very thing from which we expected our defence our seamen and soldiers whose dead bodies embrace the english shores preach aloud to us that whenever we think fit to embark them on any design which heaven approves not of he can blast the embrio and devour those people whose hands are lifted up against justice and right also they preach to us not to build our hopes of success upon the multitude of ships or men who are thus easily reduc d and the strength of a whole nation brought to ruine in a moment these are the monitors of our missfortunes and some of these admonitions would be well preach d from the mouths of those whose tallent as well as office gives them reason to do it and us to expect it but since the sons of the prophets have not yet thought it proper to enter very far into this matter not doubting but they will in due time find it as suitable to their inclination as tis to their duty in the mean time let us see if no uncommon application may be made of so uncommon a circumstance first tis matter of wonder that any man can be so senceless as to suppose there is nothing extraordinary in so signal an instance of a supream power but tis much more remarkable that those who have religion enough to own it a judgment are yet at a loss how to appropriate it s signification every one thinks it to be a judgment upon the person or parties

the king to consent to a bill for triennial parliaments when swift took up his residence at moor park he found there a little girl of eight daughter of a merchant named edward johnson who had died young swift says that esther johnson was born on march in the parish register of richmond which shows that she was baptized on march her name is given as hester but she signed her will esther the name by which she was always known swift says her father was a younger brother of a good family in nottinghamshire her mother of a lower degree and indeed she had little to boast in her birth mrs johnson had two children esther and ann and lived at moor park as companion to lady giffard temple s widowed sister another member of the household afterwards to be esther s constant companion was rebecca dingley a relative of the temple family she was a year or two older than swift the lonely young man of twenty two was both playfellow and teacher of the delicate child of eight how he taught her to write has been charmingly brought before us in the painting exhibited by miss dicksee at the royal academy a few years ago he advised her what books to read and instructed her as he says in the principles of honour and virtue from which she never swerved in any one action or moment of her life by swift had grown tired of his position and finding that temple who valued his services was slow in finding him preferment he left moor park in order to carry out his resolve to go into the church he was ordained and obtained the prebend of kilroot near belfast where he carried on a flirtation with a miss waring whom he called varina but in may temple made proposals which induced swift to return to moor park where he was employed in preparing temple s memoirs and correspondence for publication and in supporting the side taken by temple in the letters of phalaris controversy by writing the battle of the books which was however not published until on his return to temple s house swift found his old playmate grown from a sickly child into a girl of fifteen in perfect health she came he says to be looked upon as one of the most beautiful graceful and agreeable young women in london only a little too fat her hair was blacker than a raven and every feature of her face in perfection on his death in january temple left a will dated directing the payment of pounds each with half a year s wages to bridget johnson and all my other servants and leaving a lease of some land in monistown county wicklow to esther johnson servant to my sister giffard by a codicil of february temple left pounds to mr jonathan swift now living with me it may be added that by her will of proved in the following year lady giffard gave pounds to mrs moss mrs bridget johnson who had married richard mose or moss lady giffard s steward the will proceeds to mrs hester sic johnson i give pounds with the pounds i put into the exchequer for her life and my own and declare the pounds to be hers which i am told is there in my name upon the survivorship and for which she has constantly sent over her certificate and received the interest i give her besides my two little silver candlesticks temple left in swift s hands the task of publishing his posthumous works a duty which afterwards led to a quarrel with lady giffard and other members of the family many years later swift told lord palmerston that he stopped at moor park solely for the benefit of temple s conversation and advice and the opportunity of pursuing his studies at temple s death he was as far to seek as ever in the summer of however he was offered and accepted the post of secretary and chaplain to the earl of berkeley one of the lords justices but when he reached ireland he found that the secretaryship had been given to another he soon however obtained the living of laracor agher and rathbeggan and the prebend of dunlavin in st patrick s cathedral dublin the total value of these preferments was about pounds a year an income which miss waring seems to have thought enough to justify him in marrying swift s reply to the lady whom he had singled out at first from the rest of women could only have been written with the intention of breaking off the connection and accordingly we hear no more of poor varina at laracor a mile or two from trim and twenty miles from dublin swift ministered to a congregation of about fifteen persons and had abundant leisure for cultivating his garden making a canal after the dutch fashion of moor park planting willows and rebuilding the vicarage as chaplain to lord berkeley he spent much of his time in dublin he was on intimate terms with lady berkeley and her daughters one of whom is best known by her married name of lady betty germaine and through them he had access to the fashionable society of dublin when lord berkeley returned to england in april swift after taking his doctor s degree at dublin went with him and soon afterwards published anonymously a political pamphlet a discourse on the contests and dissentions in athens and rome when he returned to ireland in september he was accompanied by stella to give esther johnson the name by which she is best known and her friend mrs dingley stella s fortune was about pounds and the property temple had left her was in county wicklow swift very much for his own satisfaction who had few friends or acquaintance in ireland persuaded stella now twenty years old that living was cheaper there than in england and that a better return was obtainable on money the ladies took his advice and made ireland their home at first they felt themselves strangers in dublin the adventure looked so like a frolic,1

it now ceased to be so almost completely with the support which such methods secured along with encouragement from his ministers the king was prepared to put in operation his policy for regulating the affairs of america writs of assistance were followed by the passage of the stamp act the ostensible object of both these measures was to help pay the debt incurred by the french war but the real purpose lay deeper and was nothing more or less than the ultimate extension of parliamentary rule in great things as well as small to america at this crisis so momentous for the colonists the rockingham ministry was formed and burke together with pitt supported a motion for the unconditional repeal of the stamp act after much wrangling the motion was carried and the first blunder of the mother country seemed to have been smoothed over only a few months elapsed however when the question of taxing the colonies was revived pitt lay ill and could take no part in the proposed measure through the influence of other members of his party notably townshend a series of acts were passed imposing duties on several exports to america this was followed by a suspension of the new york assembly because it had disregarded instructions in the matter of supplies for the troops the colonists were furious matters went from bad to worse to withdraw as far as possible without yielding the principle at stake the duties on all the exports mentioned in the bill were removed except that on tea but it was precisely the principle for which the colonists were contending they were not in the humor for compromise when they believed their freedom was endangered and the strength and determination of their resistance found a climax in the boston tea party in the meantime lord north who was absolutely obedient to the king had become prime minister five bills were prepared the tenor of which it was thought would overawe the colonists of these the boston port bill and the regulating act are perhaps the most famous though the ultimate tendency of all was blindly coercive while the king and his friends were busy with these the opposition proposed an unconditional repeal of the tea act the bill was introduced only to be overwhelmingly defeated by the same parliament that passed the five measures of lord north in america the effect of these proceedings was such as might have been expected by thinking men the colonies were as a unit in their support of massachusetts the regulating act was set at defiance public officers in the king s service were forced to resign town meetings were held and preparations for war were begun in dead earnest to avert this some of england s greatest statesmen pitt among the number asked for a reconsideration on february the first a bill was introduced which would have gone far toward bringing peace one month later burke delivered his speech on conciliation with the colonies edmund burke there is nothing unusual in burke s early life he was born in dublin ireland in his father was a successful lawyer and a protestant his mother a catholic at the age of twelve he became a pupil of abraham shackleton a quaker who had been teaching some fifteen years at ballitore a small town thirty miles from dublin in after years burke was always pleased to speak of his old friend in the kindest way if i am anything he declares it is the education i had there that has made me so and again at shackleton s death when burke was near the zenith of his fame and popularity he writes i had a true honor and affection for that excellent man i feel something like a satisfaction in the midst of my concern that i was fortunate enough to have him under my roof before his departure it can hardly be doubted that the old quaker schoolmaster succeeded with his pupil who was already so favorably inclined and it is more than probable that the daily example of one who lived out his precepts was strong in its influence upon a young and generous mind burke attended school at ballitore two years then at the age of fourteen he became a student at trinity college dublin and remained there five years at college he was unsystematic and careless of routine he seems to have done pretty much as he pleased and however methodical he became in after life his study during these five years was rambling and spasmodic the only definite knowledge we have of this period is given by burke himself in letters to his former friend richard shackleton son of his old schoolmaster what he did was done with a zest that at times became a feverish impatience first i was greatly taken with natural philosophy which while i should have given my mind to logic employed me incessantly this i call my furor mathematicus following in succession come his furor logicus furor historicus and furor peoticus each of which absorbed him for the time being it would be wrong however to think of burke as a trifler even in his youth he read in the library three hours every day and we may be sure he read as intelligently as eagerly it is more than probable that like a few other great minds he did not need a rigid system to guide him if he chose his subjects of study at pleasure there is every reason to believe he mastered them of intimate friends at the university we hear nothing goldsmith came one year later but there is no evidence that they knew each other it is probable that burke always reserved had little in common with his young associates his own musings with occasional attempts at writing poetry long walks through the country and frequent letters to and from richard shackleton employed him when not at his books two years after taking his degree burke went to london and established himself at the middle temple for the u,1

lay dying and all stood like greyhounds on the slip and with what arrow swiftness they shot away when the great news came all this he has already described at wearisome length in his fantastic semi fabulous way bielfeld i ib friedrich himself seemed moderately glad to see bielfeld received his high flown congratulations with a benevolent yet somewhat composed air and gave him afterwards in the course of weeks an unexpectedly small appointment to go to hanover under truchsess von waldburg and announce our accession which is but a simple mostly formal service yet perhaps what bielfeld is best equal to the britannic majesty or at least his hanover people have been beforehand with this civility baron munchhausen no doubt by orders given for such contingency had appeared at berlin with the due compliment and condolence almost on the first day of the new reign first messenger of all on that errand britannic majesty evidently in a conciliatory humor having his dangerous spanish war on hand britannic majesty in person shortly after gets across to hanover and friedrich despatches truchsess with bielfeld adjoined to return the courtesy friedrich does not neglect these points of good manners along with which something of substantial may be privately conjoined for example if he had in secret his eye on julich and berg could anything be fitter than to ascertain what the french will think of such an enterprise what the french and next to them what the english that is to say hanoverians who meddle much in affairs of the reich for these reasons and others he likewise probably with more study than in the bielfeld case despatches colonel camas to make his compliment at the french court and in an expert way take soundings there camas a fat sedate military gentleman of advanced years full of observation experience and sound sense with one arm which he makes do the work of two and nobody can notice that the other arm resting in his coat breast is of cork so expert is he will do in this matter what is feasible probably not much for the present he is to call on voltaire as he passes who is in holland again at the hague for some months back and deliver him a little cask of hungary wine which probably his majesty had thought exquisite of which and the other insignificant passages between them we hear more than enough in the writings and correspondences of voltaire about this time in such way friedrich disposes of his bielfelds who are rather numerous about him now and henceforth adventurers from all quarters especially of the literary type in hopes of being employed much hovered round friedrich through his whole reign but they met a rather strict judge on arriving it cannot be said they found it such a goshen as they expected favor friendly intimacy it is visible from the first avails nothing with this young king beyond and before all things he will have his work done and looks out exclusively for the man ablest to do it hence bielfeld goes to hanover to grin out euphuisms and make graceful courtbows to our sublime little uncle there on the other hand friedrich institutes a new knighthood order of merit so called which indeed is but a small feat testifying mere hope and exuberance as yet and may even be made worse than nothing according to the knights he shall manage to have happily it proved a successful new order in this last all essential particular and to the end of friedrich s life continued to be a great and coveted distinction among the prussians beyond doubt this is a radiant enough young majesty entitled to hope and to be the cause of hope

nether tip one after one by the star dogged moon too quick for groan or sigh each turned his face with a ghastly pang and cursed me with his eye four times fifty living men and i heard nor sigh nor groan with heavy thump a lifeless lump they dropped down one by one the souls did from their bodies fly they fled to bliss or woe and every soul it passed me by like the whizz of my cross bow part the

not thou wedding guest this body dropt not down alone alone all all alone alone on a wide wide sea and never a saint took pity on my soul in agony the many men so beautiful and they all dead did lie and a thousand thousand slimy things lived on and so did i i looked upon the rotting sea and drew my eyes away i looked upon the rotting deck and there the dead men lay i looked to heaven and tried to pray but or ever a prayer had gusht a wicked whisper came and made my heart as dry as dust i closed my lids and kept them close and the balls like pulses beat for the sky and the sea and the sea and the sky lay like a load on my weary eye and the dead were at my feet the cold sweat melted from their limbs nor rot nor reek did they the look with which they looked on me had never passed away an orphan s curse would drag to hell a spirit from on high but oh more horrible than that is a curse in a dead man s eye seven days seven nights i saw that curse and yet i could not die the moving moon

water burnt alway a still and awful red beyond the shadow of the ship i watched the water snakes they moved in tracks of shining white and when they reared the elfish light fell off in hoary flakes within the shadow of the ship i watched their rich attire blue glossy green and velvet black they coiled and swam and every track was a flash of golden fire o happy living things no tongue their beauty might declare a spring of love gushed from my heart and i blessed them unaware sure my kind saint took pity on me and i blessed them unaware the self same moment i could pray and from my neck

time later fallen into an argument with one of his troopers concerning the mystery of the trinity the man who was a half crazy zealot smote my father across the face a favour which he returned by a thrust from his broadsword which sent his adversary to test in person the truth of his beliefs in most armies it would have been conceded that my father was within his rights in punishing promptly so rank an act of mutiny but the soldiers of cromwell had so high a notion of their own importance and privileges that they resented this summary justice upon their companion a court martial sat upon my father and it is likely that he would have been offered up as a sacrifice to appease the angry soldiery had not the lord protector interfered and limited the punishment to dismissal from the army cornet clarke was accordingly stripped of his buff coat and steel cap and wandered down to havant where he settled into business as a leather merchant and tanner thereby depriving parliament of as trusty a soldier as ever drew blade in its service finding that he prospered in trade he took as wife mary shepstone a young churchwoman and i micah clarke was the first pledge of their union my father as i remember him first was tall and straight with a great spread of shoulder and a mighty chest his face was craggy and stern with large harsh features shaggy over hanging brows high bridged fleshy nose and a full lipped mouth which tightened and set when he was angry his grey eyes were piercing and soldier like yet i have seen them lighten up into a kindly and merry twinkle his voice was the most tremendous and awe inspiring that i have ever listened to i can well believe what i have heard that when he chanted the hundredth psalm as he rode down among the blue bonnets at dunbar the sound of him rose above the blare of trumpets and the crash of guns like the deep roll of a breaking wave yet though he possessed every quality which was needed to raise him to distinction as an officer he had thrown off his military habits when he returned to civil life as he prospered and grew rich he might well have worn a sword but instead he would ever bear a small copy of the scriptures bound to his girdle where other men hung their weapons he was sober and measured in his speech and it was seldom even in the bosom of his own family that he would speak of the scenes which he had taken part in or of the great men fleetwood and harrison blake and ireton desborough and lambert some of whom had been simple troopers like himself when the troubles broke out he was frugal in his eating backward in drinking and allowed himself no pleasures save three pipes a day of oronooko tobacco which he kept ever in a brown jar by the great wooden chair on the left hand side of the mantelshelf yet for all his self restraint the old leaven would at times begin to work in him and bring on fits of what his enemies would call fanaticism and his friends piety though it must be confessed that this piety was prone to take a fierce and fiery shape as i look back one or two instances of that stand out so hard and clear in my recollection that they might be scenes which i had seen of late in the playhouse instead of memories of my childhood more than threescore years ago when the second charles was on the throne the first of these occurred when i was so young that i can remember neither what went before nor what immediately after it it stuck in my infant mind when other things slipped through it we were all in the house one sultry summer evening when there came a rattle of kettledrums and a clatter of hoofs which brought my mother and my father to the door she with me in her arms that i might have the better view it was a regiment of horse on their way from chichester to portsmouth with colours flying and band playing making the bravest show that ever my youthful eyes had rested upon with what wonder and admiration did i gaze at the sleek prancing steeds the steel morions the plumed hats of the officers the scarfs and bandoliers never i thought had such a gallant company assembled and i clapped my hands and cried out in my delight my father smiled gravely and took me from my mother s arms nay lad he said thou art a soldier s son and should have more judgment than to commend such a rabble as this canst thou not child as thou art see that their arms are ill found their stirrup irons rusted and their ranks without order or cohesion neither have they thrown out a troop in advance as should even in times of peace be done and their rear is straggling from here to bedhampton yea he continued suddenly shaking his long arm at the troopers and calling out to them ye are corn ripe for the sickle and waiting only for the reapers several of them reined up at this sudden out flame hit the crop eared rascal over the pate jack cried one to another wheeling his horse round but there was that in my father s face which caused him to fall back into the ranks again with his purpose unfulfilled the regiment jingled on down the road and my mother laid her thin hands upon my father s arm and lulled with her pretty coaxing ways the sleeping devil which had stirred within him on another occasion which i can remember about my seventh or eighth year his wrath burst out with more dangerous effect i was playing about him as he worked in the tanning yard one spring afternoon when in through the open doorway strutted two stately gentlemen with gold facings to their coats and smart cockades at the side of their three cornered hats they were as i afterwards understood officers of the fleet who were passing through havant and seeing us at work in the yard designed to ask us some question as to their route the younger of the pair accosted

him he was a thorn in the side of mr purfleet the usher who was generally in charge of the playground who had learned by long experience that whenever bob repton was quiet he was certain to be planning some special piece of mischief the usher was sitting now on a bench with a book in his hand but his attention was at present directed to a group of four boys who had drawn together in a corner of the playground there is repton again he said to himself i wonder what he is plotting now that boy will be the death of me i am quite sure it was he who put that eel in my bed last week though of course i could not prove it mr purfleet prided himself on his nerve he had been telling the boys some stories he had read of snakes in india among them one of an officer who when seated at table had felt a snake winding itself round his leg and who sat for several minutes without moving until some friends brought a saucer of milk and placed it near when the snake uncurled itself and went to drink it must have required a lot of nerve mr purfleet bob repton had said to sit as quiet as that not at all not at all the usher replied confidently it was the natural thing to do a man should always be calm in case of sudden danger bob the first thought in his mind should be what is this the second what had best be done under the circumstances and these two things being decided a man of courage will deal coolly with the danger i should despise myself if i were to act otherwise it was two nights later that the usher having walked down between the two rows of beds in the dormitory and seeing that all the boys were quiet and apparently asleep proceeded to his own bed which was at the end of the room and partly screened off from the rest by a curtain no sooner did he disappear behind this than half a dozen heads were raised an oil lamp burned at the end of the room affording light for the usher to undress and enabling him as he lay in bed to command a general if somewhat faint view of the dormitory five minutes after mr purfleet had disappeared behind the curtain the watching eyes saw the clothes at the end of the bed pulled down and caught a partial view of mr purfleet as he climbed in a second later there was a yell of terror and the usher leapt from the bed instantly the dormitory was in an uproar what is it mr purfleet what is the matter sir and several of the boys sprang from their beds and ran towards him the only exceptions to the general excitement being the four or five who were in the secret these lay shaking with suppressed laughter with the bedclothes or the corner of a pillow thrust into their mouths to prevent them from breaking out into screams of delight what is it sir it was some time before the usher could recover himself sufficiently to explain there is a snake in my bed he said a snake the boys repeated in astonishment several of the more timid at once making off to their beds certainly a snake mr purfleet panted i put my legs down and they came against something cold and it began to twist about in a moment if i had not leapt out i should no doubt have received a fatal wound where did it come from what is to be done and a variety of other questions burst from the boys i will run down and get three or four hockey sticks mr purfleet one of the elder boys said that will be the best plan mason quick quick there do you see it moving under the clothes there was certainly something wriggling so there was a general movement back from the bed we had better hold the clothes down mr purfleet bob repton said pushing himself forward if it were to crawl out at the top and get on to the floor it might bite a dozen of us i will hold the clothes down tight on one side if someone will hold them on the other one of the other boys came forward and the clothes were stretched tightly across the bed by the pillow in a minute or two mason ran up with four hockey sticks now you must be careful mr purfleet said because if it should get out the consequences might be terrible now then four of you take the sticks and all hit together as hard as you can now the sticks descended together there was a violent writhing and contortion beneath the clothes but the blows rained down fast and in a very short time all movement ceased it must be dead now bob repton said i think we can look at it now sir well draw the clothes down very gently boys and be ready to strike again if you see the least movement the clothes were drawn down till the creature was visible it must be a cobra the usher said looking at it from a distance it is thick and short it must have escaped from somewhere be very careful all of you mason approached cautiously to get a nearer view and then exclaimed why sir it is an eel there was a moment s silence and then a perfect yell of laughter from the boys for a moment the usher was dumbfounded then he rallied you will all go to your beds at once he said i shall report the matter to mr tulloch in the morning the boys retired laughing to their beds but above the din the usher heard the words in a muffled voice a man should always be calm in sudden danger another voice equally disguised said yes he should first ask himself what is this then what had best be done under the circumstances a third voice then took it up it follows that a man of courage will deal coolly with the danger then there was a chorus of half a dozen voices i should despise myself if i were to act otherwise silence the usher shouted rushing down the line between the beds i will thrash the first boy

pamphlet as a contribution to criticism or critical theory defoe s comments upon specific writers are thoroughly conventional and commonplace as may be seen from a glance at his remarks about milton chaucer spenser shakespeare and others on p of more interest is his very high praise of dryden a man for learning and universal writing in poetry perhaps the greatest that england has produc d p l and his comment upon the critical detraction from which he suffered he compares pope interestingly enough with dryden remarking that pope a person tho inferior to mr dryden yet speaking impartially has few superiors in this age also is persecuted by envy and he has generous praise for that poet s translation of homer one may note that defoe avoids the shortcomings of the critics whom he condemns for judging according to party he distributes his praise indiscriminately between whig and tory writers in short his essay hardly does more than confirm the critical commonplaces of the time and attest to the catholicity of the author s taste of particular interest for students of defoe is the paragraph p l in which defoe defends the hack writers who must write for subsistence one should not expect their writings which are necessarily numerous to be as correct and finished as they might be after comparing their pens to prostitutes because of their venality he claims in a half ironic tone for both authors and booksellers the liberty of writing and printing for either or both sides without ignominy after all they must write and print to live such practice is certainly he observes no more unjust or disreputable than other ways of gaining wealth such as one finds in exchange alley this paragraph gains point when one remembers that defoe had served both whig and tory governments in as letters written to lord stanhope in that very year testify he was engaged in the perhaps dubious business of masquerading as a tory while actually in the service of the whig ministry to take the sting out of the more violent tory periodicals and he was much concerned with the danger of his ambiguous position in december of he had been identified as a writer for mist s weekly journal the leading tory paper and was subjected to growing attacks in the whig press one can hardly doubt that this paragraph is a thinly veiled defense of his own practice as a professional journalist it is no surprise to find the author of a vindication in discussing the qualifications of writers advocating the importance of genius and natural parts above mere learning he instances the author of the true born englishman and shakespeare the former characteriz d as a person of little learning but of prodigious natural parts and the latter having but a small share of literature the further example of the literary achievements of the fair sex who had of course no university education reminds one of defoe s championship elsewhere of women the business of a writer is to please and inform and the general implication is that genius is more necessary to this end than learning also characteristic of defoe is his emphasis upon the advantage to an author of conversation the aliment of genius the life of all airy performances p likewise his digression upon education pp f his charge that people of quality in england all too often neglect their children s education his remarks upon the advantages of travel and the need of training in the vernacular all will be familiar to readers of defoe a vindication of the press is chiefly important for the corroboration of our knowledge of daniel defoe it presents nothing that is new but it gives further evidence of his pride in authorship of his rationalization of his actions as a professional journalist and of his belief in the importance of a free press many of his characteristic ideas are repeated with his usual consistency in point of view although the critical comments in the essay are thoroughly conventional they offer evidence of contemporary literary judgments and reveal defoe as a well informed man of moderation and commonsense though certainly not as a profound critic in the catholicity of his tastes and interests defoe is far ahead of his puritan fellows and his essay may be taken as one indication of the growing interest of the middle classes for whom he wrote in the greater world of literature as professor trent remarks in his ms notes defoe rarely wrote a tract without introducing something worthy of attention and comment and the present pamphlet is no exception to the rule i should like to thank dr henry c

mine eyes here therefore courteous reader i present thee with the life and death of mr badman indeed yea i do trace him in his life from his childhood to his death that thou mayest as in a glass behold with thine own eyes the steps that take hold of hell and also discern while thou art reading of mr badmans death whether thou thy self art treading in his path thereto and let me entreat thee to forbear quirking and mocking for that i say mr badman is dead but rather gravely enquire concerning thy self by the word whether thou art one of his linage or no for mr badman has left many of his relations behind him yea the very world is overspread with his kindred true some of his relations as he are gone to their place and long home but thousands of thousands are left behind as brothers sisters cousens nephews besides innumerable of his friends and associates i may say and yet speak nothing but too much truth in so saying that there is scarce a fellowship a community or fraternity of men in the world but some of mr badmans relations are there yea rarely can we find a family or houshold in a town where he has not left behind him either brother nephew or friend the butt therefore that at this time i shoot at is wide and twill be as impossible for this book to go into several families and not to arrest some as for the kings messenger to rush into an house full of traitors and find none but honest men there i cannot but think that this shot will light upon many since our fields are so full of this game but how many it will kill to mr badmans course and make alive to the pilgrims progress that is not in me to determine this secret is with the lord our god only and he alone knows to whom he will bless it to so good and so blessed an end however i have put fire to the pan and doubt not but the report will quickly be heard i told you before that mr badman had left many of his friends and relations behind him but if i survive them as that s a great question to me i may also write of their lives however whether my life be longer or shorter this is my prayer at present that god will stir up witnesses against them that may either convert or confound them for wherever they live and roll in their wickedness they are the pest and plague of that countrey england shakes and totters already by reason of the burden that mr badman and his friends have wickedly laid upon it yea our earth reels and staggereth to and fro like a drunkard the transgression thereof is heavy upon it courteous reader i will treat thee now even at the door and threshold of this house but only with this intelligence that mr badman lies dead within be pleased therefore if thy leisure will serve thee to enter in and behold the state in which he is laid betwixt his death bed and the grave he is not buried as yet nor doth he stink as is designed he shall before he lies down in oblivion now as others have had their funerals solemnized according to their greatness and grandure in the world so likewise mr badman forasmuch as he deserveth not to go down to his grave with silence has his funeral state according to his deserts four things are usual at great mens funerals which we will take leave and i hope without offence to allude to in the funeral of mr badman first they are sometimes when dead presented to their friends by their compleatly wrought images as lively as by cunning mens hands they can be that the remembrance of them may be renewed to their survivors the remembrance of them and their deeds and this i have endeavoured to answer in my discourse of mr badman and therefore i have drawn him forth in his featours and actions from his childhood to his gray hairs here therefore thou hast him lively set forth as in cutts both as to the minority flower and seniority of his age together with those actions of his life that he was most capable of doing in and under those present circumstances of time place strength and the opportunities that did attend him in these secondly there is also usual at great mens funerals those badges and scutcheons of their honour that they have received from their ancestors or have been thought worthy of for the deeds and exploits they have done in their life and here mr badman has his but such as vary from all men of worth but so much the more agreeing with the merit of his doings they all have descended in state he only as an abominable branch his deserts are the deserts of sin and therefore the scutcheons of honour that he has are only that he died without honour and at his end became a fool thou shalt not be joyned with them in burial the seed of evil doers shall never be renowned the funeral pomp therefore of mr badman is to wear upon his hearse the badges of a dishonourable and wicked life since his bones are full of the sins of his youth which shall lye down as job sayes in the dust with him nor is it fit that any should be his attendants now at his death but such as with him conspired against their own souls in their life persons whose transgressions have made them infamous to all that have or shall know what they have done some notice therefore i have also here in this little discourse given the reader of them who were his confederates in his life and attendants at his death with a hint either of some high villany committed by them as also of those judgments that have overtaken and fallen upon them from the just and revenging hand of god all which are things either fully known by me as being eye and ear witness thereto or that i have received from such hands whose relation as to

words be for the pretender and this can be no otherwise understood than to have a design however remote and upon whatever views to bring him in to possess the throne of these kingdoms the matter then being laid down thus as sincerely and plainly as possible we come to the question point blank and think it our duty to say with the greatest sincerity that we do not believe the ministry are in any kind or with any prospect near or remote acting for or with a design or view to bring in the pretender having granted this we must however to prevent any breaking in by way of cavil on one hand or triumph on the other subjoin immediately that we do not in the least grant by this that the protestant succession is in no danger even from several of the measures now taken in the world it is far from any reflection upon the ministry to say that however they may act upon a right sincere principle for the protestant succession in all they do which as above we profess to believe yet that many of the tools they make use of are of another make and have no edge to cut any other way no thoughts to move them towards any other end no other centre which they can have any tendency to that the pretender s interest is the magnet which draws them by its secret influence to point to him as their pole that they have their aim at his establishment here and own it to be their aim and as they are not shy to profess it among themselves so their conduct in many things makes it sufficiently public this is not meant as any reflection upon the ministry for making use of such men the late ministry did the same and every ministry will and must employ men sometimes not as they always join with them in their politic principles but as either the men are found useful in their several employments or as the ministry may be under other circumstances which makes it necessary to them to employ them nor as the review well enough observed does it follow that because the ministry have employed or joined with jacobites in the public affairs that therefore they must have done it with a jacobite principle but let the ministry employ these men by what necessity or upon what occasion they will though it may not follow that the ministry are therefore for the pretender yet it does not also follow that there is no danger of the protestant succession from the employing those sort of people for what if the queen should die the ministry it is hoped are established in the interest of their queen and country and therefore it has been argued that supposing the ministry had the pretender in their eye yet that it is irrational to suggest that they can have any such view during the life of her present majesty nay even those professed jacobites who we spoke of just now cannot be so ungrateful to think of deposing the queen who has been so bountiful so kind so exceeding good to them as in several cases to suffer them to be brought into the management of her own affairs when by their character they might have been thought dangerous even to her person thus winning and engaging them by her bounty and the confidence that has been placed in them not to attempt anything to her prejudice without the most monstrous ingratitude without flying in the face of all that sense of honour and obligation which it is possible for men of common sense to entertain and it can hardly be thought that even papists themselves under the highest possessions of their religious zeal can conquer the native aversions they must have to such abominable ingratitude or to think of bringing in the pretender upon this protestant nation even while the queen shall be on the throne but though this may and some doubt that also tie up their hands during the queen s life yet they themselves give us but small reason to expect anything from them afterward and it will be hard to find anybody to vouch for them then these very jacobites papists and professed enemies to the revolution may be supposed upon these pretensions to be quiet and offer no violence to the present establishment while her majesty has the possession and while that life lasts to which they are so much indebted for her royal goodness and clemency but what would they do if the queen should die come we next to the french king we are told that not the french king only but even the whole french nation are wonderfully forward to acknowledge the obligation they are under to the justice and favour which they have received from her majesty in the putting an end to the war a war which lay heavy upon them and threatened the very name of the french nation with ruin and much more threatened the glory of the french court and of their great monarch with an entire overthrow a total eclipse a war which by their own confession it was impossible for them long to have supported the expenses of and which by the great superiority of the allies became dreadful to them and that every campaign more than the other a war which they were in such pain to see the end of that they tried all the powers and courts in christendom who were the least neutral to engage a mediation in order to a treaty and all in vain and a war which if her majesty had not inclined to put an end to must have ended perhaps to the disadvantage and confusion of both france and spain if not of all christendom the obligations the french are under for the bringing this war to so just and honourable a conclusion are not at all concealed nay the french themselves have not been backward to make them public the declarations made by the french king of his

newgate his family ruined and himself without hopes of deliverance till sir robert harley who approved of his principles and foresaw that during a factious age such a genius could be converted to many uses represented his unmerited sufferings to the queen and at length procured his release the treasurer lord godolphin also sent a considerable sum to his wife and family and to him money to pay his fine and the expense of his discharge gratitude and fidelity are inseparable from an honest man and it was this benevolent act that prompted de foe to support harley with his able and ingenious pen when anne lay lifeless and his benefactor in the vicissitude of party was persecuted by faction and overpowered though not conquered by violence the talents and perseverance of de foe began now to be properly estimated and as a firm supporter of the administration he was sent by lord godolphin to scotland on an errand which as he says was far from being unfit for a sovereign to direct or an honest man to perform his knowledge of commerce and revenue his powers of insinuation and above all his readiness of pen were deemed of no small utility in promoting the union of the two kingdoms of which he wrote an able history in with two dedications one to the queen and another to the duke of queensbury soon afterwards he unhappily by some equivocal writings rendered himself suspected by both parties so that he once more retired to newington in hopes of spending the remainder of his days in peace his pension being withdrawn and wearied with politics he began to compose works of a different kind the year may therefore be regarded as the period of de foe s political life faction henceforth found other advocates and parties procured other writers to disseminate their suggestions and to propagate their falsehoods in de foe published the family instructor a work inculcating the domestic duties in a lively manner by narration and dialogue and displaying much knowledge of life in the middle ranks of society religious courtship also appeared soon after which like the family instructor is eminently religious and moral in its tendency and strongly impresses on the mind that spirit of sobriety and private devotion for which the dissenters have generally been distinguished the most celebrated of all his works the life and adventures of robinson crusoe appeared in this work has

it now ceased to be so almost completely with the support which such methods secured along with encouragement from his ministers the king was prepared to put in operation his policy for regulating the affairs of america writs of assistance were followed by the passage of the stamp act the ostensible object of both these measures was to help pay the debt incurred by the french war but the real purpose lay deeper and was nothing more or less than the ultimate extension of parliamentary rule in great things as well as small to america at this crisis so momentous for the colonists the rockingham ministry was formed and burke together with pitt supported a motion for the unconditional repeal of the stamp act after much wrangling the motion was carried and the first blunder of the mother country seemed to have been smoothed over only a few months elapsed however when the question of taxing the colonies was revived pitt lay ill and could take no part in the proposed measure through the influence of other members of his party notably townshend a series of acts were passed imposing duties on several exports to america this was followed by a suspension of the new york assembly because it had disregarded instructions in the matter of supplies for the troops the colonists were furious matters went from bad to worse to withdraw as far as possible without yielding the principle at stake the duties on all the exports mentioned in the bill were removed except that on tea but it was precisely the principle for which the colonists were contending they were not in the humor for compromise when they believed their freedom was endangered and the strength and determination of their resistance found a climax in the boston tea party in the meantime lord north who was absolutely obedient to the king had become prime minister five bills were prepared the tenor of which it was thought would overawe the colonists of these the boston port bill and the regulating act are perhaps the most famous though the ultimate tendency of all was blindly coercive while the king and his friends were busy with these the opposition proposed an unconditional repeal of the tea act the bill was introduced only to be overwhelmingly defeated by the same parliament that passed the five measures of lord north in america the effect of these proceedings was such as might have been expected by thinking men the colonies were as a unit in their support of massachusetts the regulating act was set at defiance public officers in the king s service were forced to resign town meetings were held and preparations for war were begun in dead earnest to avert this some of england s greatest statesmen pitt among the number asked for a reconsideration on february the first a bill was introduced which would have gone far toward bringing peace one month later burke delivered his speech on conciliation with the colonies edmund burke there is nothing unusual in burke s early life he was born in dublin ireland in his father was a successful lawyer and a protestant his mother a catholic at the age of twelve he became a pupil of abraham shackleton a quaker who had been teaching some fifteen years at ballitore a small town thirty miles from dublin in after years burke was always pleased to speak of his old friend in the kindest way if i am anything he declares it is the education i had there that has made me so and again at shackleton s death when burke was near the zenith of his fame and popularity he writes i had a true honor and affection for that excellent man i feel something like a satisfaction in the midst of my concern that i was fortunate enough to have him under my roof before his departure it can hardly be doubted that the old quaker schoolmaster succeeded with his pupil who was already so favorably inclined and it is more than probable that the daily example of one who lived out his precepts was strong in its influence upon a young and generous mind burke attended school at ballitore two years then at the age of fourteen he became a student at trinity college dublin and remained there five years at college he was unsystematic and careless of routine he seems to have done pretty much as he pleased and however methodical he became in after life his study during these five years was rambling and spasmodic the only definite knowledge we have of this period is given by burke himself in letters to his former friend richard shackleton son of his old schoolmaster what he did was done with a zest that at times became a feverish impatience first i was greatly taken with natural philosophy which while i should have given my mind to logic employed me incessantly this i call my furor mathematicus following in succession come his furor logicus furor historicus and furor peoticus each of which absorbed him for the time being it would be wrong however to think of burke as a trifler even in his youth he read in the library three hours every day and we may be sure he read as intelligently as eagerly it is more than probable that like a few other great minds he did not need a rigid system to guide him if he chose his subjects of study at pleasure there is every reason to believe he mastered them of intimate friends at the university we hear nothing goldsmith came one year later but there is no evidence that they knew each other it is probable that burke always reserved had little in common with his young associates his own musings with occasional attempts at writing poetry long walks through the country and frequent letters to and from richard shackleton employed him when not at his books two years after taking his degree burke went to london and established himself at the middle temple for the u,1

should be obliged to blame the favourites of the people he will be considered as the tool of power if he censures those in power he will be looked on as an instrument of faction but in all exertions of duty something is to be hazarded in cases of tumult and disorder our law has invested every man in some sort with the authority of a magistrate when the affairs of the nation are distracted private people are by the spirit of that law justified in stepping a little out of their ordinary sphere they enjoy a privilege of somewhat more dignity and effect than that of idle lamentation over the calamities of their country they may look into them narrowly they may reason upon them liberally and if they should be so fortunate as to discover the true source of the mischief and to suggest any probable method of removing it though they may displease the rulers for the day they are certainly of service to the cause of government government is deeply interested in everything which even through the medium of some temporary uneasiness may tend finally to compose the minds of the subjects and to conciliate their affections i have nothing to do here with the abstract value of the voice of the people but as long as reputation the most precious possession of every individual and as long as opinion the great support of the state depend entirely upon that voice it can never be considered as a thing of little consequence either to individuals or to government nations are not primarily ruled by laws less by violence whatever original energy may be supposed either in force or regulation the operation of both is in truth merely instrumental nations are governed by the same methods and on the same principles by which an individual without authority is often able to govern those who are his equals or his superiors by a knowledge of their temper and by a judicious management of it i mean when public affairs are steadily and quietly conducted not when government is nothing but a continued scuffle between the magistrate and the multitude in which sometimes the one and sometimes the other is uppermost in which they alternately yield and prevail in a series of contemptible victories and scandalous submissions the temper of the people amongst whom he presides ought therefore to be the first study of a statesman and the knowledge of this temper it is by no means impossible for him to attain if he has not an interest in being ignorant of what it is his duty to learn to complain of the age we live in to murmur at the present possessors of power to lament the past to conceive extravagant hopes of the future are the common dispositions of the greater part of mankind indeed the necessary effects of the ignorance and levity of the vulgar such complaints and humours have existed in all times yet as all times have not been alike true political sagacity manifests itself in distinguishing that complaint which only characterises the general infirmity of human nature from those which are symptoms of the particular distemperature of our own air and season nobody i believe will consider it merely as the language of spleen or disappointment if i say that there is something particularly alarming in the present conjuncture there is hardly a man in or out of power who holds any other language that government is at once dreaded and contemned that the laws are despoiled of all their respected and salutary terrors that their inaction is a subject of ridicule and their exertion of abhorrence that rank and office and title and all the solemn plausibilities of the world have lost their reverence and effect that our foreign politics are as much deranged as our domestic economy that our dependencies are slackened in their affection and loosened from their obedience that we know neither how to yield nor how to enforce that hardly anything above or below abroad or at home is sound and entire but that disconnection and confusion in offices in parties in families in parliament in the nation prevail beyond the disorders of any former time these are facts universally admitted and lamented this state of things is the more extraordinary because the great parties which formerly divided and agitated the kingdom are known to be in a manner entirely dissolved no great external calamity has visited the nation no pestilence or famine we do not labour at present under any scheme of taxation new or oppressive in the quantity or in the mode nor are we engaged in unsuccessful war in which our misfortunes might easily pervert our judgment and our minds sore from the loss of national glory might feel every blow of fortune as a crime in government it is impossible that the cause of this strange distemper should not sometimes become a subject of discourse it is a compliment due and which i willingly pay to those who administer our affairs to take notice in the first place of their speculation our ministers are of opinion that the increase of our trade and manufactures that our growth by colonisation and by conquest have concurred to accumulate immense wealth in the hands of some individuals and this again being dispersed amongst the people has rendered them universally proud ferocious and ungovernable that the insolence of some from their enormous wealth and the boldness of others from a guilty poverty have rendered them capable of the most atrocious attempts so that they have trampled upon all subordination and violently borne down the unarmed laws of a free government barriers too feeble against the fury of a populace so

chap iv of the two contemporary empires of the p babylonians and medes chap v a description of the temple of solomon p chap vi of the empire of the persians p advertisement tho the chronology of ancient kingdoms amended was writ by the author many years since yet he lately revis d it and was actually preparing it for the press at the time of his death but the short chronicle was never intended to be made public and therefore was not so lately corrected by him to this the reader must impute it if he shall find any places where the short chronicle does not accurately agree with the dates assigned in the larger piece the sixth chapter was not copied out with the other five which makes it doubtful whether he intended to print it but being found among his papers and evidently appearing to be a continuation of the same work and as such abridg d in the short chronicle it was thought proper to be added had the great author himself liv d to publish this work there would have been no occasion for this advertisement but as it is the reader is desired to allow for such imperfections as are inseparable from posthumous pieces and in so great a number of proper names to excuse some errors of the press that have escaped a short chronicle from the first memory of things in europe to the conquest of persia by alexander the great the introduction the greek antiquities are full of poetical fictions because the greeks wrote nothing in prose before the conquest of asia by cyrus the persian then pherecydes scyrius and cadmus milesius introduced the writing in prose pherecydes atheniensis about the end of the reign of darius hystaspis wrote of antiquities and digested his work by genealogies and was reckoned one of the best genealogers epimenides the historian proceeded also by genealogies and hellanicus who was twelve years older than herodotus digested his history by the ages or successions of the priestesses of juno argiva others digested theirs by the kings of the laced monians or archons of athens hippias the elean about thirty years before the fall of the persian empire published a breviary or list of the olympic victors and about ten years before the fall thereof ephorus the disciple of isocrates formed a chronological history of greece beginning with the return of the heraclides into peloponnesus and ending with the siege of perinthus in the twentieth year of philip the father of alexander the great but he digested things by generations and the reckoning by olympiads was not yet in use nor doth it appear that the reigns of kings were yet set down by numbers of years the arundelian marbles were composed sixty years after the death of alexander the great an olymp and yet mention not the olympiads but in the next olympiad tim us siculus published an history in several books down to his own times according to the olympiads comparing the ephori the kings of sparta the archons of athens and the priestesses of argos with the olympic victors so as to make the olympiads and the genealogies and successions of kings archons and priestesses and poetical histories suit with one another according to the best of his judgment and where he left off polybius began and carried on the history so then a little after the death of alexander the great they began to set down the generations reigns and successions in numbers of years and by putting reigns and successions equipollent to generations and three generations to an hundred or an hundred and twenty years as appears by their chronology they have made the antiquities of greece three or four hundred years older than the truth and this was the original of the technical chronology of the greeks eratosthenes wrote about an hundred years after the death of alexander the great he was followed by apollodorus and these two have been followed ever since by chronologers but how uncertain their chronology is and how doubtful it was reputed by the greeks of those times may be understood by these passages of plutarch some reckon saith he lycurgus contemporary to iphitus and to have been h,1

of quality to his friend clearly there was need to answer this pamphlet and to state more fully the case against the whigs this task was undertaken by two of the greatest writers of english prose george savile then earl later marquis of halifax and john dryden halifax in the tract lately identified as his by hugh macdonald cambridge observations upon a late libel though he might scarify an individual opponent like shaftesbury or pour ridicule upon a sentence from a letter set himself the task of answering the whig case as a whole the text he dilated upon was there seemeth to be no other rule allowed by one sort of men than that they cannot err and the king cannot be in the right with superb irony and wit he demonstrated how inconsistent such an attitude was with the constitution of that day dryden s tract his majesties declaration defended is like the one he is answering in the form of a letter to a friend who has asked the writer s opinion of the declaration and the answer to it i shall obey you the more willingly dryden responds because i know you are a lover of the peace and quietness of your country which the author of this seditious pamphlet is endeavouring to disturb he writes to show the goodness and equity of the prince because once they are understood the faction will lose its power and the well meaning but misled crowd will be no longer deceived by the specious names of religion and liberty after these introductory paragraphs dryden began to reply to the pamphlet point by point his method is to quote or more strictly partly to quote and partly to paraphrase a sentence and then refute its argument in so doing he is following the method of the author of a letter accordingly to understand and judge the fairness of dryden s refutation it is well first to read his majesties declaration then a letter and finally dryden the first has not been reprinted in full but a substantial extract may be found in echard s history of england iii and in arthur bryant s the letters of charles ii pp the second is available in a not uncommon folio state tracts being a collection of several treatises privately printed in the reign of k charles ii and the third is here reproduced for the first time after the perusal of these three tracts the student may well turn to absalom and achitophel and find instruction in comparing the prose and the verse he may reach the conclusion that while both were written to win converts to the royal cause the first was designed to weaken the whig party and the second to take advantage of a tide that had turned to ruin the whig leaders for a fuller discussion of the relationship of dryden s tract and his poem see the writer s article the conclusion of dryden s absalom and achitophel in the huntington library

opinion of the kings declaration and the answer to it which you write me word was sent you lately i shall obey you the more willingly because i know you are a lover of the peace and quietness of your country which the author of this seditious pamphlet is endeavouring to disturb be pleas d to understand then that before the declaration was yet published and while it was only the common news that such an one there was intended to justifie the dissolution of the two last parliaments it was generally agreed by the heads of the discontented party that this declaration must be answer d and that with all the ingredients of malice which the ablest amongst them could squeeze into it accordingly upon the first appearance of it in print five several pens of their cabal were set to work and the product of each having been examin d a certain person of quality appears to have carried the majority of votes and to be chosen like a new matthias to succeed in the place of their deceas d judas he seems to be a man cut out to carry on vigorously the designs of the phanatique party which are manifestly in this paper to hinder the king from making any good impression on his subjects by giving them all possible satisfaction and the reason of this undertaking is manifest for if once the goodness and equity of the prince comes to be truly understood by the people the authority of the faction is extinguish d and the well meaning crowd who are misled will no longer gape after the specious names of religion and liberty much like the folly of the jews expecting a messiah still to come whose

mine eyes here therefore courteous reader i present thee with the life and death of mr badman indeed yea i do trace him in his life from his childhood to his death that thou mayest as in a glass behold with thine own eyes the steps that take hold of hell and also discern while thou art reading of mr badmans death whether thou thy self art treading in his path thereto and let me entreat thee to forbear quirking and mocking for that i say mr badman is dead but rather gravely enquire concerning thy self by the word whether thou art one of his linage or no for mr badman has left many of his relations behind him yea the very world is overspread with his kindred true some of his relations as he are gone to their place and long home but thousands of thousands are left behind as brothers sisters cousens nephews besides innumerable of his friends and associates i may say and yet speak nothing but too much truth in so saying that there is scarce a fellowship a community or fraternity of men in the world but some of mr badmans relations are there yea rarely can we find a family or houshold in a town where he has not left behind him either brother nephew or friend the butt therefore that at this time i shoot at is wide and twill be as impossible for this book to go into several families and not to arrest some as for the kings messenger to rush into an house full of traitors and find none but honest men there i cannot but think that this shot will light upon many since our fields are so full of this game but how many it will kill to mr badmans course and make alive to the pilgrims progress that is not in me to determine this secret is with the lord our god only and he alone knows to whom he will bless it to so good and so blessed an end however i have put fire to the pan and doubt not but the report will quickly be heard i told you before that mr badman had left many of his friends and relations behind him but if i survive them as that s a great question to me i may also write of their lives however whether my life be longer or shorter this is my prayer at present that god will stir up witnesses against them that may either convert or confound them for wherever they live and roll in their wickedness they are the pest and plague of that countrey england shakes and totters already by reason of the burden that mr badman and his friends have wickedly laid upon it yea our earth reels and staggereth to and fro like a drunkard the transgression thereof is heavy upon it courteous reader i will treat thee now even at the door and threshold of this house but only with this intelligence that mr badman lies dead within be pleased therefore if thy leisure will serve thee to enter in and behold the state in which he is laid betwixt his death bed and the grave he is not buried as yet nor doth he stink as is designed he shall before he lies down in oblivion now as others have had their funerals solemnized according to their greatness and grandure in the world so likewise mr badman forasmuch as he deserveth not to go down to his grave with silence has his funeral state according to his deserts four things are usual at great mens funerals which we will take leave and i hope without offence to allude to in the funeral of mr badman first they are sometimes when dead presented to their friends by their compleatly wrought images as lively as by cunning mens hands they can be that the remembrance of them may be renewed to their survivors the remembrance of them and their deeds and this i have endeavoured to answer in my discourse of mr badman and therefore i have drawn him forth in his featours and actions from his childhood to his gray hairs here therefore thou hast him lively set forth as in cutts both as to the minority flower and seniority of his age together with those actions of his life that he was most capable of doing in and under those present circumstances of time place strength and the opportunities that did attend him in these secondly there is also usual at great mens funerals those badges and scutcheons of their honour that they have received from their ancestors or have been thought worthy of for the deeds and exploits they have done in their life and here mr badman has his but such as vary from all men of worth but so much the more agreeing with the merit of his doings they all have descended in state he only as an abominable branch his deserts are the deserts of sin and therefore the scutcheons of honour that he has are only that he died without honour and at his end became a fool thou shalt not be joyned with them in burial the seed of evil doers shall never be renowned the funeral pomp therefore of mr badman is to wear upon his hearse the badges of a dishonourable and wicked life since his bones are full of the sins of his youth which shall lye down as job sayes in the dust with him nor is it fit that any should be his attendants now at his death but such as with him conspired against their own souls in their life persons whose transgressions have made them infamous to all that have or shall know what they have done some notice therefore i have also here in this little discourse given the reader of them who were his confederates in his life and attendants at his death with a hint either of some high villany committed by them as also of those judgments that have overtaken and fallen upon them from the just and revenging hand of god all which are things either fully known by me as being eye and ear witness thereto or that i have received from such hands whose relation as to this i am bound to believe and that the reader may know them from other things and passages herein contained i have pointed at them in the margent,1

rare military endowments disgracefully routed by a handful of french and indians and only saved from annihilation by the coolness and spirit of a virginian boy whose riper fame has since diffused itself with the steady influence of moral truth to the uttermost confines of christendom a wide frontier had been laid naked by this unexpected disaster and more substantial evils were preceded by a thousand fanciful and imaginary dangers the alarmed colonists believed that the yells of the savages mingled with every fitful gust of wind that issued from the interminable forests of the west the terrific character of their merciless enemies increased immeasurably the natural horrors of warfare numberless recent massacres were still vivid in their recollections nor was there any ear in the provinces so deaf as not to have drunk in with avidity the narrative of some fearful tale of midnight murder in which the natives of the forests were the principal and barbarous actors as the credulous and excited traveller related the hazardous chances of the wilderness the blood of the timid curdled with terror and mothers cast anxious glances even at those children which slumbered within the security of the largest towns in short the magnifying influence of fear began to set at naught the calculations of reason and to render those who should have remembered their manhood the slaves of the basest of passions even the most confident and the stoutest hearts began to think the issue of the contest was becoming doubtful and that abject class was hourly increasing in numbers who thought they foresaw all the possessions of the english crown in america subdued by their christian foes or laid waste by the inroads of their relentless allies when therefore intelligence was received at the fort which covered the southern termination of the portage between the hudson and the lakes that montcalm had been seen moving up the champlain with an army numerous as the leaves on the trees its truth was admitted with more of the craven reluctance of fear than with the stern joy that a warrior should feel in finding an enemy within reach of his blow the news had been brought towards the decline of a day in midsummer by an indian runner who also bore an urgent request from munro the commander of a work on the shore of the holy lake for a speedy and powerful reinforcement it has already been mentioned that the distance between these two posts was less than five leagues the rude path which originally formed their line of communication had been widened for the passage of wagons so that the distance which had been travelled by the son of the forest in two hours might easily be effected by a detachment of troops with their necessary baggage between the rising and setting of a summer sun the loyal servants of the british crown had given to one of these forest fastnesses the name of william henry and to the other that of fort edward calling each after a favorite prince of the reigning family the veteran scotchman just named held the first with a regiment of regulars and a few provincials a force really by far too small to make head against the formidable power that montcalm was leading to the foot of his earthen mounds at the latter however lay general webb who commanded the armies of the king in the northern provinces with a body of more than five thousand men by uniting the several detachments of his command this officer might have arrayed nearly double that number of combatants against the enterprising frenchman who had ventured so far from his reinforcements with an army but little superior in numbers but under the influence of their degraded fortunes both officers and men appeared better disposed to await the approach of their formidable antagonists within their works than to resist the progress of their march by emulating the successful example of the french at fort du quesne and striking a blow on their advance after the first surprise of the intelligence had a little abated a rumor was spread through the entrenched camp which stretched along the margin of the hudson forming a chain of outworks to the body of the fort itself that a chosen detachment of fifteen hundred men was to depart with the dawn for william henry the post at the northern extremity of the portage that which at first was only rumor soon became certainty as orders passed from the quarters of the commander in chief to the several corps he had selected for this service to prepare for their speedy departure all doubt as to the intention of webb

words be for the pretender and this can be no otherwise understood than to have a design however remote and upon whatever views to bring him in to possess the throne of these kingdoms the matter then being laid down thus as sincerely and plainly as possible we come to the question point blank and think it our duty to say with the greatest sincerity that we do not believe the ministry are in any kind or with any prospect near or remote acting for or with a design or view to bring in the pretender having granted this we must however to prevent any breaking in by way of cavil on one hand or triumph on the other subjoin immediately that we do not in the least grant by this that the protestant succession is in no danger even from several of the measures now taken in the world it is far from any reflection upon the ministry to say that however they may act upon a right sincere principle for the protestant succession in all they do which as above we profess to believe yet that many of the tools they make use of are of another make and have no edge to cut any other way no thoughts to move them towards any other end no other centre which they can have any tendency to that the pretender s interest is the magnet which draws them by its secret influence to point to him as their pole that they have their aim at his establishment here and own it to be their aim and as they are not shy to profess it among themselves so their conduct in many things makes it sufficiently public this is not meant as any reflection upon the ministry for making use of such men the late ministry did the same and every ministry will and must employ men sometimes not as they always join with them in their politic principles but as either the men are found useful in their several employments or as the ministry may be under other circumstances which makes it necessary to them to employ them nor as the review well enough observed does it follow that because the ministry have employed or joined with jacobites in the public affairs that therefore they must have done it with a jacobite principle but let the ministry employ these men by what necessity or upon what occasion they will though it may not follow that the ministry are therefore for the pretender yet it does not also follow that there is no danger of the protestant succession from the employing those sort of people for what if the queen should die the ministry it is hoped are established in the interest of their queen and country and therefore it has been argued that supposing the ministry had the pretender in their eye yet that it is irrational to suggest that they can have any such view during the life of her present majesty nay even those professed jacobites who we spoke of just now cannot be so ungrateful to think of deposing the queen who has been so bountiful so kind so exceeding good to them as in several cases to suffer them to be brought into the management of her own affairs when by their character they might have been thought dangerous even to her person thus winning and engaging them by her bounty and the confidence that has been placed in them not to attempt anything to her prejudice without the most monstrous ingratitude without flying in the face of all that sense of honour and obligation which it is possible for men of common sense to entertain and it can hardly be thought that even papists themselves under the highest possessions of their religious zeal can conquer the native aversions they must have to such abominable ingratitude or to think of bringing in the pretender upon this protestant nation even while the queen shall be on the throne but though this may and some doubt that also tie up their hands during the queen s life yet they themselves give us but small reason to expect anything from them afterward and it will be hard to find anybody to vouch for them then these very jacobites papists and professed enemies to the revolution may be supposed upon these pretensions to be quiet and offer no violence to the present establishment while her majesty has the possession and while that life lasts to which they are so much indebted for her royal goodness and clemency but what would they do if the queen should die come we next to the french king we are told that not the french king only but even the whole french nation are wonderfully forward to acknowledge the obligation they are under to the justice and favour which they have received from her majesty in the putting an end to the war a war which lay heavy upon them and threatened the very name of the french nation with ruin and much more threatened the glory of the french court and of their great monarch with an entire overthrow a total eclipse a war which by their own confession it was impossible for them long to have supported the expenses of and which by the great superiority of the allies became dreadful to them and that every campaign more than the other a war which they were in such pain to see the end of that they tried all the powers and courts in christendom who were the least neutral to engage a mediation in order to a treaty and all in vain and a war which if her majesty had not inclined to put an end to must have ended perhaps to the disadvantage and confusion of both france and spain if not of all christendom the obligations the french are under for the bringing this war to so just and honourable a conclusion are not at all concealed nay the french themselves have not been backward to make them public the declarations made by the french king of his

time later fallen into an argument with one of his troopers concerning the mystery of the trinity the man who was a half crazy zealot smote my father across the face a favour which he returned by a thrust from his broadsword which sent his adversary to test in person the truth of his beliefs in most armies it would have been conceded that my father was within his rights in punishing promptly so rank an act of mutiny but the soldiers of cromwell had so high a notion of their own importance and privileges that they resented this summary justice upon their companion a court martial sat upon my father and it is likely that he would have been offered up as a sacrifice to appease the angry soldiery had not the lord protector interfered and limited the punishment to dismissal from the army cornet clarke was accordingly stripped of his buff coat and steel cap and wandered down to havant where he settled into business as a leather merchant and tanner thereby depriving parliament of as trusty a soldier as ever drew blade in its service finding that he prospered in trade he took as wife mary shepstone a young churchwoman and i micah clarke was the first pledge of their union my father as i remember him first was tall and straight with a great spread of shoulder and a mighty chest his face was craggy and stern with large harsh features shaggy over hanging brows high bridged fleshy nose and a full lipped mouth which tightened and set when he was angry his grey eyes were piercing and soldier like yet i have seen them lighten up into a kindly and merry twinkle his voice was the most tremendous and awe inspiring that i have ever listened to i can well believe what i have heard that when he chanted the hundredth psalm as he rode down among the blue bonnets at dunbar the sound of him rose above the blare of trumpets and the crash of guns like the deep roll of a breaking wave yet though he possessed every quality which was needed to raise him to distinction as an officer he had thrown off his military habits when he returned to civil life as he prospered and grew rich he might well have worn a sword but instead he would ever bear a small copy of the scriptures bound to his girdle where other men hung their weapons he was sober and measured in his speech and it was seldom even in the bosom of his own family that he would speak of the scenes which he had taken part in or of the great men fleetwood and harrison blake and ireton desborough and lambert some of whom had been simple troopers like himself when the troubles broke out he was frugal in his eating backward in drinking and allowed himself no pleasures save three pipes a day of oronooko tobacco which he kept ever in a brown jar by the great wooden chair on the left hand side of the mantelshelf yet for all his self restraint the old leaven would at times begin to work in him and bring on fits of what his enemies would call fanaticism and his friends piety though it must be confessed that this piety was prone to take a fierce and fiery shape as i look back one or two instances of that stand out so hard and clear in my recollection that they might be scenes which i had seen of late in the playhouse instead of memories of my childhood more than threescore years ago when the second charles was on the throne the first of these occurred when i was so young that i can remember neither what went before nor what immediately after it it stuck in my infant mind when other things slipped through it we were all in the house one sultry summer evening when there came a rattle of kettledrums and a clatter of hoofs which brought my mother and my father to the door she with me in her arms that i might have the better view it was a regiment of horse on their way from chichester to portsmouth with colours flying and band playing making the bravest show that ever my youthful eyes had rested upon with what wonder and admiration did i gaze at the sleek prancing steeds the steel morions the plumed hats of the officers the scarfs and bandoliers never i thought had such a gallant company assembled and i clapped my hands and cried out in my delight my father smiled gravely and took me from my mother s arms nay lad he said thou art a soldier s son and should have more judgment than to commend such a rabble as this canst thou not child as thou art see that their arms are ill found their stirrup irons rusted and their ranks without order or cohesion neither have they thrown out a troop in advance as should even in times of peace be done and their rear is straggling from here to bedhampton yea he continued suddenly shaking his long arm at the troopers and calling out to them ye are corn ripe for the sickle and waiting only for the reapers several of them reined up at this sudden out flame hit the crop eared rascal over the pate jack cried one to another wheeling his horse round but there was that in my father s face which caused him to fall back into the ranks again with his purpose unfulfilled the regiment jingled on down the road and my mother laid her thin hands upon my father s arm and lulled with her pretty coaxing ways the sleeping devil which had stirred within him on another occasion which i can remember about my seventh or eighth year his wrath burst out with more dangerous effect i was playing about him as he worked in the tanning yard one spring afternoon when in through the open doorway strutted two stately gentlemen with gold facings to their coats and smart cockades at the side of their three cornered hats they were

mine eyes here therefore courteous reader i present thee with the life and death of mr badman indeed yea i do trace him in his life from his childhood to his death that thou mayest as in a glass behold with thine own eyes the steps that take hold of hell and also discern while thou art reading of mr badmans death whether thou thy self art treading in his path thereto and let me entreat thee to forbear quirking and mocking for that i say mr badman is dead but rather gravely enquire concerning thy self by the word whether thou art one of his linage or no for mr badman has left many of his relations behind him yea the very world is overspread with his kindred true some of his relations as he are gone to their place and long home but thousands of thousands are left behind as brothers sisters cousens nephews besides innumerable of his friends and associates i may say and yet speak nothing but too much truth in so saying that there is scarce a fellowship a community or fraternity of men in the world but some of mr badmans relations are there yea rarely can we find a family or houshold in a town where he has not left behind him either brother nephew or friend the butt therefore that at this time i shoot at is wide and twill be as impossible for this book to go into several families and not to arrest some as for the kings messenger to rush into an house full of traitors and find none but honest men there i cannot but think that this shot will light upon many since our fields are so full of this game but how many it will kill to mr badmans course and make alive to the pilgrims progress that is not in me to determine this secret is with the lord our god only and he alone knows to whom he will bless it to so good and so blessed an end however i have put fire to the pan and doubt not but the report will quickly be heard i told you before that mr badman had left many of his friends and relations behind him but if i survive them as that s a great question to me i may also write of their lives however whether my life be longer or shorter this is my prayer at present that god will stir up witnesses against them that may either convert or confound them for wherever they live and roll in their wickedness they are the pest and plague of that countrey england shakes and totters already by reason of the burden that mr badman and his friends have wickedly laid upon it yea our earth reels and staggereth to and fro like a drunkard the transgression thereof is heavy upon it courteous reader i will treat thee now even at the door and threshold of this house but only with this intelligence that mr badman lies dead within be pleased therefore if thy leisure will serve thee to enter in and behold the state in which he is laid betwixt his death bed and the grave he is not buried as yet nor doth he stink as is designed he shall before he lies down in oblivion now as others have had their funerals solemnized according to their greatness and grandure in the world so likewise mr badman forasmuch as he deserveth not to go down to his grave with silence has his funeral state according to his deserts four things are usual at great mens funerals which we will take leave and i hope without offence to allude to in the funeral of mr badman first they are sometimes when dead presented to their friends by their compleatly wrought images as lively as by cunning mens hands they can be that the remembrance of them may be renewed to their survivors the remembrance of them and their deeds and this i have endeavoured to answer in my discourse of mr badman and therefore i have drawn him forth in his featours and actions from his childhood to his gray hairs here therefore thou hast him lively set forth as in cutts both as to the minority flower and seniority of his age together with those actions of his life that he was most capable of doing in and under those present circumstances of time place strength and the opportunities that did attend him in these secondly there is also usual at great mens funerals those badges and scutcheons of their honour that they have received from their ancestors or have been thought worthy of for the deeds and exploits they have done in their life and here mr badman has his but such as vary from all men of worth but so much the more agreeing with the merit of his doings they all have descended in state he only as an abominable branch his deserts are the deserts of sin and therefore the scutcheons of honour that he has are only that he died without honour and at his end became a fool thou shalt not be joyned with them in burial the seed of evil doers shall never be renowned the funeral pomp therefore of mr badman is to wear upon his hearse the badges of a dishonourable and wicked life since his bones are full of the sins of his youth which shall lye down as job sayes in the dust with him nor is it fit that any should be his attendants now at his death but such as with him conspired against their own souls in their life persons whose transgressions have made them infamous to all that have or shall know what they have done some notice therefore i have also here in this little discourse given the reader of them who were his confederates in his life and attendants at his death with a hint either of some high villany committed by them as also of those judgments that have overtaken and fallen upon them from the just and revenging hand of god all which are things either fully known by me as being eye and ear witness thereto or that i have received from such hands whose relation as to

by which she was always known swift says her father was a younger brother of a good family in nottinghamshire her mother of a lower degree and indeed she had little to boast in her birth mrs johnson had two children esther and ann and lived at moor park as companion to lady giffard temple s widowed sister another member of the household afterwards to be esther s constant companion was rebecca

write has been charmingly brought before us in the painting exhibited by miss dicksee at the royal academy a few years ago he advised her what books to read and instructed her as he says in the principles of honour and virtue from which she never swerved in any one action or moment of her life by swift had grown tired of his position and finding that temple who valued his services was slow in finding him preferment he left moor park in order to carry out his resolve to go into the church he was ordained and obtained the prebend of kilroot near belfast where he carried on a flirtation with a miss waring whom he called varina but in may temple made proposals which induced swift to return to moor park where he was employed in preparing temple s memoirs and correspondence for publication and in supporting the side taken by temple in the letters of phalaris controversy by writing the battle of the books which was however not published until on his return to temple s house swift found his old playmate grown from a sickly child into a girl of fifteen in perfect health she came he says to be looked upon as one of the most beautiful graceful and agreeable young women in london only a little too fat her hair was blacker than a raven and every feature of her face in perfection on his death in january temple left a will dated directing the payment of pounds each with

temple left in swift s hands the task of publishing his posthumous works a duty which afterwards led to a quarrel with lady giffard and other members of the family many years later swift told lord palmerston that he stopped at moor park solely for the benefit of temple s conversation and advice and the opportunity of pursuing his studies at temple s death he was as far to seek as ever in the summer of however he was offered and accepted the post of secretary and chaplain to the earl of berkeley one of the lords justices but when he reached ireland he found that the secretaryship had been given to another he soon however obtained the living of laracor agher and rathbeggan and the prebend of dunlavin in st patrick s cathedral dublin the total value of these preferments was about pounds a year an income which miss waring seems to have thought enough to justify him in marrying swift s reply to the lady whom he had singled out at first from the rest of women could only have been written with the intention of breaking off the connection and accordingly we hear no more of poor varina at laracor a mile or two from trim and twenty miles from dublin swift ministered to a congregation of about fifteen persons and had abundant leisure for cultivating his garden making a canal after the dutch fashion of moor park planting willows and rebuilding the vicarage as chaplain to lord berkeley he spent much of his time in dublin he was on intimate terms with lady berkeley and her daughters one of whom is best known by her married name of lady betty germaine and through them he had access to the fashionable society of dublin when lord berkeley returned to england in april swift after taking his doctor s degree at dublin went with him and soon afterwards published anonymously a political pamphlet a discourse on the contests and dissentions in athens and rome when he returned to ireland in september he was accompanied by stella to give esther johnson the name by which she is best known and her friend mrs dingley stella s fortune was about pounds and the property temple had left her was in county wicklow swift very much for his own satisfaction who had few

whose silly speculations and absurd paradoxes are not worthy the attention of any reasonable man the advocate for the perfectibility of man and of society retorts on the defender of establishments a more than equal contempt he brands him as the slave of the most miserable and narrow prejudices or as the defender of the abuses of civil society only because he profits by them he paints him either as a character who prostitutes his understanding to his interest or as one whose powers of mind are not of a size to grasp any thing great and noble who cannot see above five yards before him and who must therefore be utterly unable to take in the views of the enlightened benefactor of mankind in this unamicable contest the cause of truth cannot but suffer the really good arguments on each side of the question are not allowed to have their proper weight each pursues his own theory little solicitous to correct or improve it by an attention to what is advanced by his opponents the friend of the present order of things condemns all political speculations in the gross he will not even condescend to examine the grounds from which the perfectibility of society is inferred much less will he give himself the trouble in a fair and candid manner to attempt an exposition of their fallacy the speculative philosopher equally offends against the cause of truth with eyes fixed on a happier state of society the blessings of which he paints in the most captivating colours he allows himself to indulge in the most bitter invectives against every present establishment without applying his talents to consider the best and safest means of removing abuses and without seeming to be aware of the tremendous obstacles that threaten even in theory to oppose the progress of man towards perfection it is an acknowledged truth in philosophy that a just theory will always be confirmed by experiment yet so much friction and so many minute circumstances occur in practice which it is next to impossible for the most enlarged and penetrating mind to foresee that on few subjects can any theory be pronounced just till all the arguments against it have been maturely weighed and clearly and consistently refuted i have read some of the speculations on the perfectibility of man and of society with great pleasure i have been warmed and delighted with the enchanting picture which they hold forth i ardently wish for such happy improvements but i see great and to my understanding unconquerable difficulties in the way to them these difficulties it is my present purpose to state declaring at the same time that so far from exulting in them as a cause of triumph over the friends of innovation nothing would give me greater pleasure than to see them completely removed the most important argument that i shall adduce is certainly not new the principles on which it depends have been explained in part by hume and more at large by dr adam smith it has been advanced and applied to the present subject though not with its proper weight or in the most forcible point of view by mr wallace and it may probably have been stated by many writers that i have never met with i should certainly therefore not think of advancing it again though i mean to place it in a point of view in some degree different from any that i have hitherto seen if it had ever been fairly and satisfactorily answered the cause of this neglect on the part of the advocates for the perfectibility of mankind is not easily accounted for i cannot doubt the talents of such men as godwin and condorcet i am unwilling to doubt their candour to my understanding and probably to that of most others the difficulty appears insurmountable yet these men of acknowledged ability and penetration scarcely deign to notice it and hold on their course in such speculations with unabated ardour and undiminished confidence i have certainly no right to say that they purposely shut their eyes to such arguments i ought rather to doubt the validity of them when neglected by such men however forcibly their truth may strike my own mind yet in this respect it must be acknowledged that we are all of us too prone to err if i saw a glass of wine repeatedly presented to a man and he took no notice of it i should be apt to think that he was blind or uncivil a juster philosophy might teach me rather to think that my eyes deceived me and that the offer was not really what i conceived it to be in entering upon the argument i must premise that i put out of the question at present all mere conjectures that is all suppositions the probable realization of which cannot be inferred upon any just philosophical grounds a writer may tell me that he thinks man will ultimately become an ostrich i cannot properly contradict him but before he can expect to bring any reasonable person over to his opinion he ought to shew that the necks of mankind have been gradually elongating that the lips have grown harder and more prominent that the legs and feet are daily altering their shape and that the hair is beginning to change into stubs of feathers and till the probability of so wonderful a conversion can be shewn it is surely lost time and lost eloquence to expatiate on the happiness of man in such a state to describe his powers both of running and flying to paint him in a condition where all narrow luxuries would be contemned where he would be employed only in collecting the necessaries of life and where consequently each man s share of labour would be light and his portion of leisure ample i think i may

words be for the pretender and this can be no otherwise understood than to have a design however remote and upon whatever views to bring him in to possess the throne of these kingdoms the matter then being laid down thus as sincerely and plainly as possible we come to the question point blank and think it our duty to say with the greatest sincerity that we do not believe the ministry are in any kind or with any prospect near or remote acting for or with a design or view to bring in the pretender having granted this we must however to prevent any breaking in by way of cavil on one hand or triumph on the other subjoin immediately that we do not in the least grant by this that the protestant succession is in no danger even from several of the measures now taken in the world it is far from any reflection upon the ministry to say that however they may act upon a right sincere principle for the protestant succession in all they do which as above we profess to believe yet that many of the tools they make use of are of another make and have no edge to cut any other way no thoughts to move them towards any other end no other centre which they can have any tendency to that the pretender s interest is the magnet which draws them by its secret influence to point to him as their pole that they have their aim at his establishment here and own it to be their aim and as they are not shy to profess it among themselves so their conduct in many things makes it sufficiently public this is not meant as any reflection upon the ministry for making use of such men the late ministry did the same and every ministry will and must employ men sometimes not as they always join with them in their politic principles but as either the men are found useful in their several employments or as the ministry may be under other circumstances which makes it necessary to them to employ them nor as the review well enough observed does it follow that because the ministry have employed or joined with jacobites in the public affairs that therefore they must have done it with a jacobite principle but let the ministry employ these men by what necessity or upon what occasion they will though it may not follow that the ministry are therefore for the pretender yet it does not also follow that there is no danger of the protestant succession from the employing those sort of people for what if the queen should die the ministry it is hoped are established in the interest of their queen and country and therefore it has been argued that supposing the ministry had the pretender in their eye yet that it is irrational to suggest that they can have any such view during the life of her present majesty nay even those professed jacobites who we spoke of just now cannot be so ungrateful to think of deposing the queen who has been so bountiful so kind so exceeding good to them as in several cases to suffer them to be brought into the management of her own affairs when by their character they might have been thought dangerous even to her person thus winning and engaging them by her bounty and the confidence that has been placed in them not to attempt anything to her prejudice without the most monstrous ingratitude without flying in the face of all that sense of honour and obligation which it is possible for men of common sense to entertain and it can hardly be thought that even papists themselves under the highest possessions of their religious zeal can conquer the native aversions they must have to such abominable ingratitude or to think of bringing in the pretender upon this protestant nation even while the queen shall be on the throne but though this may and some doubt that also tie up their hands during the queen s life yet they themselves give us but small reason to expect anything from them afterward and it will be hard to find anybody to vouch for them then these very jacobites papists and professed enemies to the revolution may be supposed upon these pretensions to be quiet and offer no violence to the present establishment while her majesty has the possession and while that life lasts to which they are so much indebted for her royal goodness and clemency but what would they do if the queen should die come we next to the french king we are told that not the french king only but even the whole french nation are wonderfully forward to acknowledge the obligation they are under to the justice and favour which they have received from her majesty in the putting an end to the war a war which lay heavy upon them and threatened the very name of the french nation with ruin and much more threatened the glory of the french court and of their great monarch with an entire overthrow a total eclipse a war which by their own confession it was impossible for them long to have supported the expenses of and which by the great superiority of the allies became dreadful to them and that every campaign more than the other a war which they were in such pain to see the end of that they tried all the powers and courts in christendom who were the least neutral to engage a mediation in order to a treaty and all in vain and a war which if her majesty had not inclined to put an end to must have ended perhaps to the disadvantage and confusion of both france and spain if not of all christendom the obligations the french are under for the bringing this war to so just and honourable a conclusion are not at all concealed nay the french themselves have not been backward to make them public the declarations made by the french king of his sincerity in the overtures made for a general peace the protestations of his being resolved to enter into an entire confidence and a league offensive and defensive with the queen s majesty for the preservation of the peace of chr,1

settle at home as he directed so he would not have so much hand in my misfortunes as to give me any encouragement to go away and to close all he told me i had my elder brother for an example to whom he had used the same earnest persuasions to keep him from going into the low country wars but could not prevail his young desires prompting him to run into the army where he was killed and though he said he would not cease to pray for me yet he would venture to say to me that if i did take this foolish step god would not bless me and i should have leisure hereafter to reflect upon having neglected his counsel when there might be none to assist in my recovery i observed in this last part of his discourse which was truly prophetic though i suppose my father did not know it to be so himself x x i say i observed the tears run down his face very plentifully especially when he spoke of my brother who was killed and that when he spoke of my having leisure to repent and none to assist me he was so moved that he broke off the discourse and told me his heart was so full he could say no more to me i was sincerely affected with this discourse and indeed who could be otherwise and i resolved not to think of going abroad any more but to settle at home according to my father x x s desire but alas a few days wore it all off and in short to prevent any of my father x x s further importunities in a few weeks after i resolved to run quite away from him however i did not act quite so hastily as the first heat of my resolution prompted but i took my mother at a time when i thought her a little more pleasant than ordinary and told her that my thoughts were so entirely bent upon seeing the world that i should never settle to anything with resolution enough to go through with it and my father had better give me his consent than force me to go without it that i was now eighteen years old which was too late to go apprentice to a trade or clerk to an attorney that i was sure if i did i should never serve out my time but i should certainly run away from my master before my time was out and go to sea and if she would speak to my father to let me go one voyage abroad if i came home again and did not like it i would go no more and i would promise by a double diligence to recover the time that i had lost this put my mother into a great passion she told me she knew it would be to no purpose to speak to my father upon any such subject that he knew too well what was my interest to give his consent to anything so much for my hurt and that she wondered how i could think of any such thing after the discourse i had had with my father and such kind and tender expressions as she knew my father had used to me and that in short if i would ruin myself there was no help for me but i might depend i should never have their consent to it that for her part she would not have so much hand in my destruction and i should never have it to say that my mother was willing when my father was not though my mother refused to move it to my father yet i heard afterwards that she reported all the discourse to him and that my father after showing a great concern at it said to her with a sigh x x cthat boy might be happy if he would stay at home but if he goes abroad he will be the most miserable wretch that ever was born i can give no consent to it x x d it was not till almost a year after this that i broke loose though in the meantime i continued obstinately deaf to all proposals of settling to business and frequently expostulated with my father and mother about their being so positively determined against what they knew my inclinations prompted me to but being one day at hull where i went casually and without any purpose of making an elopement at that time but i say being there and one of my companions being about to sail to london in his father x x s ship and prompting me to go with them with the common allurement of seafaring men that it should cost me nothing for my passage i consulted neither father nor mother any more nor so much as sent them word of it but leaving them to hear of it as they might without asking god x x s blessing or my father x x s without any consideration of circumstances or consequences and in an ill hour god knows on the st of september i went on board a ship bound for london never any young adventurer x x s misfortunes i believe began sooner or continued longer than mine the ship was no sooner out of the humber than the wind began to blow and the sea to rise in a most frightful manner and as i had never been at sea before i was most inexpressibly sick in body and terrified in mind i began now seriously to reflect upon what i had done and how justly i was overtaken by the judgment of heaven for my wicked leaving my father x x s house and abandoning my duty all the good counsels of my parents my father x x s tears and my mother x x s entreaties came now fresh into my mind and my conscience which was not yet come to the pitch of hardness to which it has since reproached me with the contempt of advice and the breach of my duty to god and my father all this while the storm increased and the sea went very high though nothing like what i have seen many times since no nor what i saw a few days after but it was enough to affect me then who was but a young sailor and had never known anything of the matter i expected every wave would have swallowed us up and that every time the ship fell down as i thought it did in the trough or hollow of the sea we should never rise more in this agony of mind i made many vows and resolutions that if it would please god to spare my life in this one voyage if ever i got once my foot upon dry land again i would go directly home to my father and never set

course of weeks an unexpectedly small appointment to go to hanover under truchsess von waldburg and announce our accession which is but a simple mostly formal service yet perhaps what bielfeld is best

due compliment and condolence almost on the first day of the new reign first messenger of all on that errand britannic majesty evidently in a conciliatory humor having his dangerous spanish war on hand britannic majesty in person shortly after gets across to hanover and friedrich despatches truchsess with bielfeld adjoined to return the courtesy friedrich does not neglect these points of good manners along with which something of substantial may be privately conjoined for example if he had in secret his eye on julich and berg could anything be fitter than to ascertain what the french will think of such an enterprise what the french and next to them what the english that is to say hanoverians who meddle much in affairs of the reich for these reasons and others he likewise probably with more study than in the bielfeld case despatches colonel camas to make his compliment at the french court and in an expert way take soundings there camas a fat sedate military gentleman of advanced years full of observation experience and sound sense with one arm which he makes do the work of two and nobody can notice that the other arm resting in his coat breast is of cork so expert is he will do in this matter what is feasible probably not much for the present he is to call on voltaire as he passes who is in holland again at the hague for some months back and deliver him a little cask of hungary wine which probably his majesty had thought exquisite of which and the other insignificant passages between them we hear more than enough in the writings and correspondences of voltaire about this time in such way friedrich disposes of his bielfelds who are rather numerous about him now and henceforth adventurers from all quarters especially of the literary type in hopes of being employed

mere hope and exuberance as yet and may even be made worse than nothing according to the knights he shall manage to have happily it proved a successful new order in this last all essential particular

south seas a trade carried on with the greatest advantage and to the greatest degree that any particular commerce has been carried on in the world for many ages past insomuch that we found the return of silver that came back to france by those ships was not only the enriching of the merchants of st malo rochelle and other ports in france some of whom we saw get immense estates in a few years even to a million sterling a man but it was evident the king of france himself was enabled by the circulation of so much bullion through his mints to carry on that war with very great advantage it was just at the close of this war when some merchants of london looking with envy on the success of that trade and how the french notwithstanding the peace would apparently carry it on for some years at least to infinite advantage began to consider whether it might not be possible to come in for a portion of it with france as they were allied to spain and yet go abroad in the nature of a private cruiser to bring this to pass it was thought proper in the first place to get a share if possible in a new design of an east india trade in flanders just then intended to be set up by some british merchants by the assistance of an imperial charter or at least under colour of it and so we might go to sea in a threefold capacity to be made use of as occasion might present viz when on the coast of new spain we sought to trade we were frenchmen had a french captain and a sufficient number of french seamen and flemish or walloon seamen who spoke french so to appear on all proper occasions when at sea we met with any spanish ship worth our while we were english cruisers had letters of mart from england had no account of the peace and were fitted for the attack and when in the east indies we had occasion to trade either at the english or dutch settlements we should have imperial colours and two flemish merchants at least in appearance to transact everything as we found occasion however this last part of our project failed us that affair not being fully ripe as this mysterious equipment may be liable to some exceptions and perhaps to some inquiries i shall for the present conceal my name and that of the ship also by inquiries i mean inquiries of private persons concerned for as to public inquiries we have no uneasiness having acted nothing in contradiction to the rules and laws of our country but i say as to private persons it is thought fit to prevent their inquiries to which end the captain in whose name i write this gives me leave to make use of his name and conceal my own the ship sailed from the river the th of december and went directly over to the coast of flanders lying at an anchor in newport pitts as they are called where we took in our french captain jean michael merlotte who with thirty two french seamen came on board us in a large snow from dunkirk bringing with them one hundred and twenty two small ankers or rundlets of brandy and some hampers and casks of french wine in wickered bottles while we were here we lay under english colours with pendants flying our ship being upwards of five hundred ton and had forty six guns mounted manned with three hundred and fifty six men we took the more men on board because we resolved as occasion should present to fit ourselves with another ship which we did not question we should meet with in the south seas we had also a third design in our voyage though it may be esteemed an accident to the rest viz we were resolved to make some attempts for new discoveries as opportunity offered and we had two persons on board who were exceeding well qualified for our direction in this part all which was derived from the following occasion the person who was principally concerned in the adventure was a man not only of great wealth but of great importance he was particularly addicted to what we call new discoveries and it was indeed upon his genius to such things that the first thought of the voyage was founded this gentleman told me that he had already sent one ship fully equipped and furnished for a new attempt upon the north west or north east passages which had been so often in vain tried by former navigators and that he did not question the success because he had directed them by new measures and to steer a course that was never attempted yet and his design in our voyage was to make like discoveries towards the south pole where as he said and gave us very good reasons for it he did not doubt but we might discover even to the pole itself and find out new worlds and new seas which had never been heard of before with these designs this gentleman came into the other part of our project and contributed the more largely and with the more freedom to the whole upon that account in particular all the needful preparations for such discoveries were made wholly at his expense which i take notice of here as being most proper in the beginning of our story and that the reader may the less wonder at the particular way we took to perform a voyage which might with much more ease have been done by the usual and ordinary way we sailed from the coast of flanders the nd of january and without any extraordinary incident made the coast of galway in ireland the th where we stayed and took in a very extraordinary store of provisions three times as much as usual the beef being also well pickled or double packed that we might have a sufficient reserve for the length of our voyage resolving also to spare it as much as possible we had a very rich cargo on board consisting of all sorts of british manufactures suitable for the spanish trade in their west indies and as we aimed at nothing of trade till we came to the spanish coast we sailed directly,1

words be for the pretender and this can be no otherwise understood than to have a design however remote and upon whatever views to bring him in to possess the throne of these kingdoms the matter then being laid down thus as sincerely and plainly as possible we come to the question point blank and think it our duty to say with the greatest sincerity that we do not believe the ministry are in any kind or with any prospect near or remote acting for or with a design or view to bring in the pretender having granted this we must however to prevent any breaking in by way of cavil on one hand or triumph on the other subjoin immediately that we do not in the least grant by this that the protestant succession is in no danger even from several of the measures now taken in the world it is far from any reflection upon the ministry to say that however they may act upon a right sincere principle for the protestant succession in all they do which as above we profess to believe yet that many of the tools they make use of are of another make and have no edge to cut any other way no thoughts to move them towards any other end no other centre which they can have any tendency to that the pretender s interest is the magnet which draws them by its secret influence to point to him as their pole that they have their aim at his establishment here and own it to be their aim and as they are not shy to profess it among themselves so their conduct in many things makes it sufficiently public this is not meant as any reflection upon the ministry for making use of such men the late ministry did the same and every ministry will and must employ men sometimes not as they always join with them in their politic principles but as either the men are found useful in their several employments or as the ministry may be under other circumstances which makes it necessary to them to employ them nor as the review well enough observed does it follow that because the ministry have employed or joined with jacobites in the public affairs that therefore they must have done it with a jacobite principle but let the ministry employ these men by what necessity or upon what occasion they will though it may not follow that the ministry are therefore for the pretender yet it does not also follow that there is no danger of the protestant succession from the employing those sort of people for what if the queen should die the ministry it is hoped are established in the interest of their queen and country and therefore it has been argued that supposing the ministry had the pretender in their eye yet that it is irrational to suggest that they can have any such view during the life of her present majesty nay even those professed jacobites who we spoke of just now cannot be so ungrateful to think of deposing the queen who has been so bountiful so kind so exceeding good to them as in several cases to suffer them to be brought into the management of her own affairs when by their character they might have been thought dangerous even to her person thus winning and engaging them by her bounty and the confidence that has been placed in them not to attempt anything to her prejudice without the most monstrous ingratitude without flying in the face of all that sense of honour and obligation which it is possible for men of common sense to entertain and it can hardly be thought that even papists themselves under the highest possessions of their religious zeal can conquer the native aversions they must have to such abominable ingratitude or to think of bringing in the pretender upon this protestant nation even while the queen shall be on the throne but though this may and some doubt that also tie up their hands during the queen s life yet they themselves give us but small reason to expect anything from them afterward and it will be hard to find anybody to vouch for them then these very jacobites papists and professed enemies to the revolution may be supposed upon these pretensions to be quiet and offer no violence to the present establishment while her majesty has the possession and while that life lasts to which they are so much indebted for her royal goodness and clemency but what would they do if the queen should die come we next to the french king we are told that not the french king only but even the whole french nation are wonderfully forward to acknowledge the obligation they are under to the justice and favour which they have received from her majesty in the putting an end to the war a war which lay heavy upon them and threatened the very name of the french nation with ruin and much more threatened the glory of the french court and of their great monarch with an entire overthrow a total eclipse a war which by their own confession it was impossible for them long to have supported the expenses of and which by the great superiority of the allies became dreadful to them and that every campaign more than the other a war which they were in such pain to see the end of that they tried all the powers and courts in christendom who were the least neutral to engage a mediation in order to a treaty and all in vain and a war which if her majesty had not inclined to put an end to must have ended perhaps to the disadvantage and confusion of both france and spain if not of all christendom the obligations the french are under for the bringing this war to so just and honourable a conclusion are not at all concealed nay the french themselves have not been backward to make them public the declarations made by the french king of his sincerity in the overtures made for a general peace the protestations of his being resolved to enter into an entire confidence and a league offensive and defensive with the queen s majesty for the

to lay before us such prospects of national advantages and such views of prosperity as would be sufficient to prevail with those who have their eyes upon the good of their country and of their posterity after them that then a case so popular and of so much consequence as this is may not want such due supports as the nature of the thing will allow and especially since the advantages and good consequences of the thing itself are so many and so easy to be seen as his friends allege why should not the good people of britain be made easy and their fears be turned into peaceable satisfaction by seeing that this devil may not be so black as he is painted and that the noise made of the pretender and the frightful things said of his coming and of his being received here may not be made greater scarecrows to us than they really are and after all that has been said if it should appear that the advantages of the pretender s succession are really greater to us and the dangers less to us than those of the succession of hanover then much of their difficulties would be over who standing neuter as to persons appear against the pretender only because they are made to believe strange and terrible things of what shall befall the nation in case of his coming in such as popery slavery french power destroying of our credit and devouring our funds as that scandalous scribbler the review has been labouring to suggest with many other things which we shall endeavour to expose to you as they deserve if we say it should appear then that the dangers and disadvantages of the pretender s succession are less than those of the house of hanover who because of an act of parliament you know must not be called pretenders then there will remain nothing more to be said on that score but the debate must be of the reasonableness and justice on either side for their admittance and there we question not but the side we are really pleading for will have the advantage to begin then with that most popular and affrighting argument now made use of as the bugbear of the people against several other things besides jacobitism we mean french greatness it is most evident that the fear of this must by the nature of the thing be effectually removed upon our receiving the pretender the grounds and reasons why french greatness is rendered formidable to us and so much weight supposed to be in it that like the name of scanderberg we fright our very children with it lie only in this that we suggest the king of france being a professed enemy to the peace and the liberty of great britain will most certainly as soon as he can a little recover himself exercise all that formidable power to put the pretender upon us and not only to place him upon the throne of great britain but to maintain and hold him up in it against all the opposition either of the people of britain or the confederate princes leagued with the elector of hanover who are in the interest of his claim or of his party now it is evident that upon a peaceable admitting this person whom they call the pretender to receive and enjoy the crown here all that formidable power becomes your friend and the being so must necessarily take off from it everything that is called terrible forasmuch as the greater terror and amusement the power we apprehend really carries with it the greater is the tranquillity and satisfaction which accrues to us when we have the friendship of that power which was so formidable to us before the power of france is represented at this time very terrible and the writers who speak of it apply it warm to our imaginations as that from whence we ought justly to apprehend the impossibility of keeping out the pretender and this notwithstanding they allow themselves at the same time to suppose all the confederate powers of europe to be engaged as well by their own interest as by the new treaties of barrier and guarantee to support and to assist the claim of the elector of hanover and his party now if this power be so great and so formidable as they allege will it not on the other side add a proportion of increase to our satisfaction that this power will be wholly in friendship and league with us and engaged to concern itself for the quieting our fears of other foreign invaders forasmuch as having once concerned itself to set the person of the pretender upon the throne it cannot be supposed but it shall be equally concerned to support and maintain him in that possession as what will mightily conduce to the carrying on the other projects of his greatness and glory with the rest of europe in which it will be very much his interest to secure himself from any opposition he might meet with from this nation or from such as might be rendered powerful by our assistance an eminent instance we have of this in the mighty efforts the french nation have made for planting and preserving when planted a grandson of france upon the throne of spain and how eminent are the advantages to france from the success of that undertaking of what less consequence then would it be to the august monarchy of france to secure and engage to himself the constant friendship and assistance of the power of great britain which he would necessarily do by the placing this person upon the throne who would thereby in gratitude be engaged to contribute his utmost in return to the king of france for the carrying on his glorious designs in the rest of europe while then we become thus necessary to the king of france reason dictates that he would be our fast friend our constant confederate our ally firmly engaged to secure our sovereign and protect our people from the insults and attempts of all the world being thus engaged reciprocally with the king of france there must necessarily be an end of all the fears

fine and the expense of his discharge gratitude and fidelity are inseparable from an honest man and it was this benevolent act that prompted de foe to support harley with his able and ingenious pen when anne lay lifeless and his benefactor in the vicissitude of party was persecuted by faction and overpowered though not conquered by violence the talents and perseverance of de foe began now to be properly estimated and as a firm supporter of the administration he was sent by lord godolphin to scotland on an errand which as he says was far from being unfit for a sovereign to direct or an honest

engage in religious controversy and the furious contest civil and ecclesiastical which ensued on the accession of queen anne gave him an opportunity of gratifying his favourite passion he therefore published a tract entitled the shortest way with the dissenters or proposals for the establishment of the church which contained an ironical recommendation of persecution but written in so serious a strain that many persons particularly dissenters at first mistook its real intention the high church party however saw and felt the ridicule and by their influence a prosecution was commenced against him and a proclamation published in the gazette offering a reward for his apprehension when de foe found with how much rigour himself and his pamphlet were about to be treated he at first secreted himself but his printer and bookseller being taken into custody he surrendered being resolved as he expresses it to throw himself upon the favour of government rather than that others should be ruined for his mistakes in july he was brought to trial found guilty and sentenced to be imprisoned to stand in the pillory and to pay a fine of two hundred marks he underwent the infamous part of the punishment with great fortitude and it seems to have been generally thought that he was treated with unreasonable severity so far was he from being ashamed of his fate himself that he wrote a hymn to

fine and the expense of his discharge gratitude and fidelity are inseparable from an honest man and it was this benevolent act that prompted de foe to support harley with his able and ingenious pen when anne lay lifeless and his benefactor in the vicissitude of party was persecuted by faction and overpowered though not conquered by violence the talents and perseverance of de foe began now to be properly estimated and as a firm supporter of the administration he was sent by lord godolphin to scotland on an errand which as he says was far from being unfit for a sovereign to direct or an honest man to perform his knowledge of commerce and revenue his powers of insinuation and above all his readiness of pen were deemed of no small utility in promoting the union of the two kingdoms of which he wrote an able history in with two dedications one to the queen and another to the duke of queensbury soon afterwards he unhappily by some equivocal writings rendered himself suspected by both parties so that he once more retired to newington in hopes of spending the remainder of his days in peace his pension being withdrawn and wearied with politics he began to compose works of a different kind the year may therefore be regarded as the period of de foe s political life faction henceforth found other advocates and parties procured other writers to disseminate their suggestions and to propagate their falsehoods in de foe published the family instructor a work inculcating the domestic duties in a lively manner by narration and dialogue and displaying much knowledge of life in the

where was a den and laid me down in that place to sleep and as i slept i dreamed a dream i dreamed and behold i saw a man clothed with rags standing in a certain place with his face from his own house a book in his hand and a great burden upon his back i looked and saw him open the book and read therein and as he read he wept and trembled and not being able longer to contain he brake out with a lamentable cry saying what shall i do bedford jail in which bunyan was twelve years a prisoner in this plight therefore he went home and restrained himself as long as he could that his wife and children should not perceive his distress but he could not be silent long because that his trouble increased wherefore at length he brake his mind to his wife and children and thus he began to talk to them oh my dear wife said he and you my sweet children i your dear friend am in myself undone by reason of a burden that lieth hard upon me moreover i am told to a certainty that this our city will be burned with fire from heaven in which fearful overthrow both myself with thee my wife and you my sweet babes shall miserably come to ruin except some way of escape can be found whereby we may be delivered at this all his family were sore amazed not for that they believed that what he had said to them was true but because they thought that some frenzy or madness had got into his head therefore it drawing towards night and they hoping that sleep might settle his brain with all haste they got him to bed but the night was as troublesome to him as the day wherefore instead of sleeping he spent it in sighs and tears so when the morning was come they would know how he did he told them worse and worse he also set to talking to them again but they began to be hardened they also thought to drive away his madness by harsh and surly treatment of him sometimes they would ridicule sometimes they would chide and sometimes they would quite neglect him wherefore he began to retire himself to his chamber to pray for and pity them and also to sorrow over his own misery he would also walk solitary in the fields sometimes reading and sometimes praying and thus for some days he spent his time sidenote christian s distress of mind now i saw upon a time when he was walking in the fields that he was as he was wont reading in his book and greatly distressed in his mind and as he read he burst out as he had done before crying what shall i do to be saved i saw also that he looked this way and that way as if he would run yet he stood still because as i perceived he could not tell which way to go i looked then and saw a man named evangelist coming to him who asked wherefore dost thou cry illustration evangelist points to wicket gate page he answered sir i read in the book in my hand that i am condemned to die and after that to come to judgment and i find that i am not willing to do the first nor able to do the second then said evangelist why not willing to die since this life is troubled with so many evils the man answered because i fear that this burden that is upon my back will sink me lower than the grave and i shall fall into tophet and sir if i be not fit to go to prison i am not fit to go to judgment and from thence to death and the thoughts of these things make me cry tophet here means hell then said evangelist if this be thy condition why standest thou still he answered because i know not whither to go then he gave him a parchment roll and there was written within flee from the wrath to come the man therefore read it and looking upon evangelist very carefully said whither must i fly then said evangelist pointing with his finger over a very wide field do you see yonder wicket gate the man said no then said the other do you see yonder shining light he said i think i do then said evangelist keep that light in your eye and go up directly thereto so shalt thou see the gate at which when thou knockest it shall be told thee what thou shalt do so i saw in my dream that the man began to run now he had not run far from his own door when his wife and children perceiving it began to cry after him to return but the man put his fingers in his ears and ran on crying life life eternal life so he looked not behind him but fled towards the middle of the plain sidenote christian flees from the city the neighbors also came out to see him run and as he ran some mocked others threatened and some cried after him to return and among those that did so there were two that resolved to fetch him back by force the name of the one was obstinate and the name

young swift says that esther johnson was born on march in the parish register of richmond which shows that she was baptized on march her name is given as hester but she signed her will esther the name by which she was always known swift says her father was a younger brother of a good family in nottinghamshire her mother of a lower degree and indeed she had little to boast in her birth mrs johnson had two children esther and ann and lived at moor park as companion to lady giffard temple s widowed sister another member of the household afterwards to be esther s constant companion was rebecca dingley a relative of the temple family she was a year or two older than swift the lonely young man of twenty two was both playfellow and teacher of the delicate child of eight how he taught her to write has been charmingly brought before us in the painting exhibited by miss dicksee at the royal academy a few years ago he advised her what books to read and instructed her as he says in the principles of honour and virtue from which she never swerved in any one action or moment of her life by swift had grown tired of his position and finding that temple who valued his services was slow in finding him preferment he left moor park in order to carry out his resolve to go into the church he was ordained and obtained the prebend of kilroot near belfast where he carried on a flirtation with a miss waring whom he called varina but in may temple made proposals which induced swift to return to moor park where he was employed in preparing temple s memoirs and correspondence for publication and in supporting the side taken by temple in the letters of phalaris controversy by writing the battle of the books which was however not published until on his return to temple s house swift found his old playmate grown from a sickly child into a girl of fifteen in perfect health she came he says to be looked upon as one of the most beautiful graceful and agreeable young women in london only a little too fat her hair was blacker than a raven and every feature of her face in perfection on his death in january temple left a will dated directing the payment of pounds each with half a year s wages to bridget johnson and all my other servants and leaving a lease of some land in monistown county wicklow to esther johnson servant to my sister giffard by a codicil of february temple left pounds to mr jonathan swift now living with me it may be added that by her will of proved in the following year lady giffard gave pounds to mrs moss mrs bridget johnson who had married richard mose or moss lady giffard s steward the will proceeds to mrs hester sic johnson i give pounds with the pounds i put into the exchequer for her life and my own and declare the pounds to be hers which i am told is there in my name upon the survivorship and for which she has constantly sent over her certificate and received the interest i give her besides my two little silver candlesticks temple left in swift s hands the task of publishing his posthumous works a duty which afterwards led to a quarrel with lady giffard and other members of the family many years later swift told lord palmerston that he stopped at moor park solely for the benefit of temple s conversation and advice and the opportunity of pursuing his studies at temple s death he was as far to seek as ever in the summer of however he was offered and accepted the post of secretary and chaplain to the earl of berkeley one of the lords justices but when he reached ireland he found that the secretaryship had been given to another he soon however obtained the living of laracor agher and rathbeggan and the prebend of dunlavin in st patrick s cathedral dublin the total value of these preferments was about pounds a year an income which miss waring seems to have thought enough to justify him in marrying swift s reply to the lady whom he had singled out at first from the rest of women could only have been written with the intention of breaking off the connection and accordingly we hear no more of poor varina at laracor a mile or two from trim and twenty miles from dublin swift ministered to a congregation of about fifteen persons and had abundant leisure for cultivating his garden making a canal after the dutch fashion of moor park planting willows and rebuilding the vicarage as chaplain to lord berkeley he spent much of his time in dublin he was on intimate terms with lady berkeley and her daughters one of whom is best known by her married name of lady betty germaine and through them he had access to the fashionable society of dublin when lord berkeley returned to england in april swift after taking his doctor s degree at dublin went with him and soon afterwards published anonymously a political pamphlet a discourse on the contests and dissentions in athens and rome when he returned to ireland in september he was accompanied by stella to give esther johnson the name by which she is best known and her friend mrs dingley stella s fortune was about pounds and the property temple had left her was in county wicklow swift very much for his own satisfaction who had few friends or acquaintance in ireland persuaded stella now twenty years old that living was cheaper there than in england and that a better return was obtainable on money the ladies took his advice and

latter sparingly but they will not have imbued her with that hope for some transcendental paradise of affection which so often fills and exalts the hearts of our daughters here at home she is moderate in her aspirations requiring less excitement than an english girl and never forgetting the solid necessities of life as they are so often forgotten here in england in associating with young men an english girl will always remember that in each one she so meets she may find an admirer whom she may possibly love or an admirer whom she may probably be called on to repel she is ever conscious of the fact of this position and a romance is thus engendered which if it may at times be dangerous is at any rate always charming but the german girl in her simplicity has no such consciousness as you and i my reader might probably become dear friends were we to meet and know each other so may the german girl learn to love the fair haired youth with whom chance has for a time associated her but to her mind there occurs no suggestive reason why it should be so no probability that the youth may regard her in such light because that chance has come to pass she can therefore give him her hand without trepidation and talk with him for half an hour when called on to do so as calmly as she might do with his sister such a one was isa heine at the time of which i am writing we english in our passion for daily excitement might call her phlegmatic but we should call her so unjustly life to her was a serious matter of which the daily duties and daily wants were sufficient to occupy her thoughts she was her mother s companion the instructress of both her brother and her sister and the charm of her father s vacant hours with such calls upon her time and so many realities around her her imagination did not teach her to look for joys beyond those of her present life and home when love and marriage should come to her as come they probably might she would endeavour to attune herself to a new happiness and a new sphere of duties in the meantime she was contented to keep her mother s accounts and look after her brother and sister up two pair of stairs in the ludwigs strasse but change would certainly come we may prophesy for isa heine was a beautiful girl tall and graceful comely to the eye and fit in every way to be loved and cherished as the partner of a man s home i have said that an english clerk made a part of that small establishment in the dingy banking office in the schrannen platz and i must say a word or two of herbert onslow in his early career he had not been fortunate his father with means sufficiently moderate and with a family more than sufficiently large had sent him to a public school at which he had been very idle and then to one of the universities at which he had run into debt and had therefore left without a degree when this occurred a family council of war had been held among the onslows and it was decided that herbert should be sent off to the banking house of heines at munich there being a cousinship between the families and some existing connections of business it was therefore so settled and herbert willing enough to see the world as he considered he should do by going to munich started for his german home with injunctions very tender from his mother and very solemn from his aggrieved father but there was nothing bad at the heart about young onslow and if the solemn father had well considered it he might perhaps have felt that those debts at cambridge reflected more fault on him than on his son when herbert arrived at munich his cousins the heines far away cousins though they were behaved kindly to him they established him at first in lodgings where he was boarded with many others having heard somewhat of his early youth but when madame heine at the end of twelve months perceived that he was punctual at the bank and that his allowances which though moderate in england were handsome in munich carried him on without debt she opened her motherly arms and suggested to his mother and to himself that he should live with them in this way he also was domiciled up two pairs of stairs in the palatial residence in the ludwigs strasse but all this happened long ago isa heine had been only seventeen when her cousin had first come to munich and had made acquaintance with him rather as a child than as a woman and when as she ripened into womanhood this young man came more closely among them it did not strike her that the change would affect her more powerfully than it would the others her uncle and father she knew had approved of herbert at the bank and herbert had shown that he could be steady therefore he was to be taken into their family paying his annual subsidy instead of being left with strangers at the boarding house all this was very simple to her she assisted in mending his linen as she did her father s she visited his room daily as she visited all the others she took notice of his likings and dislikings as touching their table arrangement but by no means such notice as she did of her father s and without any flutter inwardly in her imagination or outwardly as regarded the world she made him one of the family so things went on for a year nay so things went on for two years with her after herbert onslow had come to the ludwigs strasse but the matter had been regarded in a very different light by herbert himself when the proposition had been made to him his first idea had been that so close a connection with a girl so very pretty would be delightful he had blushed as he had given in his adhesion but madame heine when she saw the blush had attributed it to anything but the true cause when isa had asked him as to his wants,2

proper but an association of states in the nature of contract merely can it as a contract be peaceably unmade by less than all the parties who made it one party to a contract may violate it break it so to speak but does it not require all to lawfully rescind it descending from these general principles we find the proposition that in legal contemplation the union is perpetual confirmed by the history of the union itself the union is much older than the constitution it was formed in fact by the articles of association in it was matured and continued by the declaration of independence in it was further matured and the faith of all the then thirteen states expressly plighted and engaged that it should be perpetual by the articles of confederation in and finally in one of the declared objects for ordaining and establishing the constitution was to form a more perfect union but if the destruction of the union by one or by a part only of the states be lawfully possible the union is less perfect than before the constitution having lost the vital element of perpetuity it follows from these views that no state upon its own mere motion can lawfully get out of the union that resolves and ordinances to that effect are legally void and that acts of violence within any state or states against the authority of the united states are insurrectionary or revolutionary according to circumstances i therefore consider that in view of the constitution and the laws the union is unbroken and to the extent of my ability i shall take care as the constitution itself expressly enjoins upon me that the laws of the union be faithfully executed in all the states doing this i deem to be only a simple duty on my part and i shall perform it so far as practicable unless my rightful masters the american people shall withhold the requisite means or in some authoritative manner direct the contrary i trust this will not be regarded as a menace but only as the declared purpose of the union that it will constitutionally defend and maintain itself in doing this there needs to be no bloodshed or violence and there shall be none unless it be forced upon the national authority the power confided to me will be used to hold occupy and possess the property and places belonging to the government and to collect the duties and imposts but beyond what may be necessary for these objects there will be no invasion no using of force against or among the people anywhere where hostility to the united states in any interior locality shall be so great and universal as to prevent competent resident citizens from holding the federal offices there will be no attempt to force obnoxious strangers among the people for that object while the strict legal right may exist in the government to enforce the exercise of these offices the attempt to do so would be so irritating and so nearly impracticable withal that i deem it better to forego for the time the uses of such offices the mails unless repelled will continue to be furnished in all parts of the union so far as possible the people everywhere shall have that sense of perfect security which is most favorable to calm thought and reflection the course here indicated will be followed unless current events and experience shall show a modification or change to be proper and in every case and exigency my best discretion will be exercised according to circumstances actually existing and with a view and a hope of a peaceful solution of the national troubles and the restoration of fraternal sympathies and affections that there are persons in one section or another who seek to destroy the union at all events and are glad of any pretext to do it i will neither affirm nor deny but if there be such i need address no word to them to those however who really love the union may i not speak before entering upon so grave a matter as the destruction of our national fabric with all its benefits its memories and its hopes would it not be wise to ascertain precisely why we do it will you hazard so desperate a step while there is any possibility that any portion of the ills you fly from have no real existence will you while the certain ills you fly to are greater than all the real ones you fly from will you risk the commission of so fearful a mistake all profess to be content in the union if all constitutional rights can be maintained is it true then that any right plainly written in the constitution has been denied i think not happily the human mind is so constituted that no party can reach to the audacity of doing this think if you can of a single instance in which a plainly written provision of the constitution has ever been denied if by the mere force of numbers a majority should deprive a minority of any clearly written constitutional right it might in a moral point of view justify revolution certainly would if such a right were a vital one but such is not our case all the vital rights of minorities and of individuals are so plainly assured to them by affirmations and negations guaranties and prohibitions in the constitution that controversies never arise concerning them but no organic law can ever be framed with a provision specifically applicable to every question which may occur in practical administration no foresight can anticipate nor any document of

glorious temples in honor of the deity and convenience is more consulted than taste perhaps in all that relates to ecclesiastical architecture nevertheless a sensible improvement in this respect has occurred within the last few years to which we shall elsewhere advert it will be in their trade their resources their activity and their influence on the rest of the world as well as in their population that the towns of manhattan will be first entitled to rank with the larger capitals of europe so obvious rapid and natural has been the advance of all the places that it is not easy for the mind to regard anything belonging to them as extraordinary or out of rule there is not a port in the whole country that is less indebted to art and the fostering hand of government than this it is true certain forts most of them of very doubtful necessity have been constructed for defence but no attack having ever been contemplated or if contemplated attempted they have been dead letters in the history of its progress we are not aware that government has ever expended one cent in the waters of manhattan except for the surveys construction of the aforesaid military works and the erection of the lighthouses that form a part of the general provision for the safe navigation of the entire coast some money has been expended for the improvement of the shallow waters of the hudson but it has been as much or more for the advantage of the upper towns and the trade coastwise generally than for the special benefit of new york the immense natural advantages of the bays and islands at the mouth of the hudson have in a great degree superseded the necessity of such assistance nature has made every material provision for a mart of the first importance and perhaps it has been fortunate that the towns have been left like healthful and vigorous children managed by prudent parents to take the inclination and growth pointed out to them by this safest and best of guides london is indebted to artificial causes in a great degree for its growth and power that great law of trade which renders settling places indispensable has contributed to her prosperity and continued ascendency long after the day when rival ports are carrying away her fleets and commerce she is a proof of the difficulty of shaking a commercial superiority long established scarce a cargo that enters the ports of the kingdom that does not pay tribute to her bankers or merchants but london is a political capital and that in a country where the representation of the government is more imposing possessing greater influence than in any other christian nation the english aristocracy which wields the real authority of the state here makes its annual exhibition of luxury and wealth such as the world has never beheld anywhere else ancient rome possibly excepted and has had a large share in rendering london what it is new york has none of this adventitious aid both of the governments that of the united states and that of the state have long been taken from her leaving her nothing of this sort but her own local authorities but representation forms no part of the machinery of american policy it is supposed that man is too intellectual and philosophical to need it in this intellectual and philosophical country par excellence although such is the theory the whole struggle in private life is limited to the impression made by representation in the hands of individuals that which the government has improvidently cast aside society has seized upon and hundreds who have no claim to distinction beyond the possession of money profit by the mistake to place themselves in positions perhaps that they are not always exactly qualified to fill of all social usurpations that of mere money is the least tolerable as one may have a very full purse with empty brains and vulgar tastes and habits the wisdom of thus throwing the control of a feature of society that is of much more moment than is commonly supposed into the chapter of commercial accidents may well he questioned some crude attempts have been made to bring the circles of new york within the control of a code

should have got into such a scrape in spite of his grief however popanilla soon found that the ardency of his passion evaporated under a smoking sun and exhausted he was about to return home from his fruitless search when his attention was attracted by a singular appearance he observed before him on the shore a square and hitherto unseen form he watched it for some minutes but it was motionless he drew nearer and observed it with intense attention but if it were a being it certainly was fast asleep he approached close to its side but it neither moved nor breathed he applied his nose to the

hold me the stupids unless i was found guilty i asked the colonel what he considered the first duty of a soldier ere he could reply the president of the united states rose and informed the court that my foe the admiral had suggested bravery and that prompting a witness wasn t fair the president of the court immediately ordered the admiral s mouth to be filled with leaves and tied up with string i

how disgracefully the court martial ended as to our marriage would my people acknowledge it at home or would my people acknowledge ours said the bride of tinkling again the two warriors exchanged

recognition even that we have no such philosophy stands here for the first time published in our language what english intellect could have chosen such a topic or by chance stumbled on it but for that

perhaps discursive enough is free to confess that never till these last months did the above very plain considerations on our total want of a philosophy of clothes occur to him and then by quite foreign suggestion by the arrival namely of a new book from professor teufelsdrockh of weissnichtwo treating expressly of this subject and in a style which whether understood or not could not even by

wherein the toughest pearl diver may dive to his utmost depth and return not only with sea wreck but with true orients directly on the first perusal almost on the first deliberate inspection it became apparent that here a quite new branch of philosophy leading to as yet undescried ulterior results was disclosed farther what seemed scarcely less interesting a quite new human individuality an almost unexampled personal character that namely of professor teufelsdrockh the discloser of both which novelties as far as might be possible we resolved to master the significance but as man is emphatically a proselytizing creature no sooner was such mastery even fairly attempted than the new question arose how might this acquired good be imparted to others perhaps in equal need thereof how could the philosophy of clothes and the author of such philosophy be brought home in any measure to the business and bosoms of our own english nation for if new got gold is said to burn the pockets till it be cast forth into circulation much more may new truth here however difficulties occurred the first thought naturally was to publish article after article on this remarkable volume in such widely circulating critical journals as the editor might stand connected with or by money or love procure access to but on the other hand was it not clear that such matter as must here be revealed and treated of might endanger the circulation of any journal extant if indeed all party divisions in the state could have been abolished whig tory and radical embracing in discrepant union and all the journals of the nation could have been jumbled into one journal and the philosophy of clothes poured forth in incessant torrents therefrom the attempt had seemed possible but alas what vehicle of that

deliberately begun to state his objections than mrs norris interrupted him with a reply to them all whether stated or not my dear sir thomas i perfectly comprehend you and do justice to the generosity and delicacy of your notions which indeed are quite of a piece with your general conduct and i entirely agree with you in the main as to the propriety of doing everything one could by way of providing for a child one had in a manner taken into one s own hands and i am sure i should be the last person in the world to withhold my mite upon such an occasion having no children of my own who should i look to in any little matter i may ever have to bestow but the children of my sisters and i am sure mr norris is too just but you know i am a woman of few words and professions do not let us be frightened from a good deed by a trifle give a girl an education and introduce her properly into the world and ten to one but she has the means of settling well without farther expense to anybody a niece of ours sir thomas i may say or at least of yours would not grow up in this neighbourhood without many advantages i don t say she would be so handsome as her cousins i dare say she would not but she would be introduced into the society of this country under such very favourable circumstances as in all human probability would get her a creditable establishment you are thinking of your sons but do not you know that of all things upon earth that is the least likely to happen brought up as they would be always together like brothers and sisters it is morally impossible i never knew an instance of it it is in fact the only sure way of providing against the connexion suppose her a pretty girl and seen by tom or edmund for the first time seven years hence and i dare say there would be mischief the very idea of her having been suffered to grow up at a distance from us all in poverty and neglect would be enough to make either of the dear sweet tempered boys in love with her but breed her up with them from this time and suppose her even to have the beauty of an angel and she will never be more to either than a sister there is a great deal of truth in what you say replied sir thomas and far be it from me to throw any fanciful impediment in the way of a plan which would be so consistent with the relative situations of each i only meant to observe that it ought not to be lightly engaged in and that to make it really serviceable to mrs price and creditable to ourselves we must secure to the child or consider ourselves engaged to secure to her hereafter as circumstances may arise the provision of a gentlewoman if no such establishment should offer as you are so sanguine in expecting i thoroughly understand you cried mrs norris you are everything that is generous and considerate and i am sure we shall never disagree on this point whatever i can do as you well know i am always ready enough to do for the good of those i love and though i could never feel for this little girl the hundredth part of the regard i bear your own dear children nor consider her in any respect so much my own i should hate myself if i were capable of neglecting her is not she a sister s child and could i bear to see her want while i had a bit of bread to give her my dear sir thomas with all my faults i have a warm heart and poor as i am would rather deny myself the necessaries of life than do an ungenerous thing so if you are not against it i will write to my poor sister tomorrow and make the proposal and as soon as matters are settled i will engage to get the child to mansfield you shall have no trouble about it my own trouble you know i never regard i will send nanny to london on purpose and she may have a bed at her cousin the saddler s and the child be appointed to meet her there they may easily get her from portsmouth to town by the coach under the care of any creditable person that may chance to be going i dare say there is always some reputable tradesman s wife or other going up except to the attack on nanny s cousin sir thomas no longer made any objection and a more respectable though less economical rendezvous being accordingly substituted everything was considered as settled and the pleasures of so benevolent a scheme were already enjoyed the division of gratifying sensations ought not in strict justice to have been equal for sir thomas was fully resolved to be the real and consistent patron of the selected child and mrs norris had not the least intention of being at any expense whatever in her maintenance as far as walking talking and contriving reached she was thoroughly benevolent and nobody knew better how to dictate liberality to others but her love of money was equal to her love of directing and she knew quite as well how to save her own as to spend that of her friends having married on a narrower income than she had been used to look forward to she had from the first fancied a very strict line of economy necessary and what was begun as a matter of prudence soon grew into a matter of choice as an object of that needful solicitude which there were no children to supply had there been a family to provide for mrs norris might never have saved her money but having no care of that kind there was nothing to impede her frugality or lessen the comfort of making a yearly addition to an income which they had never lived up to under this infatuating principle counteracted by no real affection for her sister it was impossible for her to aim at more than the credit of projecting and arranging so expensive a charity though perhaps she might so little know herself as to walk home to the parsonage after this conversation in the happy belief of being the most liberal minded sister and aunt i,1

to this but nothing shall be said here it is merely of the cruelty of spirit that is thus engendered that we now speak success is the only test of merit words have lost their old significance and to deserve only is not meritorious v victis there are so many of them thompson says johnson the young poet when he has at last succeeded in getting the bosomest of his friends alone into his chamber with him have you happened to look at my iphigenia yet thompson can t say that he has he has been busy has had so many water parties and then somehow he doesn t think that he is very partial to modern poetry on subjects of old mythology of course however he means to read it some of these days i wish you would says johnson tendering a copy of the thin volume i really wish you would and let me have your candid opinion the press certainly have not noticed it much and what they have said has been very luke warm i am sorry for that says thompson looking grave and i did my best with it too you would hardly believe how hard i worked at it there is not a line that has not been weighed and written perhaps three times over i do not think i am conceited but i cannot but believe that there is something in it the reviewers are so jealous if a man has not a name they will give him credit for nothing and it is so hard to begin i am sure it is says thompson i don t expect fame and as for money of course i don t think of that but i should like to know that it had been read by one or two persons who could understand it i have given to it the best of my time the best of my labour i cannot but think that there is something in it thus pleads the unsuccessful one for mercy and thus answers to him the successful one with no grain of mercy in his composition my dear johnson my maxim is this that in this world every man gets in the long run exactly what he deserves did milton get what he deserved these are not the days of milton i don t want to hurt your feelings but old friends as we are i should not forgive myself if i didn t tell you what i really think poetry is all very well but you can t create a taste for it if it doesn t exist nobody that i know of cares a d for iphigenia you think i should change my subject then to tell you the truth i think you should change your trade this is the third attempt you know i dare say they are very good in their way but if the world liked them the world would have found it out by this time vox populi vox dei that is my motto i don t trust my own judgment i trust that of the public if you will take my advice you will give up iphigenia and the rest of them you see you are doing nothing whatever at the bar c c and thus johnson is left without a scrap of comfort a word of consolation a spark of sympathy and yet he had given to that iphigenia of his the best that was in him to give had his publisher sold ten thousand copies of it how thompson would have admired it how he would have pressed the poet in his arms and have given him champagne up at richmond but who now has sympathy for failure to fail is to be disgraced v victis there is something very painful in these races which we english are always running to one who has tenderness enough to think of the nine beaten horses instead of the one who has conquered look at that list which has just come out after our grand national struggle at cambridge how many wranglers are there thirty shall we say and it is always glorious to be a wrangler out of that thirty there is probably but one who has not failed who is not called on to submit to the inward grief of having been beaten the youth who

been green or smith he could have borne it would it not have been better to do as others had done he could have been contented to have gone out in the crowd but there is nothing so base as to be

his lungs into very serious jeopardy it was at oxford in the year that a young man sat in his college rooms at balliol a wretched victim to unsuccessful competition it had been everything to him to

board and shook hands with the captain and officers smiling blandly as they observed the neat trim appearance of the three fine vessels which with everything in readiness for setting sail on the following morning strained at their cables as if anxious to commence their struggle with the waves it is a custom of the directors of the hudson bay company to give a public dinner annually to the officers of their ships upon the eve of their departure from gravesend accordingly one of the gentlemen of the committee before leaving the vessel invited the captain and officers to attend and to my astonishment and delight also begged me to honour them with my company i accepted the invitation with extreme politeness and from inability to express my joy in any other way winked to my friend wiseacre with whom i had become by this time pretty familiar he being also invited winked in return to me and having disposed of this piece of juvenile freemasonry to our satisfaction we assisted the crew in giving three hearty cheers as the little steamer darted from the side and proceeded to the shore the dinner like all other public dinners was as good and substantial as a lavish expenditure of cash could make it but really my recollections of it are very indistinct the ceaseless din of plates glasses knives forks and tongues was tremendous and this together with the novelty of the scene the heat of the room and excellence of the viands tended to render me oblivious of much that took place almost all the faces present were strange to me who were and who were not the gentlemen of the committee was to me matter of the most perfect indifference and as no one took the trouble to address me in particular i confined myself to the interesting occupation of trying to make sense of a conversation held by upwards of fifty pairs of lungs at one and the same time nothing intelligible however was to be heard except when a sudden lull in the noise gave a bald headed old gentleman near the head of the table an opportunity of drinking the health of a red faced old gentleman near the foot upon whom he bestowed an amount of flattery perfectly bewildering and after making the unfortunate red faced gentleman writhe for half an hour in a fever of modesty sat down amid thunders of applause whether the applause by the way was intended for the speaker or the speakee i do not know but being quite indifferent i clapped my hands with the rest the red faced gentleman now purple with excitement then rose and during a solemn silence delivered himself of a speech to the effect that the day then passing was certainly the happiest in his mortal career that he could not find words adequately to express the varied feelings which swelled his throbbing bosom and that he felt quite faint with the mighty load of honour just thrown upon his delighted shoulders by his bald headed friend the red faced gentleman then sat down to the national air of rat tat tat played in full chorus with knives forks spoons nut crackers and knuckles on the polished surface of the mahogany table we left the dinner table at a late hour and after i in company with some other youngsters had done as much mischief as we conveniently could without risking our detention by the strong arm of the law we went down to the beach and embarked in a boat with the captain for the ship how the sailors ever found her in the impenetrable darkness which prevailed all around is a mystery to me to this day find her however they did and in half an hour i was in the land of nod the sun was blazing high in the heavens next morning when i awoke and gazed around for a few moments to discover where i was but the rattling of ropes and blocks the stamping of feet overhead the shouts of gruff voices and above all a certain strange and disagreeable motion in my dormitory soon enlightened me on that point we were going rapidly down the thames with a fair breeze and had actually set sail for the distant shores of hudson bay what took place during the next five or six days i know not the demon of sea sickness had completely prostrated my faculties bodily and mental some faint recollections i have of stormy weather horrible noises and hurried dinners but the greater part of that period is a miserable blank in my memory towards the sixth day however the savoury flavour of a splendid salmon trout floated past my dried up nostrils like afric s spicy gale and caused my collapsed stomach to yearn with strong emotion the ship too was going more quietly through the water and a broad stream of sunshine shot through the small window of my berth penetrated my breast and went down into the centre of my heart filling it with a calm complacent pleasure quite indescribable sounds however of an attack upon the trout roused me and with a mighty effort i tumbled out of bed donned my clothes and seated myself for the first time at the cabin table our party consisted of the captain mr carles a chief factor in the company s service the doctor young mr wiseacre afore mentioned the first and second mates and myself the captain was a thin middle sized offhand man thoroughly acquainted with his profession good humoured and gruff by turns and he always spoke with the air of an oracle mr carles was a mild good natured man of about fifty five with a smooth bald head encircled by a growth of

on purpose by mr henry merrifield said susan at last able to speak don t believe one word david dear hal is laughing at you but how does a pig do it asked david returning to the charge why do you want

upon and she takes in washing and is such a nice woman mamma said we might take them our old winter frocks and so david went there and she said if she had a pig to pay the rent she should be quite happy said david how could he i suppose said miss fosbrook the pig would live on her garden stuff her cabbage leaves and potato skins and that when he was fat she would sell him and pay the rent with the money am i right sam you know i am a cockney you could not be more right if you were a hampshire beg said sam jack higgins was her husband s name and a famous fellow he was he once rigged a little

why shouldn t we give her a pig oh do earnestly exclaimed david i ll catch one broke from john and annie at once such lots as there are in the yard you would catch it i believe said sam disdainfully

crossly don t i can t i ve got something else to do with my money oh you little stingy avaricious crab was the outcry beginning but miss fosbrook stopped it before elizabeth had time to make the angry answer that was rising on her lips no my dears you must not tease her each of you has a full right to use your own money as you may think best and it is not right to force gifts in this manner she s a little affected pussy cat said hal much annoyed i know what she wants it for to buy herself a ridiculous parasol like ida greville when she would see poor hannah higgins starving at her feet elizabeth

without her i ve only sevenpence worse luck that i bought ball of string yesterday the addition amounted to three shillings and elevenpence halfpenny a sum which looked so mighty when spread out chiefly in coppers on the window seat that annie and david looked on it as capable of buying any amount of swine but sam looked rather blank at it and gazing up and down said but what does a pig cost

than any other of his relatives and now will belton was the heir to belton castle for charles amedroz at the age of twenty seven had found the miseries of the world to be too many for him and had put an end to them and to himself charles had been a clever fellow a very clever fellow in the eyes of his father bernard amedroz knew that he himself was not a clever fellow and admired his son accordingly and when charles had been expelled from harrow for some boyish freak in his vengeance against a neighbouring farmer who had reported to the school authorities the doings of a few beagles upon his land charles had cut off the heads of all the trees in a young fir plantation his father was proud of the exploit when he was rusticated a second time from trinity and when the father received an intimation that his son s name had better be taken from the college books the squire was not so well pleased but even then he found some delight in the stories which reached him of his son s vagaries and when the young man commenced bohemian life in london his father did nothing to restrain him then there came the old story debts endless debts and lies endless lies during the two years before his death his father paid for him or undertook to pay nearly ten thousand pounds sacrificing the life assurances which were to have made provision for his daughter sacrificing to a great extent his own life income sacrificing everything so that the property might not be utterly ruined at his death that charles amedroz should be a brighter greater man than any other amedroz had still been the father s pride at the last visit which charles had paid to belton his father had called upon him to pledge himself solemnly that his sister should not be made to suffer by what had been done for him within a month of that time he had blown his brains out in his london lodgings thus making over the entire property to will belton at his father s death at that last pretended settlement with his father and his father s lawyer he had kept back the mention of debts as heavy nearly as those to which he had owned and there were debts of honour too of which he had not spoken trusting to the next event at newmarket to set him right the next event at newmarket had set him more wrong than ever and so there had come an end to everything with charles amedroz this had happened in the spring and the afflicted father afflicted with the double sorrow of his son s terrible death and his daughter s ruin had declared that he would turn his face to the wall and die but the old squire s health though far from strong was stronger than he had deemed it and his feelings sharp enough were less sharp than he had thought them and when a month had passed by he had discovered that it would be better that he should live in order that his daughter might still have bread to eat and a house of her own over her head though he was now an impoverished man there was still left to him the means of keeping up the old home and he told himself that it must if possible be so kept that a few pounds annually might be put by for clara the old carriage horses were sold and the park was let to a farmer up to the hall door of the castle so much the squire could do but as to the putting by of the few pounds any dependence on such exertion as that on his part would we may say be very precarious belton castle was not in truth a castle immediately before the front door so near to the house as merely to allow of a broad road running between it and the entrance porch there stood an old tower which gave its name to the residence an old square tower up which the amedroz boys for three generations had been able to climb by means of the ivy and broken stones in one of the inner corners and this tower was a remnant of a real castle that had once protected the village of belton the house itself was an ugly residence three stories high built in the time of george ii with low rooms and long passages and an immense number of doors it was a large unattractive house unattractive that is as regarded its own attributes but made interesting by the beauty of the small park in which it stood belton park did not perhaps contain much above a hundred acres but the land was so broken into knolls and valleys in so many places was the rock seen to be cropping up through the verdure there were in it so many stunted old oaks so many points of vantage for the lover of scenery that no one would believe it to be other than a considerable domain the farmer who took it and who would not under any circumstances undertake to pay more than seventeen shillings an acre for it could not be made to think that it was in any way considerable but belton park since first it was made a park had never before been regarded after this fashion farmer stovey of the grange was the first man of that class who had ever assumed the right to pasture his sheep in belton chase as the people around were still accustomed to call the woodlands of the estate it was full summer at belton and four months had now passed since the dreadful tidings had reached the castle it was full summer and the people of the village were again going about their ordinary business and the shop girls with their lovers from redicote were again to be seen walking among the oaks in the park on a sunday evening and the world in that district of somersetshire was getting itself back into its grooves the fate of the young heir had disturbed the grooves greatly and had taught many in those parts to feel that the world was coming to an end

archdeacon their own private knowledge that the ministry must fall within five days the son returned to his father s room and after administering with his own hands the sustaining modicum of madeira sat down by the bedside to calculate his chances the ministry were to be out within five days his father was to be dead within no he rejected that view of the subject the ministry were to be out and the diocese might probably be vacant at the same period there was much doubt as to the names of the men who were to succeed to power and a week must elapse before a cabinet was formed would not vacancies be filled by the outgoing men during this week dr grantly had a kind of idea that such would be the case but did not know and then he wondered at his own ignorance on such a question he tried to keep his mind away from the subject but he could not the race was so very close and the stakes were so very high he then looked at the dying man s impassive placid face there was no sign there of death or disease it was something thinner than of yore somewhat grayer and the deep lines of age more marked but as far as he could judge life might yet hang there for weeks to come sir lamda mewnew and sir omicron pie had thrice been wrong and might yet be wrong thrice again the old bishop slept during twenty of the twenty four hours but during the short periods of his waking moments he knew both his son and his dear old friend mr harding the archdeacon s father in law and would thank them tenderly for their care and love now he lay sleeping like a baby resting easily on his back his mouth just open and his few gray hairs straggling from beneath his cap his breath was perfectly noiseless and his thin wan hand which lay above the coverlid never moved nothing could be easier than the old man s passage from this world to the next but by no means easy were the emotions of him who sat there watching he knew it must be now or never he was already over fifty and there was little chance that his friends who were now leaving office would soon return to it no probable british prime minister but he who was now in he who was so soon to be out would think of making a bishop of dr grantly thus he thought long and sadly in deep silence and then gazed at that still living face and then at last dared to ask himself whether he really longed for his father s death the effort was a salutary one and the question was answered in a moment the proud wishful worldly man sank on his knees by the bedside and taking the bishop s hand within his own prayed eagerly that his sins might be forgiven him his face was still buried in the clothes when the door of the bedroom opened noiselessly and mr harding entered with a velvet step mr harding s attendance at that bedside had been nearly as constant as that of the archdeacon and his ingress and egress was as much a matter of course as that of his son in law he was standing close beside the archdeacon before he was perceived and would also have knelt in prayer had he not feared that his doing so might have caused some sudden start and have disturbed the dying man dr grantly however instantly perceived him and rose from his knees as he did so mr harding took both his hands and pressed them warmly there was more fellowship between them at that moment than there had ever been before and it so happened that after circumstances greatly preserved the feeling as they stood there pressing each other s hands the tears rolled freely down their cheeks god bless you my dears said the bishop with feeble voice as he woke god bless you may god bless you both my dear children and so he died there was no loud rattle in the throat no dreadful struggle no palpable sign of death but the lower jaw fell a little from its place and the eyes which had been so constantly closed in sleep now remained fixed and open neither mr harding nor dr grantly knew that life was gone though both suspected it i believe it s all over said mr harding still pressing the other s hands i think nay i hope it is i will ring the bell said the other speaking all but in a whisper mrs phillips should be here mrs phillips the nurse was soon in the room and immediately with practised hand closed those staring eyes it s all over mrs phillips asked mr harding my lord s no more said mrs phillips turning round and curtseying low with solemn face his lordship s gone more like a sleeping babby than any that i ever saw it s a great relief archdeacon said mr harding a great relief dear good excellent old man oh that our last moments may be as innocent and as peaceful as his surely said mrs phillips the lord be praised for all his mercies but for a meek mild gentle spoken christian his lordship was and mrs phillips with unaffected but easy grief put up her white apron to her flowing eyes you cannot but rejoice that it is over said mr harding still consoling his friend the archdeacon s mind however had already travelled from the death chamber to the closet of the prime minister he had brought himself to pray for his father s life but now that that life was done minutes were too precious to be lost it was now useless to dally with the fact of the bishop s death useless to lose perhaps everything for the pretence of a foolish sentiment but how was he to act while his father in law stood there holding his hand how without appearing unfeeling was he to forget his father in the bishop to overlook what he had lost and think only of what he might possibly gain no i suppose not said he at last in answer to mr harding we have all expected it so long mr harding took him by the arm and led him from the room we will see him again to morrow morni,2

plain and even if attainable what would you do upon that lofty clouded summit or how can you hope to breathe that rarefied air unfitted for your human lungs true my lord said babbalanja and bardianna asserts that the plain alone was intended for man who should be content to dwell under the shade of its groves though the roots thereof descend into the darkness of the earth but my lord you well know that there are those in mardi who secretly regard all stories connected with this peak as inventions of the people of maramma they deny that any thing is to be gained by making a pilgrimage thereto and for warranty they appeal to the sayings of the great prophet alma cried mohi but alma is also quoted by others in vindication of the pilgrimages to ofo they declare that the prophet himself was the first pilgrim that thitherward journeyed that from thence he departed to the skies now excepting this same peak maramma is all rolling hill and dale like the sea after a storm which then seems not to roll but to stand still poising its mountains yet the landscape of maramma has not the merriness of meadows partly because of the shadow of ofo and partly because of the solemn groves in which the morais and temples are buried according to mohi not one solitary tree bearing fruit not one esculent root grows in all the isle the population wholly depending upon the large tribute remitted from the neighboring shores it is not that the soil is unproductive said mohi that these things are so it is extremely fertile but the inhabitants say that it would be wrong to make a bread fruit orchard of the holy island and hence my lord said babbalanja while others are charged with the business of their temporal welfare these islanders take no thought of the morrow and broad maramma lies one fertile waste in the lagoon chapter ii they land coming close to the island the pennons and trappings of our canoes were removed and vee vee was commanded to descend from the shark s mouth and for a time to lay aside his conch in token of reverence our paddlers also stripped to the waist an example which even media followed though as a king the same homage he rendered was at times rendered himself at every place hitherto visited joyous crowds stood ready to hail our arrival but the shores of maramma were silent and forlorn said babbalanja it looks not as if the lost one were here at length we landed in a little cove nigh a valley which mohi called uma and here in silence we beached our canoes but presently there came to us an old man with a beard white as the mane of the pale horse he was clad in a midnight robe he fanned himself with a fan of faded leaves a child led him by the hand for he was blind wearing a green plantain leaf over his plaited brow him media accosted making mention who we were and on what errand we came to seek out yillah and behold the isle whereupon pani for such was his name gave us a courteous reception and lavishly promised to discover sweet yillah declaring that in maramma if any where the long lost maiden must be found he assured us that throughout the whole land he would lead us leaving no place desirable to be searched unexplored and so saying he conducted us to his dwelling for refreshment and repose it was large and lofty near by however were many miserable hovels with squalid inmates but the old man s retreat was exceedingly comfortable especially abounding in mats for lounging his rafters were bowed down by calabashes of good cheer during the repast which ensued blind pani freely partaking enlarged upon the merit of abstinence declaring that a thatch overhead and a cocoanut tree comprised all that was necessary for the temporal welfare of a mardian more than this he assured us was sinful he now made known that he officiated as guide in this quarter of the country and that as he had renounced all other pursuits to devote himself to showing strangers the island and more particularly the best way to ascend lofty ofo he was necessitated to seek remuneration for his toil my lord then whispered mohi to media the great prophet alma always declared that without charge this island was free to all what recompense do you desire old man said media to path what i seek is but little twenty rolls of fine tappa two score mats of best upland grass one canoe load of bread fruit and yams ten gourds of wine and forty strings of teeth you are a large company but my requisitions are small very small said mohi you are extortionate good pani said media and what wants an aged mortal like you with all these things i thought superfluities were worthless nay sinful said babbalanja is not this your habitation already more than abundantly supplied with all desirable furnishings asked yoomy i am but a lowly laborer said the old man meekly crossing his arms but does not the lowliest laborer ask and receive his reward and shall i miss mine but i beg charity of none what i ask i demand and in the dread name of great alma who appointed me a guide and to and fro he strode groping as he went marking his blindness whispered babbalanja to media my lord methinks this pani must be a poor guide in his journeys

most entire abandonment to grief carefully dressed and with no hint at invalidism but the chair he bore himself as easily and calmly as if the doom of lifelong helplessness did not hang over him a single motion of the hand sent him rolling noiselessly to the curtained door but as he did so a voice exclaimed behind him wait for me cousin and as he turned a young girl approached smiling a glad welcome as she took his hand adding in a tone of soft reproach home again and not let me know it till i heard the good news by accident was it good news octavia and maurice looked up at the frank face

martyrdom so crippled and confined if it last long he will go mad or die general and mrs snowden announced the servant and a sudden pause ensued as everyone looked up to greet the newcomers a feeble white haired old man entered leaning on the arm of an indescribably beautiful woman not thirty yet tall and nobly molded with straight black brows over magnificent eyes rippling dark hair gathered up in a great knot and ornamented with a single band of gold a sweeping dress of wine colored velvet set off with a dazzling neck and arms decorated like her stately head with ornaments of roman gold at

her to wear appeared the anguish of a strong willed woman burdened by a heavy cross no one would dare express pity or offer sympathy for her whole air repelled it and in her gloomy eyes sat scorn of

latter sparingly but they will not have imbued her with that hope for some transcendental paradise of affection which so often fills and exalts the hearts of our daughters here at home she is moderate in her aspirations requiring less excitement than an english girl and never forgetting the solid necessities of life as they are so often forgotten here in england in associating with young men an english girl will always remember that in each one she so meets she may find an admirer whom she may possibly love or an admirer whom she may probably be called on to repel she is ever conscious of the fact of this position and a romance is thus engendered which if it may at times be dangerous is at any rate always charming but the german girl in her simplicity has no such consciousness as you and i my reader might probably become dear friends were we to meet and know each other so may the german girl learn to love the fair haired youth with whom chance has for a time associated her but to her mind there occurs no suggestive reason why it should be so no probability that the youth may regard her in such light because that chance has come to pass she can therefore give him her hand without trepidation and talk with him for half an hour when called on to do so as calmly as she might do with his sister such a one was isa heine at the time of which i am writing we english in our passion for daily excitement might call her phlegmatic but we should call her so unjustly life to her was a serious matter of which the daily duties and daily wants were sufficient to occupy her thoughts she was her mother s companion the instructress of both her brother and her sister and the charm of her father s vacant hours with such calls upon her time and so many realities around her her imagination did not teach her to look for joys beyond those of her present life and home when love and marriage should come to her as come they probably might she would endeavour to attune herself to a new happiness and a new sphere of duties in the meantime she was contented to keep her mother s accounts and look after her brother and sister up two pair of stairs in the ludwigs strasse but change would certainly come we may prophesy for isa heine was a beautiful girl tall and graceful comely to the eye and fit in every way to be loved and cherished as the partner of a man s home i have said that an english clerk made a part of that small establishment in the dingy banking office in the schrannen platz and i must say a word or two of herbert onslow in his early career he had not been fortunate his father with means sufficiently moderate and with a family more than sufficiently large had sent him to a public school at which he had been very idle and then to one of the universities at which he had run into debt and had therefore left without a degree when this occurred a family council of war had been held among the onslows and it was decided that herbert should be sent off to the banking house of heines at munich there being a cousinship between the families and some existing connections of business it was therefore so settled and herbert willing enough to see the world as he considered he should do by going to munich started for his german home with injunctions very tender from his mother and very solemn from his aggrieved father but there was nothing bad at the heart about young onslow and if the solemn father had well considered it he might perhaps have felt that those debts at cambridge reflected more fault on him than on his son when herbert arrived at munich his cousins the heines far away cousins though they were behaved kindly to him they established him at first in lodgings where he was boarded with many others having heard somewhat of his early youth but when madame heine at the end of twelve months perceived that he was punctual at the bank and that his allowances which though moderate in england were handsome in munich carried him on without debt she opened her motherly arms and suggested to his mother and to himself that he should live with them in this way he also was domiciled up two pairs of stairs in the palatial residence in the ludwigs strasse but all this happened long ago isa heine had been only seventeen when her cousin had first come to munich and had made acquaintance with him rather as a child than as a woman and when as she ripened into womanhood this young man came more closely among them it did not strike her that the change would affect her more powerfully than it would the others her uncle and father she knew had approved of herbert at the bank and herbert had shown that he could be steady therefore he was to be taken into their family paying his annual subsidy instead of being left with strangers at the boarding house all this was very simple to her she assisted in mending his linen as she did her father s she visited his room daily as she visited all the others she took notice of his likings and dislikings as touching their table arrangement but by no means such notice as she did of her father s and without any flutter inwardly in her imagination or outwardly as regarded the world she made him one of the family so things went on for a year nay so things went on for two years with her after herbert onslow had come to the ludwigs strasse but the matter had been regarded in a very different light by herbert himself when the proposition had been made to him his first idea had been that so close a connection with a girl so very pretty would be delightful he had blushed as he had given in his adhesion but madame heine when she saw the blush had attributed it to anything but the true cause when isa had asked him as to his wants,2

becoming solicitor general at fifty and ceasing to hold that much desired office four months after his appointment such cessation however arising from political causes is no disappointment to a man it will doubtless be the case that a man so placed will regret the weakness of his party which has been unable to keep the good things of government in its hands but he will recognise without remorse or sorrow the fact that the ministry to which he has attached himself must cease to be a ministry and there will be nothing in his displacement to gall his pride or to create that inner feeling of almost insupportable mortification which comes from the conviction of personal failure sir thomas underwood had been solicitor general for a few months under a conservative prime minister and when the conservative minister went out of office sir thomas underwood followed him with no feeling of regret that caused him unhappiness but when afterwards the same party came back to power and he having lost his election at the borough which he had represented was passed over without a word of sympathy or even of assumed regret from the minister then he was wounded it was true he knew that a man to be solicitor general should have a seat in parliament the highest legal offices in the country are not to be attained by any amount of professional excellence unless the candidate shall have added to such excellence the power of supporting a ministry and a party in the house of commons sir thomas underwood thoroughly understood this but he knew also that there are various ways in which a lame dog may be helped over a stile if only the lame dog be popular among dogs for another ex solicitor general a seat would have been found or some delay would have been granted or at least there would have been a consultation with a suggestion that something should be tried but in this case a man four years his junior in age whom he despised and who as he was informed had obtained his place in parliament by gross bribery was put into the office without a word of apology to him then he was unhappy and acknowledged to himself that his spirit was crushed but he acknowledged to himself at the same time that he was one doomed by his nature to such crushing of the spirit if he came out of the hole of his solitude and endeavoured to carry on the open fight of life among his fellow men he knew that he was one doomed to that disappointment the bitterest of all which comes from failure when the prize has been all but reached it is much to have become solicitor general and that he had achieved but it is worse than nothing to have been solicitor general for four months and then to find that all the world around one regards one as having failed and as being therefore fit for the shelf such were sir thomas underwood s feelings as he sat alone in his chambers during those days in which the new administration was formed in which days he was neither consulted nor visited nor communicated with either by message or by letter but all this this formation of a ministry in which the late solicitor general was not invited to take a part occurred seven years before the commencement of our story during those years in which our lawyer sat in parliament as mr underwood at which time he was working hard also as a chancery barrister and was perhaps nearer to his fellow men than he had ever been before or was ever destined to be afterwards he resided as regarded himself almost nominally at a small but pretty villa which he had taken for his wife s sake at fulham it was close upon the river and had well arranged though not extensive shrubbery walks and a little lawn and a tiny conservatory and a charming opening down to the thames mrs underwood had found herself unable to live in half moon street and mr underwood not unwillingly had removed his household gods to this retreat at that time his household gods consisted of a wife and two daughters but the wife had died before the time came at which she could have taken on herself the name of lady underwood the villa at fulham was still kept and there lived the two girls and there also sir thomas had he been interrogated on the subject would have declared that he also was domiciled but if a man lives at the place in which he most often sleeps sir thomas in truth lived at his chambers at southampton buildings when he moved those household gods of his to the villa it was necessary because of his duties in parliament that he should have some place in town wherein he might lay his head and therefore i fear not unwillingly he took to laying his head very frequently in the little bedroom which was attached to his chambers it is not necessary that we should go back to any feelings which might have operated upon him during his wife s lifetime or during the period of his parliamentary career his wife was now dead and he no longer held a seat in parliament he had indeed all but abandoned his practice at the bar never putting himself forward for the ordinary business of a chancery barrister but nevertheless he spent the largest half of his life in his chambers breakfasting there reading there writing there and sleeping there he did not altogether desert the lodge at fulham and the two girls who lived there he would not even admit to them or allow them to assert that he had not his home with them sometimes for two nights together and sometimes for three he would be at the villa never remaining there however during the day but on sundays it may almost be said that he was never at home and hence arose the feeling that of all this went the nearest to create discord between the father and the daughters sir thomas was always in southampton buildings on sundays did sir thomas go to church the miss underwoods did,2

of the same sex were of a different character if women can ever be ugly certainly these three ladies might put in a valid claim to that epithet their complexions were dark and withered and their eyes

her flower pot it was about six inches high the sight of this orange tree interested marco very much for it reminded him of home he had often seen orange trees growing in the parlors and green houses in new york what a pretty little orange tree said marco where did you get it how did you know it was an orange tree said the girl o i know an orange tree well enough replied marco i have seen them many a time where asked the girl in new york said marco did your orange tree come from new york no said the girl i planted an orange seed and it grew from that i ve got a lemon tree too she added but it is a great deal larger the lemon tree grows faster than the orange my lemon tree is so large that i couldn t bring it home very well so i left it in the mill in the mill said marco are you a miller the girl laughed she was a very good humored girl and did not appear to be displeased though it certainly was not quite proper for marco to speak in that manner to a stranger she did not however reply to his question but said after a pause do you know where the montpelier stage is the proper english meaning of the word stage is a portion of the road traveled between one resting place and another but in the united states it is used to mean the carriage being a sort of contraction for stage coach no said marco we are going in that stage i wish it would come along said the girl for i m tired of watching my trunk where is your trunk said marco so the girl pointed out her trunk it was upon the platform of the piazza near those belonging to forester and marco the girl showed marco her name which was mary williams written on a card upon the end of it i ll watch your trunk said marco and you can go in and sit down until the stage comes mary thanked him and went in she was not however quite sure that her baggage was safe intrusted thus to the charge of a strange boy and so she took a seat near the window where she could keep an eye upon it there was a blue chest near these trunks which looked like a sailor s chest and marco being tired of standing sat down upon this chest he had however scarcely taken his seat when he saw a coach with four horses coming round a corner it was driven by a small boy not larger than marco it wheeled up toward the door and came to a stand some men then put on the sailor s chest and the trunks mary williams came out and got into the coach she sat on the back seat forester and marco got in and took their places on the middle seat a young man dressed like a sailor took the front seat at one corner of the coach these were all the passengers that were to get in here when every thing was ready they drove away the stage stopped however in a few minutes at the door of a handsome house in the town and took a gentleman and lady in these new passengers took places on the back seat with mary williams this company rode in perfect silence for some time forester took out a book and began to read the gentleman on the back seat went to sleep mary williams and marco looked out at the windows watching the changing scenery the sailor rode in silence moving his lips now and then as if he were talking to himself but taking no notice of any of the company the coach stopped at the villages which they passed through to exchange the mail and sometimes to take in new passengers in the course of these changes marco got his place shifted to the forward seat by the side of the sailor and he gradually got into conversation with him marco introduced the conversation by asking the sailor if he knew how far it was to montpelier no said the sailor i don t keep any reckoning but i wish we were there why asked marco o i expect the old cart will capsize somewhere among these mountains and break our necks for us marco had observed all the morning that when the coach canted to one side or the other on account of the unevenness of the road the sailor always started and looked anxious as if afraid it was going to be upset he wondered that a man who had been apparently accustomed to the terrible dangers of the seas should be alarmed at the gentle oscillations of a stage coach are you afraid that we shall upset asked marco yes said the sailor over some of these precipices and mountains and then there ll be an end of us the sailor said this in an easy and careless manner as if after all he was not much concerned about the danger still marco was surprised that he should fear it at all he was not aware how much the fears which people feel are occasioned by the mere novelty of the danger which they incur a stage driver who is calm and composed on his box in a dark night and upon dangerous roads will be alarmed by the careening of a ship under a gentle breeze at sea while the sailor who laughs at a gale of wind on the ocean is afraid to ride in a carriage on land an t you a sailor asked marco yes replied his companion i shouldn t think that a man that had been used to the sea would be afraid of upsetting in a coach i m not

mosaics that the whole world flock there to see them people go there chiefly in the winter at that season the town is crowded with strangers a great many people too go there in the winter to avoid the cold weather which prevails at that time of the year in all the more northerly countries of europe there is so little winter in florence that few of the houses have any fireplaces in them except in the kitchen when there comes a cold day the people warm themselves by means of a jug or jar of earthen ware with a handle passing over across the top by which they carry it about they fill these jars half full of hot embers and so carry them with them wherever they want to go the women when they sit down put the jar under their dresses on the floor or pavement beneath them and the men place it right before them between their feet you will see market women and flower girls sitting in the corners of the streets in the winter attending to their business and keeping themselves warm all the time with these little fire jars and artists in the palaces and picture galleries each with one of them by his side or close before him while he is at work copying the works of the great masters or making drawings from the antique statues there is another very curious use that the people of florence make of these jars and that is they warm the beds with them when any body is sick so as to require this indulgence you would think it very difficult to warm a bed with an open jar filled with burning embers the way they do it is this they hang the jar in the inside of a sort of wooden cage shaped like a bushel basket and about as large they turn this cage upside down and hang the jar up in it by means of a hook depending inside they turn down the bed clothes and put the cage in it jar of coals and all they then put back the bed clothes and cover the cage all up they leave it so for a quarter of an hour and then carefully turning the clothes down again they take the jar out and the bed is warmed but to return to mr george and rollo they engaged a vetturino for the first time at florence mr george had gone to florence chiefly for the purpose of examining the immense collections of paintings and statuary which exist there rollo went not on account of the paintings or statues for he did not care much about such things but because he liked to go any where where he could see new places and be entertained by new scenes accordingly while mr george was at work in the galleries of florence studying by the help of catalogues the famous specimens of ancient art rollo was usually rambling about the streets observing the manners and customs of the people and watching the singular and curious scenes that every where met his eye the reason why there are so many paintings and sculptures in italy is this in the middle ages it was the fashion in all the central parts of europe for the people to spend almost all their surplus money in building and decorating churches indeed there was then very little else that they could do at the present time people invest their funds as fast as they accumulate them in building ships and railroads docks for the storage of merchandise houses and stores in cities to let for the sake of the rent and country seats or pretty private residences of various kinds for themselves but in the middle ages very little could be done in the way of investments like these there were no railroads and there was very little use for ships there was no profit to be gained by building houses and stores for there were so many wars and commotions among the people of the different towns and kingdoms that nothing was stable or safe for the same reason it was useless for men to spend their money in building and ornamenting their own houses for at the first approach of an enemy the town in which they lived was likely to be sacked and their houses and all the fine furniture which they might contain would be burned or destroyed but the churches were safe the people of the different countries had so much veneration for sacred places and for every thing connected with religion that they were afraid to touch or injure any thing that had been consecrated to a religious use to plunder a church or a convent or an abbey or to do any thing to injure or destroy the property that they contained was regarded as sacrilege and sacrilege they deemed a dreadful crime abhorred by god and man thus while they would burn and destroy hundreds of dwellings without any remorse and turn the wretched inmates out at midnight into the streets to die of exposure terror and despair they would stop at once when they came to the church afraid to harm it in any way or to touch the least thing that it contained accordingly while every thing else in a conquered town was doomed to the most reckless destruction all that was in the church the most delicate paintings and the most costly gold and silver images and utensils were as safe as if they were surrounded by impregnable castle walls of course these notions were very mistaken ones according to the teachings of our lord and saviour jesus christ it must be a greater sin to burn down the cottage of a poor widow and turn her out at midnight into the streets to die than to plunder for gain the richest altar in the world from these and various other similar causes it happened that in the middle ages that is from five hundred to a thousand years ago almost all the great expenditures of money in all the great cities and towns of europe were made for churches sometimes these churches were so lar,2

is quite difficult to drop the pail in such a manner as to get any water when the vessel is under way i should like to try said marco you can find out whether the water is salt easier than that said forester you can let a twine string down and wet the end that will take up enough for a taste well said marco if i ve got a string long enough so saying he began to feel in his pockets for a string he found a piece of twine which he thought would be long enough but on trial it appeared that it would not reach quite to the water forester then tied it to the end of his cane and allowed marco to take the cane and hold it over the side of the vessel and by this means he succeeded in reaching the water and wetting the end of the string he could after all succeed in wetting only a small part of the string for it was drawn along so rapidly by the motion of the boat that it skipped upon the surface of the water without sinking in at length however after he had got the end a little wetted he drew it up and put it in his mouth how does it taste said forester the question was hardly necessary for the faces which marco made showed sufficiently plain that the water was bitter and salt yes it is salt said he then suddenly casting his eye upon a long dark looking substance which just then came floating by he called out why forester what is that a log said forester the log was round and straight and the ends were square the log glided rapidly by and soon disappeared it is a pine log said forester there are vast forests of pine trees in this state they cut down the trees and then cut the trunks into pieces of moderate length and draw them on the snow to the rivers then in the spring the waters rise and float the logs down this is one of these logs floating down sometimes the river is quite full of them where do they go asked marco oh men stop them all along the river and put them into booms and then fasten them together in rafts how do they fasten them together asked marco they drive a pin into the middle of each log and then extend a rope along fastening it to each pin in this manner the rope holds the logs together and they form a long raft when they catch the logs in booms they afterwards form them into rafts and so float them down the river to the mills where they are to be sawed can men stand upon the rafts said marco yes replied forester very well they make a floor of boards i suppose said marco no replied forester they stand directly upon the logs i should think the logs would sink under them replied marco or at least roll about they sink a little replied forester just about as much as the bulk of the man who stands upon them i don t know what you mean by that exactly said marco why the rule of floating bodies is this rejoined forester when any substance like a cake of ice or a log of wood or a boat is floating upon the water a part of it being above the water and a part under the water if a man steps upon it he makes it sink enough deeper to submerge a part of the wood or ice as large as he is himself if there is just as much of the wood or ice above the water as is equal to the bulk of the man then the man in stepping upon it will sink it just to the water s edge but perhaps one man would be heavier than another man said marco yes replied forester but then he would be larger and so according to the principle he would make more wood sink before the equilibrium was reached what is equilibrium asked marco equilibrium is an equality between two forces replied forester i don t see what two forces there are said marco there is the weight of the man pressing downwards said forester for one and the buoyant power of the water that is its upward pressure for the other the weight of the man remains constantly the same but the upward pressure of the water increases in proportion as the log sinks into it for the deeper the log sinks into the water the more of it is submerged and it is more acted upon and pressed upward by the water now as one of these forces remains constant and the other increases they must at length come to be equal that is in equilibrium and then the log will not sink any farther that s the philosophy of it marco marco did not reply but sat looking at the barren and rocky shores of the river as the boat glided by them presently another log came into view there said forester look at that log and see whether you think that you could float upon it yes said marco i think i could it depends said forester on the question whether the part of it which is out of water is as big as you are i think it is said marco yes added forester i have no doubt that it is only i should roll off said marco true replied forester but the millmen who work about the logs acquire astonishing dexterity in standing upon them if there is only enough of the log above water to equal their bulk so that it has buoyant power enough to float them they will keep it steady with their feet and sail about upon it very safely i should like to try said marco perhaps we shall have an opportunity at some place on the river said forester here marco suddenly interrupted the conversation by pointing up the river to a column of smoke and steam which he saw rising beyond a point of land which was just before them here comes another steamboat said he see forester no said forester i believe that is a steam mill a

foregoing prediction may seem the facts of the last half century will we think justify it if the manhattan towns or manhattan as we shall not scruple to term the several places that compose the prosperous sisterhood at the mouth of the hudson a name that is more ancient and better adapted to the history associations and convenience of the place than any other continue to prosper as they have done ere the close of the present century they will take their station among the capitals of the first rank it may require a longer period to collect the accessories of a first class place for these are the products of time and cultivation though the facilities of intercourse the spirit of the age and the equalizing sentiment that marks the civilization of the epoch will greatly hasten everything in the shape of improvement new york will probably never possess any churches of an architecture to attract attention for their magnitude and magnificence the policy of the country which separates religion from the state precludes this by confining all the expenditures of this nature to the several parishes few of which are rich enough to do more than erect edifices of moderate dimensions and cost the romish church so much addicted to addressing the senses manifests some desire to construct its cathedrals but they are necessarily confined to the limits and ornaments suited to the resources of a branch of the church that in this country is by no means affluent the manner in which the americans are subdivided into sects also conflicts with any commendable desire that may exist to build glorious temples in honor of the deity and convenience is more consulted than taste perhaps in all that relates to ecclesiastical architecture nevertheless a sensible improvement in this respect has occurred within the last few years to which we shall elsewhere advert it will be in their trade their resources their activity and their influence on the rest of the world as well as in their population that the towns of manhattan will be first entitled to rank with the larger capitals of europe so obvious rapid and natural has been the advance of all the places that it is not easy for the mind to regard anything belonging to them as extraordinary or out of rule there is not a port in the whole country that is less indebted to art and the fostering hand of government than this it is true certain forts most of them of very doubtful necessity have been constructed for defence but no attack having ever been contemplated or if contemplated attempted they have been dead letters in the history of its progress we are not aware that government has ever expended one cent in the waters of manhattan except for the surveys construction of the aforesaid military works and the erection of the lighthouses that form a part of the general provision for the safe navigation of the entire coast some money has been expended for the improvement of the shallow waters of the hudson but it has been as much or more for the advantage of the upper towns and the trade coastwise generally than for the special benefit of new york the immense natural advantages of the bays and islands at the mouth of the hudson have in a great degree superseded the necessity of such assistance nature has made every material provision for a mart of the first importance and perhaps it has been fortunate that the towns have been left like healthful and vigorous children managed by prudent parents to take the inclination and growth pointed out to them by this safest and best of guides london is indebted to artificial causes in a great degree for its growth and power that great law of trade which renders settling places indispensable has contributed to her prosperity and continued ascendency long after the day when rival ports are carrying away her fleets and commerce she is a proof of the difficulty of shaking a commercial superiority long established scarce a cargo that enters the ports of the kingdom that does not pay tribute to her bankers or merchants but london is a political capital and that in a country where the representation of the government is more imposing possessing greater influence than in any other christian nation the english aristocracy which wields the real authority of the state here makes its annual exhibition of luxury and wealth such as the world has never beheld anywhere else ancient rome possibly excepted and has had a large share in rendering london what it is new york has none of this adventitious aid both of the governments that of the united states and that of the state have long been taken from her leaving her nothing of this sort but her own local authorities but representation forms no part of the machinery of american policy it is supposed that man is too intellectual and philosophical to need it in this intellectual and philosophical country par excellence although such is the theory the whole struggle in private life is limited to the impression made by representation in the hands of individuals that which the government has improvidently cast aside society has seized upon and hundreds who have no claim to distinction beyond the possession of money profit by the mistake to place themselves in positions perhaps that they are not always exactly qualified to fill of all social usurpations that of mere money is the least tolerable as one may have a very full purse with empty brains and vulgar tastes and habits the wisdom of thus throwing the control of a feature of society that is of much more moment than is commonly supposed into the chapter of commercial accidents may well he questioned some crude attempts have been made to bring the circles of new york within the control of a code

means of acquitting myself both of my duty and obligation to my departed friend what kinder office lies in me to do to these his most valuable and imperishable remains than to commit them to the

should tire your grace with reiterated praises and acknowledgments and i might possibly notwithstanding my pretended right so to do give some handle to such who are inclinable to censure to tax me of affectation and officiousness in thanking you more than comes to my share for doing a thing which is in truth of a public consideration as it is doing an honour to your country for so unquestionably it is to do honour to him who was an honour to it i have but one thing to say either to obviate or to answer such an objection if it shall be made to me which is that i loved mr dryden i have not touched upon any other public honour or bounty done by you to your country i have industriously declined entering upon a theme of so extensive a nature and of all your numerous and continual largesses to the public i have only singled out this as what most particularly affected me i confess freely to your grace i very much admire all those other donations but i much more love this and i cannot help it if i am naturally more delighted with any thing that is amiable than with any thing that is wonderful whoever shall censure me i dare be confident you my lord will excuse me for any thing that i shall say with due regard to a gentleman for whose person i had as just an affection as i have an admiration of his writings and indeed mr dryden had personal qualities to challenge both love and esteem from all who were truly acquainted with him he was of a nature exceedingly humane and compassionate easily forgiving injuries and capable of a prompt and sincere reconciliation with them who had offended him such a temperament is the only solid foundation of all moral virtues and sociable endowments his friendship where he professed it went much beyond his professions and i have been told of strong and generous instances of it by the persons themselves who received them though his hereditary income was little more than a bare competency as his reading had been very extensive so was he very happy in a memory tenacious of every thing that he had read he was not more possessed of knowledge than he was communicative of it but then his communication of it was by no means pedantic or imposed upon the conversation but just such and went so far as by the natural turns of the discourse in which he was engaged it was necessarily promoted or required he was extreme ready and gentle in his correction of the errors of any writer who thought fit to consult him and full as ready and patient to admit of the reprehension of others in respect of his own oversight or mistakes he was of very easy i may say of very pleasing access but something slow and as it were diffident in his advances to others he had something in his nature that abhorred intrusion into any society whatsoever indeed it is to be regretted that he was rather blameable in the other extreme for by that means he was personally less known and consequently his character might become liable both to misapprehensions and misrepresentations to the best of my knowledge and observation he was of all the men that ever i knew one of the most modest and the most easily to be discountenanced in his approaches either to his superiors or his equals i have given your grace this slight sketch of his personal character as well to vindicate his memory as to justify myself for the love which i bore to his person and i have the rather done it because i hope it may be acceptable to you to know that he was worthy of the distinction you have shewn him as a man as well as an author as to his writings i shall not take upon me to speak of them for to say little of them would not be to do them right and to say all that i ought to say would be to be very voluminous but i may venture to say in general terms that no man hath written in our language so much and so various matter and in so various manners so well another thing i may say very peculiar to him which is that his parts did not decline with his years but that he was an improving writer to his last even to near seventy years of age improving even in fire and imagination as well as in judgment witness his ode on st cecilia s day and his fables his latest performances he was equally excellent in verse and in prose his prose had all the clearness imaginable together with all the nobleness of expression all the graces and ornaments proper and peculiar to it without deviating into the language or diction of poetry i make this observation only to distinguish his style from that of many poetical writers who meaning to write har,1

the english monarchy known through all the world as westminster abbey after a time when england became at length one kingdom the king built his palace and established his parliament and opened his court in westminster not far from the abbey the place being about three miles from the city was very convenient for this purpose in process of time public edifices were erected and noblemen s houses and new palaces for the king or for other members of the royal family were built and shops were set up for the sale of such things as the people of the court might wish to buy and streets and squares were laid out and in fine westminster became gradually quite an extended and famous town it was still however entirely distinct from london being about three miles from it farther up the river the principal road from london to westminster followed the margin of the water and was called the strand towards westminster the road diverged from the river so as to leave a space between wide enough for houses and along this space the great nobles from time to time built magnificent palaces around great square courts where they could ride in under an archway the fronts of these palaces were towards the road and there were gardens behind them leading down to the water at the foot of the garden there was usually a boat house and a landing where the people who lived in the palace or their friends could embark on board boats for excursions on the thames in the mean time while westminster was thus becoming a large and important town london itself three miles farther down the river was also constantly growing too in its own way as a town of merchants and artisans other villages too began to spring up in every direction around these great centres and london and westminster gradually spreading finally met each other and then extending on each side gradually swallowed up these villages until now the whole region for five or six miles in every direction from the original centres forms one mighty mass of streets squares lanes courts terraces all crowded with edifices and thronged with population in this mass all visible distinction between the several villages which have been swallowed up is entirely lost though the two original centres remain as widely separated and as distinct as ever the primeval london has however lost its exclusive right to its name and is now simply called the city and in the same manner westminster is called the west end and sometimes the town while the name london is used to denote the whole of the vast conglomeration which envelops and includes the two original capitals the city and the west end though thus swallowed as it were in the general metropolis are still entirely distinct they are in fact in some respects even more widely distinct from each other now than ever each is in its own way at the head of its class of cities the city is the greatest and wealthiest mart of commerce in the world while the west end is the seat and centre of the proudest and most extended political and military power in fact the commercial organization which centres in the city and the military one which has its head quarters around the throne at the west end are probably the greatest and most powerful organizations each of its kind that the world has ever known mr george explained all this to rollo as they walked together away from the london bridge station where the train in which they came in from the south stopped when it reached london but i will give a more detailed account of their conversation in the next chapter chapter ii london bridge when the train stopped at what is called the london bridge station the passengers all stepped out of their respective cars upon the platform in the english cars the doors are at the sides and not as in america at the ends so that the passengers get out nearly all at once and the platform becomes immediately crowded beyond the platform on the other side there is usually when a train comes in a long row of cabs and carriages drawn up ready to take the passengers from the several cars so that the traveller has generally nothing to do but to step across the platform from the car that he came in to the cab that is waiting there to receive him nor is there as is usual in america any difficulty or delay in regard to the baggage for each man s trunks are placed on the car that he rides in directly over his head so that while he walks across the platform to the cab the railway porter takes his trunk across and places it on the top of the cab and thus he is off from the station in his cab within two minutes sometimes after he arrived at it in the car the railway porters who attend to the business of transferring the passengers thus from the railway carriages to those of the street are very numerous all along the platform and they are very civil and attentive to the passengers especially to those who come in the first class cars and more especially still according to my observation and experience if the traveller has an agreeable looking lady under his charge the porters are dressed in a sort of uniform by which they are readily distinguished from the crowd they are strictly forbidden to receive any fee or gratuity from the passengers this prohibition however does not prevent their taking very thankfully the shillings or sixpences a that are often offered them particularly by americans who being strangers in the country and not understanding the customs very well think that they require a little more attention than others and so are willing to pay a little extra fee it is however contrary to the rules of the station for the porters to receive any thing and if they take it at all they try to do it as secretly as possible i once knew a

given us the marriage ceremony itself before he would have gone out of the prayer book for any united worship whatever it was impossible not to smile at this last act of pious simplicity while it was equally impossible not to be touched with such an evidence of sincere devotion the offering had a soothing influence on all our feelings and most especially on those of the excited females as i came

but i sometimes imagine that i descry a faint reflection of him in john browdie in reference to these gentry i may here quote a few words from the original preface to this book it has afforded the author great amusement and satisfaction during the progress of this work to learn from country friends and from a variety of ludicrous statements concerning himself in provincial newspapers that more than one yorkshire schoolmaster lays claim to being the original of mr squeers one worthy he has reason to believe has actually consulted authorities learned in the law as to his having good grounds on which to rest an action for libel another has meditated a journey to london for the express purpose of committing an assault and battery on his traducer a third perfectly remembers being waited on last january twelve month by two gentlemen one of whom held him in conversation while the other took his likeness and although mr squeers has but one eye and he has two and the published sketch does not resemble him whoever he may be in any other respect still he and all his friends and neighbours know at once for whom it is meant because the character is so like him while the author cannot but feel the full force of the compliment thus conveyed to him he ventures to suggest that these contentions may arise from the fact that mr squeers is the representative of a class and not of an individual where imposture ignorance and brutal cupidity are the stock in trade of a small body of men and one is described by these characteristics all his fellows will recognise something belonging to themselves and each will have a misgiving that the portrait is his own the author s object in calling public attention to the system would be very imperfectly fulfilled if he did not state now in his own person emphatically and earnestly that mr squeers and his school are faint and feeble pictures of an existing reality purposely subdued and kept down lest they should be deemed impossible that there are upon record trials at law in which damages have been sought as a poor recompense for lasting agonies and disfigurements inflicted upon children by the treatment of the master in these places involving such offensive and foul details of neglect cruelty and disease as no writer of fiction would have the boldness to imagine and that since he has been engaged upon these adventures he has received from private quarters far beyond the reach of suspicion or distrust accounts of atrocities in the perpetration of which upon neglected or repudiated children these schools have been the main instruments very far exceeding any that appear in these pages this comprises all i need say on the subject except that if i had seen occasion i had resolved to reprint a few of these details of legal proceedings from certain old newspapers one other quotation from the same preface may serve to introduce a fact that my readers may think curious to turn to a more pleasant subject it may be right to say that there are two characters in this book which are drawn from life it is remarkable that what we call the world which is so very credulous in what professes to be true is most incredulous in what professes to be imaginary and that while every day in real life it will allow in one man no blemishes and in another no virtues it will seldom admit a very strongly marked character either good or bad in a fictitious narrative to be within the limits of probability but those who take an interest in this tale will be glad to learn that the brothers cheeryble live that their liberal charity their singleness of heart their noble nature and their unbounded benevolence are no creations of the author s brain but are prompting every day and oftenest by stealth some munificent and generous deed in that town of which they are the pride and honour if i were to attempt to sum up the thousands of letters from all sorts of people in all sorts of latitudes and climates which this unlucky paragraph brought down upon me i should get into an arithmetical difficulty from which i could not easily extricate myself suffice it to say that i believe the applications for loans gifts and offices of profit that i have been requested to forward to the originals of the brothers cheeryble with whom i never interchanged any communication in my life would have exhausted the combined patronage of all the lord chancellors since the accession of the house of brunswick and would have broken the rest of the bank of england the brothers are now dead there is only one other point on which i would desire to offer a remark if nicholas be not always found to be blameless or agreeable he is not always intended to appear so he is a young man of an impetuous temper and of little or no experience and i saw no reason why such a hero should be lifted out of nature chapter introduces all the rest there once lived in a sequestered part of the county of devonshire one mr godfrey nickleby a worthy

mere attachment who in her turn had taken him for the same reason thus two people who cannot afford to play cards for money sometimes sit down to a quiet game for love some ill conditioned persons who

extreme south west with fingers stretching far out into the atlantic ocean this consists of the counties cork and kerry or a portion rather of those counties it contains killarney glengarriffe bantry and inchigeela and is watered by the lee the blackwater and the flesk i know not where is to be found a land more rich in all that constitutes the loveliness of scenery within this district but hardly within that portion of it which is most attractive to tourists is situated the house and domain of castle richmond the river blackwater rises in the county kerry and running from west to east through the northern part of the county cork enters the county waterford beyond fermoy in its course it passes near the little town of kanturk and through the town of mallow castle richmond stands close upon its banks within the barony of desmond and in that kanturk region through which the mallow and killarney railway now passes but which some thirteen years since knew nothing of the navvy s spade or even of the engineer s theodolite castle richmond was at this period the abode of sir thomas fitzgerald who resided there ever and always with his wife lady fitzgerald his two daughters mary and emmeline fitzgerald and as often as purposes of education and pleasure suited with his son herbert fitzgerald neither sir thomas nor sir thomas s house had about them any of those interesting picturesque faults which are so generally attributed to irish landlords and irish castles he was not out of elbows nor was he an absentee castle richmond had no appearance of having been thrown out of its own windows it was a good substantial modern family residence built not more than thirty years since by the late baronet with a lawn sloping down to the river with kitchen gardens and walls for fruit with ample stables and a clock over the entrance to the stable yard it stood in a well timbered park duly stocked with deer and with foxes also which are agricultural animals much more valuable in an irish county than deer so that as regards its appearance castle richmond might have been in hampshire or essex and as regards his property sir thomas fitzgerald might have been a leicestershire baronet here at castle richmond lived sir thomas with his wife and daughters and here taking the period of our story as being exactly thirteen years since his son herbert was staying also in those hard winter months his oxford degree having been taken and his english pursuits admitting of a temporary sojourn in ireland but sir thomas fitzgerald was not the great man of that part of the country at least not the greatest man nor was lady fitzgerald by any means the greatest lady as this greatest lady and the greatest man also will with their belongings be among the most prominent of our dramatis person it may be well that i should not even say a word of them all the world must have heard of desmond court it is the largest inhabited residence known in that part of the world where rumours are afloat of how it covers ten acres of ground how in hewing the stones for it a whole mountain was cut away how it should have cost hundreds of thousands of pounds only that the money was never paid by the rapacious wicked bloodthirsty old earl who caused it to be erected and how the cement was thickened with human blood so goes rumour with the more romantic of the celtic tale bearers it is a huge place huge ungainly and uselessly extensive built at a time when at any rate in ireland men considered neither beauty aptitude nor economy it is three stories high and stands round a quadrangle in which there are two entrances opposite to each other nothing can be well uglier than that great paved court in which there is not a spot of anything green except where the damp has produced an unwholesome growth upon the stones nothing can well be more desolate and on the outside of the building matters are not much better there are no gardens close up to the house no flower beds in the nooks and corners no sweet shrubs peeping in at the square windows gardens there are but they are away half a mile off and the great hall door opens out upon a flat bleak park with hardly a scrap around it which courtesy can call a lawn here at this period of ours lived clara countess of desmond widow of patrick once earl of desmond and father of patrick now earl of desmond these desmonds had once been mighty men in their country ruling the people around them as serfs and ruling them with hot iron rods but those days were now long gone and,2

people over their own affairs in other words the right of the people to govern themselves did judge douglas invent this not quite the idea of popular sovereignty was floating about several ages before the author of the nebraska bill was born indeed before columbus set foot on this continent in the year it took form in the noble words which you are all familiar with we hold these truths to be self evident that all men are created equal etc was not this the origin of popular sovereignty as applied to the american people here we are told that governments are instituted among men deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed if that is not popular sovereignty then i have no conception of the meaning of words if judge douglas did not invent this kind of popular sovereignty let us pursue the inquiry and find out what kind he did invent was it the right of emigrants to kansas and nebraska to govern themselves and a lot of niggers too if they wanted them clearly this was no invention of his because general cass put forth the same doctrine in in his so called nicholson letter six years before douglas thought of such a thing then what was it that the little giant invented it never occurred to general cass to call his discovery by the odd name of popular sovereignty he had not the face to say that the right of the people to govern niggers was the right of the people to govern themselves his notions of the fitness of things were not moulded to the brazenness of calling the right to put a hundred niggers through under the lash in nebraska a sacred right of self government and here i submit to you was judge douglas s discovery and the whole of it he discovered that the right to breed and flog negroes in nebraska was po,2

whithersoever and howsoever it listed perhaps it is proof of the stunted condition in which pure science especially pure moral science languishes among us english and how our mercantile greatness and invaluable constitution impressing a political or other immediately practical tendency on all english culture and endeavor cramps the free flight of thought that this not philosophy of clothes but recognition even that we have no such philosophy stands here for the first time published in our language what english intellect could have chosen such a topic or by chance stumbled on it but for that same unshackled and even sequestered condition of the german learned which permits and induces them to fish in all manner of waters with all manner of nets it seems probable enough this abtruse inquiry might in spite of the results it leads to have continued dormant for indefinite periods the editor of these sheets though otherwise boasting himself a man of confirmed speculative habits and perhaps discursive enough is free to confess that never till these last months did the above very plain considerations on our total want of a philosophy of clothes occur to him and then by quite foreign suggestion by the arrival namely of a new book from professor teufelsdrockh of weissnichtwo treating expressly of this subject and in a style which whether understood or not could not even by the blindest be overlooked in the present editor s way of thought this remarkable treatise with its doctrines whether as judicially acceded to or judicially denied has not remained without effect die

extensive close printed close meditated sort which be it spoken with pride is seen only in germany perhaps only in weissnichtwo issuing from the hitherto irreproachable firm of stillschweigen and company with every external furtherance it is of such internal quality as to set neglect at defiance a work concludes the well nigh enthusiastic reviewer interesting alike to the antiquary the historian and the philosophic thinker a masterpiece of boldness lynx eyed acuteness and rugged independent germanism and philanthropy derber kerndeutschheit und menschenliebe which will not assuredly pass current without opposition in high places but must and will exalt the almost new name of teufelsdrockh to the first ranks of philosophy in our german temple of honor mindful of old friendship the distinguished professor in this the first blaze of his fame which however does not dazzle him sends hither a presentation copy of his book with compliments and encomiums which modesty forbids the present editor to rehearse yet without indicated wish or hope of any kind except what may be implied in the concluding phrase mochte es this remarkable treatise auch im brittischen boden gedeihen chapter ii editorial difficulties if for a speculative man whose seedfield in the sublime words of the poet is time no conquest is important but that of new ideas then might the arrival of professor teufelsdrockh s book be marked with chalk in the editor s calendar it is indeed an extensive volume of boundless almost formless contents a very sea of thought neither calm nor clear if you will yet wherein the toughest pearl diver may dive to his utmost depth and return not only with sea wreck but with true orients directly on the first perusal almost on the first deliberate inspection it became apparent that here a quite new branch of philosophy leading to as yet undescried ulterior results was disclosed farther what seemed scarcely less interesting a quite new human individuality an almost unexampled personal character that namely of professor teufelsdrockh the discloser of both which novelties as far as might be possible we resolved to master the significance but as man is emphatically a proselytizing creature no sooner was such mastery even fairly attempted than the new question arose how might this acquired good be imparted to others perhaps in equal need thereof how could the philosophy of clothes and the author of such philosophy be brought home in any measure to the business and bosoms of our own english nation for if new got gold is said to burn the pockets till it be cast forth into circulation much more may new truth here however difficulties occurred the first thought naturally was to publish article after article on this remarkable volume in such widely circulating critical journals as the editor might stand connected with or by money or love procure access to but on the other hand was it not clear that such matter as must here be revealed and treated of might endanger the circulation of any journal extant if indeed all party divisions in the state could have been abolished whig tory and radical embracing in discrepant union and all the journals of the nation could have been jumbled into one journal and the philosophy of clothes poured forth in incessant torrents therefrom the attempt had seemed possible but alas what vehicle of that sort have we except fraser s magazine a vehicle all strewed figuratively speaking with the maddest waterloo crackers exploding distractively and destructively wheresoever the mystified passenger stands or sits nay in any case understood to be of late years a vehicle full to overflowing and inexorably shut besides to state the philosophy of clothes without the philosopher the ideas of

were nearly ended and when according to the ordinary routine he might have become a preacher a change of views induced him to abandon the intended profession this appears to have been about the year or when he was twenty four years of age for some time he seems to have been uncertain as to his future course along with irving he employed himself for a year or two as a teacher in fifeshire but gradually it became clear to him that his true vocation was that of literature accordingly parting from irving about the year the younger scot of annandale deliberately embraced the alternative open to him and became a general man of letters probably few have ever embraced that profession with qualifications so wide or with aims so high and severe apart altogether from his diligence in learning and from the extraordinary amount of acquired knowledge of all kinds which was the fruit of it there had been remarked in him from the first a strong originality of character a noble earnestness and fervor in all that he said or did and a vein of inherent constitutional contempt for the mean and the frivolous inclining him in some degree to a life of isolation and solitude add to this that his acquaintance with german literature in particular had familiarized him with ideas modes of thinking and types of literary character not then generally known in this country and yet in his opinion more deserving of being known than much of a corresponding kind that was occupying and ruling british thought the first period of mr carlyle s literary life may be said to extend from to or from his twenty sixth to his thirty second year it was during this period that he produced besides a translation of legendre s geometry to which he prefixed an essay on proportion his numerous well known translations from german writers and also his life of schiller the latter and a considerable proportion of the former were written by him during the leisure afforded him by an engagement he had formed in as tutor to charles buller whose subsequent brilliant though brief career in the politics of britain gives interest to this connection the first part of the life of schiller appeared originally in the london magazine of which john scott was editor and hazlitt charles lamb allan cunningham de quincey and hood were the best known supporters and the second and third parts were published in the same magazine in in this year appeared also the translation of g the s wilhelm meister which was published by messrs oliver and boyd of edinburgh without the translator s name this translation the first real introduction of g the to the reading world of great britain attracted much notice the translator said a critic in blackwood is we understand a young gentleman in this city who now for the first time appears before the public we congratulate him on his very promising debut and would fain hope to receive a series of really good translations from his hand he has evidently a perfect knowledge of german he already writes english better than is at all common even at this time and we know of no exercise more likely to produce effects of permanent advantage upon a young mind of intellectual ambition the advice here given to mr carlyle by his critic was followed by him in so far that in he published in edinburgh his specimens of german romance in four volumes one of these containing wilhelm meister s wanderjahre as a fresh specimen of g the the others containing tales from jean paul tieck mus us and hoffman meanwhile in mr carlyle had revised and enlarged his life of schiller and given it to the world in a separate form through the press of messrs taylor and hessay the proprietors of the london magazine in the same year quitting his tutorship of charles buller he had married a lady fitted in a pre eminent degree to be the wife of such a man it is interesting to know that mrs carlyle originally miss welch is a lineal descendent of the scottish reformer knox for some time after the marriage mr carlyle continued to reside in edinburgh but before he removed to craigenputtoch a small property in the most solitary part of dumfries shire the second period of mr carlyle s literary life extending from to or from his thirty second to his thirty ninth year was the period of the first decided manifestations of his extraordinary originality as a thinker probably the very

further that as masters they confer the said authority voluntarily and this implies that they may give or withhold it as they please to call that deputed which is wrenched from men whether they will or not is nonsense but what is here true of all collectively is equally true of each separately as a government can rightly act for the people only when empowered by them so also can it rightly act for the individual only when empowered by him if a b and c debate whether they shall employ an agent to perform for them a certain service and if whilst a and b agree to do so c dissents c cannot equitably be made a party to the agreement in spite of himself and this must be equally true of thirty as of three and if of thirty why not of three hundred or three thousand or three millions of the political superstitions lately alluded to none is so universally diffused as the notion that majorities are omnipotent under the impression that the preservation of order will ever require power to be wielded by some party the moral sense of our time feels that such power cannot rightly be conferred on any but the largest moiety of society it interprets literally the saying that the voice of the people is the voice of god and transferring to the one the sacredness attached to the other it concludes that from the will of the people that is of the majority there can be no appeal yet is this belief entirely erroneous suppose for the sake of argument that struck by some malthusian panic a legislature duly representing public opinion were to enact that all children born during the next ten years should be drowned does any one think such an enactment would be warrantable if not there is evidently a limit to the power of a majority suppose again that of two races living together celts and saxons for example the most numerous determined to make the others their slaves would the authority of the greatest number be in such case valid if not there is something to which its authority must be subordinate suppose once more that all men having incomes under a year were to resolve upon reducing every income above that amount to their own standard and appropriating the excess for public purposes could their resolution be justified if not it must be a third time confessed that there is a law to which the popular voice must defer what then is that law if not the law of pure equity the law of equal freedom these restraints which all would put to the will of the majority are exactly the restraints set up by that law we deny the right of a majority to murder to enslave or to rob simply because murder enslaving and robbery are violations of that law violations too gross to be overlooked but if great violations of it are wrong so also are smaller ones if the will of the many cannot supersede the first principle of morality in these cases neither can it in any so that however insignificant the minority and however trifling the proposed trespass against their rights no such trespass is permissible when we have made our constitution purely democratic thinks to himself the earnest reformer we shall have brought government into harmony with absolute justice such a faith though perhaps needful for the age is a very erroneous one by no process can coercion be made equitable the freest form of government is only the least objectionable form the rule of the many by the few we call tyranny the rule of the few by the many is tyranny also only of a less intense kind you shall do as we will and not as you will is in either case the declaration and if the hundred make it to ninety nine instead of the ninety nine to the hundred it is only a fraction less immoral of two such parties whichever fulfils this declaration necessarily breaks the law of equal freedom the only difference being that by the one it is broken in the persons of ninety nine whilst by the other it is broken in the persons of a hundred and the merit of the democratic form of government consists solely in this that it trespasses against the smallest number the very existence of majorities and minorities is indicative of an immoral state the man whose character harmonises with the moral law we found to be one who can obtain complete happiness without diminishing the happiness of his fellows but the enactment of public arrangements by vote implies a society consisting of men otherwise constituted implies that the desires of some cannot be satisfied without sacrificing the desires of others implies that in the pursuit of their happiness the majority inflict a certain amount of un happiness on the minority implies therefore organic immorality thus from another point of view we again perceive that even in its most equitable form it is impossible for government to dissociate itself from evil and further that unless the right to ignore the state is recognised its acts must be essentially criminal that a man is free to abandon the benefits and throw off the burdens of citizenship may indeed be inferred from the admissions of existing authorities and of current opinion unprepared as they probably are for so extreme a doctrine as the one here maintained the radicals of our day yet unwittingly profess their belief in a maxim which obviously embodies this doctrine do we not continually hear them quote blackstone s assertion that no subject of england can be constrained to pay any aids or taxes even for the defence of the realm or the support of government but such as are imposed by his own consent or that of his representative in parliament and what does this mean it means say they that every man should have a vote true but it means much more if there is any sense in words it is a distinct enunciation of the very right now contended for in aff,2

mediterranean and on the lakes of switzerland in reality however the vessel was of greater dimensions than even the largest boat and her main mast with its sail was of gigantic proportions she was also full decked and several pieces of heavy ordnance pointed their black muzzles from port holes in her bulwarks no one could have mistaken her character as a vessel of war for besides the guns referred to she had an unusually large crew of bronzed and stalwart men their costume as well as their arms told that these were of eastern origin although there was much variety in detail they all wore the same gold laced jackets the same loose turkish drawers gathered in below the knees and broad silken scarfs round their waists with richly chased silver mounted pistols and yataghans or curved swords some wore the turban others the blue tasselled red fez or tarbouch of tunis while a few contented themselves with a kerchief tied loosely round their heads one who appeared to be the captain of

than any other of his relatives and now will belton was the heir to belton castle for charles amedroz at the age of twenty seven had found the miseries of the world to be too many for him and had put an end to them and to himself charles had been a clever fellow a very clever fellow in the eyes of his father bernard amedroz knew that he himself was not a clever fellow and admired his son accordingly and when charles had been expelled from harrow for some boyish freak in his vengeance against a neighbouring farmer who had reported to the school authorities the doings of a few beagles upon his land charles had cut off the heads of all the trees in a young fir plantation his father was proud of the exploit when he was rusticated a second time from trinity and when the father received an intimation that his son s name had better be taken from the college books the squire was not so well pleased but even then he found some delight in the stories which reached him of his son s vagaries and when the young man commenced bohemian life in london his father did nothing to restrain him then there came the old story debts endless debts and lies endless lies during the two years before his death his father paid for him or undertook to pay nearly ten thousand pounds sacrificing the life assurances which were to have made provision for his daughter sacrificing to a great extent his own life income sacrificing everything so that the property might not be utterly ruined at his death that charles amedroz should be a brighter greater man than any other amedroz had still been the father s pride at the last visit which charles had paid to belton his father had called upon him to pledge himself solemnly that his sister should not be made to suffer by what had been done for him within a month of that time he had blown his brains out in his london lodgings thus making over the entire property to will belton at his father s death at that last pretended settlement with his father and his father s lawyer he had kept back the mention of debts as heavy nearly as those to which he had owned and there were debts of honour too of which he had not spoken trusting to the next event at newmarket to set him right the next event at newmarket had set him more wrong than ever and so there had come an end to everything with charles amedroz this had happened in the spring and the afflicted father afflicted with the double sorrow of his son s terrible death and his daughter s ruin had declared that he would turn his face to the wall and die but the old squire s health though far from strong was stronger than he had deemed it and his feelings sharp enough were less sharp than he had thought them and when a month had passed by he had discovered that it would be better that he should live in order that his daughter might still have bread to eat and a house of her own over her head though he was now an impoverished man there was still left to him the means of keeping up the old home and he told himself that it must if possible be so kept that a few pounds annually might be put by for clara the old carriage horses were sold and the park was let to a farmer up to the hall door of the castle so much the squire could do but as to the putting by of the few pounds any dependence on such exertion as that on his part would we may say be very precarious belton castle was not in truth a castle immediately before the front door so near to the house as merely to allow of a broad road running between it and the entrance porch there stood an old tower which gave its name to the residence an old square tower up which the amedroz boys for three generations had been able to climb by means of the ivy and broken stones in one of the inner corners and this tower was a remnant of a real castle that had once protected the village of belton the house itself was an ugly residence three stories high built in the time of george ii with low rooms and long passages and an immense number of doors it was a large unattractive house unattractive that is as regarded its own attributes but made interesting by the beauty of the small park in which it stood belton park did not perhaps contain much above a hundred acres but the land was so broken into knolls and valleys in so many places was the rock seen to be cropping up through the verdure there were in it so many stunted old oaks so many points of vantage for the lover of scenery that no one would believe it to be other than a considerable domain the farmer who took it and who would not under any circumstances undertake to pay more than seventeen shillings an acre for it could not be made to think that it was in any way considerable but belton park since first it was made a park had never before been regarded after this fashion farmer stovey of the grange was the first man of that class who had ever assumed the right to pasture his sheep in belton chase as the people around were still accustomed to call the woodlands of the estate it was full summer at belton and four months had now passed since the dreadful tidings had reached the castle it was full summer and the people of the village were again going about their ordinary business and the shop girls with their lovers from redicote were again to be seen walking among the oaks in the park on a sunday evening and the world in that district of somersetshire was getting itself back into its grooves the fate of the young heir had disturbed the grooves greatly and had taught many in those parts to feel that the world was coming to an end

the deliberate and voluntary denial of what a man holds to be truth in a matter so sacred as that of religion such a violation of conscience is not justifiable by the end which the renegade may have in view however abstractedly praiseworthy it may be and even granting that his demerit should be gauged by the amount of knowledge which he possesses of what is true and what false the conclusion is inevitable that nothing short of utter ignorance of the precepts of his faith or a p xxi conscientious disbelief in them can fairly relieve the christian who conforms to islamism without a corresponding persuasion of its verity of the deserved odium all honest men attach to apostasy and hypocrisy the reply to this tirade is simply judge not especially when you are ignorant of the case which you are judging perhaps also the writer may ask himself is it right for those to cast stones who dwell in a tenement not devoid of fragility the second attack proceeds from a place whence no man would reasonably have expected it the author of the narrative of a year s journey through central and eastern arabia vol i pp thus expresses his opinions passing oneself off for a wandering darweesh as some european explorers have attempted to do in the east is for more reasons than one a very bad plan it is unnecessary to dilate on that moral aspect of the proceeding which will always first strike unsophisticated minds to feign a religion which the adventurer himself does not believe to perform with scrupulous exactitude as of the highest and holiest import practices which he inwardly ridicules and which he intends on his return to hold up to the ridicule of others to turn for weeks and months together the most sacred and awful bearings of man towards his creator into a deliberate and truthless mummery not to mention other and yet darker touches all this seems hardly compatible with the character of a european gentleman let alone that of a christian this comes admirably a propos from a traveller who born a protestant of jewish descent placed himself in connection with in plain words took the vows of the order of the jesuits an order well known in the annals of philanthropic daring a popular preacher who declaimed openly at bayrut and elsewhere against his own nation till the proceedings of a certain father michael p xxii cohen were made the subject of an

not unfrequently condescended to come and in a mild way led the fashion in silverbridge i can never bring myself to believe it john said miss walker you ll have to bring yourself to believe it said john without taking his eyes from his book a clergyman and such a clergyman too i don t see that that has anything to do with it and as he now spoke john did take his eyes off his book why should not a clergyman turn thief as well as anybody else you girls always seem to forget that clergymen are only men after all their conduct is likely to be better than that of other men i think i deny it utterly said john walker i ll undertake to say that at this moment there are more clergymen in debt in barsetshire than there are either lawyers or doctors this man has always been in debt since he has been in the county i don t think he has ever been able to show his face in the high street of silverbridge john that is saying more than you have a right to say said mrs walker why mother this very cheque was given to a butcher who had threatened a few days before to post bills all about the county giving an account of the debt that was due to him if the money was not paid at once more shame for mr fletcher said mary he has made a fortune as butcher in silverbridge what has that to do with it of course a man likes to have his money he had written three times to the bishop and he had sent a man over to hogglestock to get his little bill settled six days running you see he got it at last of course a tradesman must look for his money mamma do you think that mr crawley stole the cheque mary as she asked the question came and stood over her mother looking at her with anxious eyes i would rather give no opinion my dear but you must think something when everybody is talking about it mamma of course my mother thinks he did said john going back to his book it is impossible that she should think otherwise that is not fair john said mrs walker and i won t have you fabricate thoughts for me or put the expression of them into my mouth the whole affair is very painful and as your father is engaged in the inquiry i think that the less said about the matter in this house the better i am sure that that would be your father s feeling of course i should say nothing about it before him said mary i know that papa does not wish to have it talked about but how is one to help thinking about such a thing it would be so terrible for all of us who belong to the church i do not see that at all said john mr crawley is not more than any other man just because he s a clergyman i hate all that kind of clap trap there are a lot of people here in silverbridge who think the matter shouldn t be followed up just because the man is in a position which makes the crime more criminal in him than it would be in another but i feel sure that mr crawley has committed no crime at all said mary my dear said mrs walker i have just said that i would rather you would not talk about it papa will be in directly i won t mamma only only yes just only said john she d go on till dinner if any one would stay to hear her you ve said twice as much as i have john but john had left the room before his sister s last words could reach him you know mamma it is quite impossible not to help thinking of it said mary i dare say it is my dear and when one knows the people it does make it so dreadful but do you know them i never spoke to mr crawley in my life and i do not think i ever saw her i knew grace very well when she used to come first to miss prettyman s school poor girl i pity her pity her pity is no word for it mamma my heart bleeds for them and yet i do not believe for a moment that he stole the cheque how can it be possible for though he may have been in debt because they have been so very very poor yet we all know that he has been an excellent clergyman when the robartses were dining here last i heard mrs robarts say that for piety and devotion to his duties she had hardly ever seen any one equal to him and the robartses know more of them than anybody they say that the dean is his great friend what a pity it is that the arabins should be away just now when he is in such trouble and in this way the mother and daughter went on discussing the question of the clergyman s guilt in spite of mrs walker s previously expressed desire that nothing more might be said about it but mrs walker like many other mothers was apt to be more free in converse with her daughter than she was with her son while they were thus talking the father came in from his office and then the

proper but an association of states in the nature of contract merely can it as a contract be peaceably unmade by less than all the parties who made it one party to a contract may violate it break it so to speak but does it not require all to lawfully rescind it descending from these general principles we find the proposition that in legal contemplation the union is perpetual confirmed by the history of the union itself the union is much older than the constitution it was formed in fact by the articles of association in it was matured and continued by the declaration of independence in it was further matured and the faith of all the then thirteen states expressly plighted and engaged that it should be perpetual by the articles of confederation in and finally in one of the declared objects for ordaining and establishing the constitution was to form a more perfect union but if the destruction of the union by one or by a part only of the states be lawfully possible the union is less perfect than before the constitution having lost the vital element of perpetuity it follows from these views that no state upon its own mere motion can lawfully get out of the union that resolves and ordinances to that effect are legally void and that acts of violence within any state or states against the authority of the united states are insurrectionary or revolutionary according to circumstances i therefore consider that in view of the constitution and the laws the union is unbroken and to the extent of my ability i shall take care as the constitution itself expressly enjoins upon me that the laws of the union be faithfully executed in all the states doing this i deem to be only a simple duty on my part and i shall perform it so far as practicable unless my rightful masters the american people shall withhold the requisite means or in some authoritative manner direct the contrary i trust this will not be regarded as a menace but only as the declared purpose of the union that it will constitutionally defend and maintain itself in doing this there needs to be no bloodshed or violence and there shall be none unless it be forced upon the national authority the power confided to me will be used to hold occupy and possess the property and places belonging to the government and to collect the duties and imposts but beyond what may be necessary for these objects there will be no invasion no using of force against or among the people anywhere where hostility to the united states in any interior locality shall be so great and universal as to prevent competent resident citizens from holding the federal offices there will be no attempt to force obnoxious strangers among the people for that object while the strict legal right may exist in the government to enforce the exercise of these offices the attempt to do so would be so irritating and so nearly impracticable withal that i deem it better to forego for the time the uses of such offices

apparent that here a quite new branch of philosophy leading to as yet undescried ulterior results was disclosed farther what seemed scarcely less interesting a quite new human individuality an almost unexampled personal character that namely of professor teufelsdrockh the discloser of both which novelties as far as might be possible we resolved to master the significance but as man is emphatically a proselytizing creature no sooner was such mastery even fairly attempted than the new question arose how might this acquired good be imparted to others perhaps in equal need thereof how could the philosophy of clothes and the author of such philosophy be brought home in any measure to the business and bosoms of our own english nation for if new got gold is said to burn the pockets till it be cast forth into circulation much more may new truth here however difficulties occurred the first thought naturally was to publish article after article on this remarkable volume in such widely circulating critical journals as the editor might stand connected with or by money or love procure access to but on the other hand was it not clear that such matter as must here be revealed and treated of might endanger the circulation of any journal extant if indeed all party divisions in the state could have been abolished whig tory and radical embracing in discrepant union and all the journals of the nation could have been jumbled into one journal and the philosophy of clothes poured forth in incessant torrents therefrom the attempt had seemed possible but alas what vehicle of that

prehistoric epoch pre geologic time the views indicated in fact are not only quite consistent with the hypothesis that in the still earlier period referred to the condition of our world was very different but they may be held by some to necessitate that hypothesis the physical philosopher who is accurately acquainted with the velocity of a cannon ball and the precise character of the line which it traverses for a yard of its course is necessitated by what he knows of the laws of nature to conclude that it came from a certain spot whence it was impelled by a certain force and that it has followed a certain trajectory in like manner the student of physical geology who fully believes in the uniformity of the general condition of the earth through geologic time may feel compelled by what he knows of causation and by the general analogy of nature to suppose that our solar system was once a nebulous mass that it gradually condensed that it broke up into that wonderful group of harmoniously rolling balls we call planets and satellites and that then each of these underwent its appointed metamorphosis until at last our own share of the cosmic vapour passed into that condition in which we first meet with definite records of its state and in which it has since with comparatively little change remained the doctrine of uniformity and the doctrine of progression are therefore perfectly consistent perhaps indeed they might be shown to be necessarily connected with one another if however the condition of the world which has obtained throughout geologic time is but the sequel to a vast series of changes which took place in pre geologic time then it seems not unlikely that the duration of this latter is to that of the former as the vast extent of geologic time is to the length of the brief epoch we call the historical period and that even the oldest rocks are records of an epoch almost infinitely remote from that which could have witnessed the first shaping of our globe it is probable that no modern geologist would hesitate to admit the general validity of these reasonings when applied to the physics of his subject whence it is the more remarkable that the moment the question changes from one of physics and chemistry to one of natural history scientific opinions and the popular prejudices which reflect them in a distorted form undergo a sudden metamorphosis geologists and palaeontologists write about the beginning of life and the first created forms of living beings as if they were the most familiar things in the world and even cautious writers seem to be on quite friendly terms with the archetype whereby the creator was guided amidst the crash of falling worlds just as it used to be imagined that the ancient world was physically opposed to the present so it is still widely assumed that the living population of our globe whether animal or vegetable in the older epochs exhibited forms so strikingly contrasted with those which we see around us that there is hardly anything in common between the two it is constantly tacitly assumed that we have before us all the forms of life which have ever existed and though the progress of knowledge yearly and almost monthly drives the defenders of that position from their ground they entrench themselves in the new line of defences as if nothing had happened and proclaim that the new beginning is the real beginning without for an instant denying or endeavouring to soften down the considerable positive differences the negative ones are met by another line of argument which undoubtedly obtain between the ancient and the modern worlds of life we believe they have been vastly overstated and exaggerated and this belief is based upon certain facts whose value does not seem to have been fully appreciated though they have long been more or less completely known the multitudinous kinds of animals and plants both recent and fossil are as is well known arranged by zoologists and botanists in accordance with their natural relations into groups which receive the names of sub kingdoms classes orders families genera and species now it is a most remarkable circumstance that viewed on the great scale living beings have differed so little throughout all geologic time that there is no sub kingdom and no class wholly extinct or without living representatives if we descend to the smaller groups we find that the number of orders of plants is about two hundred and i have it on the best authority that not one of these is exclusively fossil so that there is absolutely not a single extinct ordinal type of vegetable life and it is not until we descend to the next group or the families that we find types which are wholly extinct the number of orders of animals on the other

does not exceed seven per cent a marvellously small proportion when we consider the vastness of geologic time another class of considerations of a different kind it is true but tending in the same direction seems to have been overlooked not only is it true that the general plan of construction of animals and plants has been the same in all recorded time as at present but there are particular kinds of animals and plants which have existed throughout vast epochs sometimes through the whole range of recorded time with very little change by reason of this persistency the typical form of such a kind might be called a persistent type in contradistinction to those types which have appeared for but a short time in the course of the world s history examples of these persistent types are

make pitt at his zenith in public reputation friedrich never so low before nothing seemingly but extinction near ahead when this year ended the truth is apart from his specific pieces of ill luck there had now begun for friedrich a new rule of procedure which much altered his appearance in the world thrice over had he tried by the aggressive or invasive method thrice over made a plunge at the enemy s heart hoping so to disarm or lame him but that with resources spent to such a degree is what he cannot do a fourth time he is too weak henceforth to think of that prussia has always its king and his unrivalled talent but that is pretty much the only fixed item prussia versus france austria russia sweden and the german reich what is it as a field of supplies for war except its king these are failing year by year and at a rate fatally swift in comparison friedrich cannot now do leuthens rossbachs far shining feats of victory which astonish all the world his fine prussian veterans have mostly perished and have been replaced by new levies and recruits who are inferior both in discipline and native quality though they have still people say a noteworthy taste of the old prussian sort in them and do in fact fight well to the last but it is observable says retzow somewhere and indeed it follows from the nature of the case that while the prussian army presents always its best kind of soldiers at the beginning of a war austria such are its resources in population always improves in that particular and its best troops appear in the last campaigns in a word friedrich stands on the defensive henceforth disputing his ground inch by inch and is reduced more and more to battle obscurely with a hydra coil of enemies and impediments and to do heroisms which make no noise in the gazettes and alas which cannot figure in history either what is more a sorrow to me here friedrich say all judges of soldiership and human character who have studied friedrich sufficiently is greater than ever in these four years now coming berenhorst in kriegskunst retzow c and this i have found more and more to be a true thing verifiable and demonstrable in time and place though unluckily for us hardly in this time or this place at all a thing which cannot by any method be made manifest to the general reader who delights in shining summary feats and is impatient of tedious preliminaries and investigations especially of maps which are the indispensablest requisite of all a thing in short that belongs peculiarly to soldier students who can undergo the dull preliminaries most dull but most inexorably needed and can follow out with watchful intelligence and with a patience not to be wearied the multifarious topographies details of movements and manoeuvrings year after year on such a theatre of war what is to be done with it here if we could by significant strokes indicate under features true so far as they went the great wide fire flood that was raging round the world if we could carefully omitting very many things omit of the things intelligible and decipherable that concern friedrich himself nothing that had meaning if indeed but it is idle preluding forward again brave reader under such conditions as there are friedrich s winter in breslau was of secluded silent sombre character this time nothing of stir in it but from work only in marked contrast with the last and its kindly visitors and gayeties a friedrich given up to his manifold businesses to his silent sorrows i have passed my winter like a carthusian monk he writes to d argens i dine alone i spend my life in reading and writing and i do not sup when one is sad it becomes at last too burdensome to hide one s grief continually and it is better to give way to it by oneself than to carry one s gloom into society nothing solaces me but the vigorous application required in steady and continuous labor this distraction does force one to put away painful ideas while it lasts but alas no sooner is the work done than these fatal companions present themselves again as if livelier than ever maupertuis was right the sum of evil does certainly surpass that of good but to me it is all one i have almost nothing more to lose and my few remaining days what matters it much of what complexion they be breslau st march to d argens oeuvres de frederic xix the loss of his wilhelmina had there been no other grief has darkened all his life to friedrich readers are not prepared for the details of grief we could give and the settled gloom of mind they indicate a loss irreparable and immeasurable the light

such all winter he dwells internally on the sad matter though soon falling silent on it to others the war is ever more dark and dismal to him a wearing harassing nearly disgusting task on which however depends life or death this year he expects to have enemies upon him and is with his utmost effort getting up to set against them of business in its many kinds there can be no lack in the

amusements of the charms of ladies society he had known but little very many of the estates around him had been absolutely abandoned as was the case with his own coffee plantation and from others men had sent away their wives and daughters nay most of the proprietors had gone themselves leaving an overseer to extract what little might yet be extracted out of the property it too often happened that that little was not sufficient to meet the demands of the overseer himself the house at mount pleasant had been an irregular low roofed picturesque residence built with only one floor and surrounded on all sides by large verandahs in the old days it had always been kept in perfect order but now this was far from being the case few young bachelors can keep a house in order but no bachelor young or old can do so under such a doom as that of maurice cumming every shilling that maurice cumming could collect was spent in bribing negroes to work for him but bribe as he would the negroes would not work no massa me pain here me no workee to day and sambo would lay his fat hand on his fat stomach i have said that he lived generally alone occasionally his house on mount pleasant was enlivened by visits of an aunt a maiden sister of his mother whose usual residence was at spanish town it is or should be known to all men that spanish town was and is the seat of jamaica legislature but maurice was not over fond of his relative in this he was both wrong and foolish for miss sarah jack such was her name was in many respects a good woman and was certainly a rich woman it is true that she was not a handsome woman nor a fashionable woman nor perhaps altogether an agreeable woman she was tall thin ungainly and yellow her voice which she used freely was harsh she was a politician and a patriot she regarded england as the greatest of countries and jamaica as the greatest of colonies but much as she loved england she was very loud in denouncing what she called the perfidy of the mother to the brightest of her children and much as she loved jamaica she was equally severe in her taunts against those of her brother islanders who would not believe that the island might yet flourish as it had flourished in her father s days it is because you and men like you will not do your duty by your country she had said some score of times to maurice not with much justice considering the laboriousness of his life but maurice knew well what she meant what could i do there up at spanish town he would answer among such a pack as there are there here i may do something and then she would reply with the full swing of her eloquence it is because you and such as you think only of yourself and not of jamaica that jamaica has come to such a pass as this why is there a pack there as you call them in the honourable house of assembly why are not the best men in the island to be found there as the best men in england are to be found in the british house of commons a pack indeed my father was proud of a seat in that house and i remember the day maurice cumming when your father also thought it no shame to represent his own parish if men like you who have a stake in the country will not go there of course the house is filled with men who have no stake if they are a pack it is you who send them there you and others like you all had its effect though at the moment maurice would shrug his shoulders and turn away his head from the torrent of the lady s discourse but miss jack though she was not greatly liked was greatly respected maurice would not own that she convinced him but at last he did allow his name to be put up as candidate for his own parish and in due time he became a member of the honourable house of assembly in jamaica this honour entails on the holder of it the necessity of living at or within reach of spanish town for some ten weeks towards the chose of every year now on the whole face of the uninhabited globe there is perhaps no spot more dull to look at more lethean in its aspect more corpse like or more cadaverous than spanish town it is the head quarters of the government the seat of the legislature the residence of the governor but nevertheless it is as it were a city of the very dead here as we have said before lived miss jack in a large forlorn ghost like house in which her father and all her family had lived before her and as a matter of course maurice cumming when he came up to attend to his duties as a member of the legislature took up his abode with her now at the time of which we are specially speaking he had completed the first of these annual visits he had already benefited his country by sitting out one session of the colonial parliament and had satisfied himself that he did no other good than that of keeping away some person more objectionable than himself he was however prepared to repeat this self sacrifice in a spirit of patriotism for which he received a very meagre meed of eulogy from miss jack and an amount of self applause which was not much more extensive down at mount pleasant i can do something he would say over and over again but what good can any man do up here you can do your duty miss jack would answer as others did before you when the colony was made to prosper and then they would run off into a long discussion about free labour and protective duties but at the present moment maurice cumming had another vexation on his mind over and above that arising from his wasted hours at spanish town and his fruitless labours at mount pleasant he was in love and was not altogether satisfied with the conduct of his lady love miss jack had other nephews besides maurice cumming and nieces also of whom marian leslie was one,2

without his leave yes said waldron i will so he and rollo went away and walked leisurely towards the place where mr george was sitting i am glad we are coming up this river to greenock and glasgow said waldron why asked rollo because of the steamboats said waldron do they build a great many steamboats in greenock and glasgow asked rollo yes said waldron this is the greatest place for building steamboats in the world except new york said rollo o of course except new york replied waldron but they build all the big english steamers in this river all the cunarders were built here and they have got some of the best machine shops and founderies here that there are in the world i should like to go all about and see them if i could only get away from my mother why won t she let you go said rollo no replied waldron not if she knows it she thinks i am a little boy and is so afraid that i shall get hurt waldron pronounced the word hurt in a drawling and contemptuous tone which was so comical that rollo could not help laughing outright i go to all the ship yards and founderies in new york whenever i please continued waldron i go when she does not know it sometimes the men let me help them carry out the melted iron and pour it into the moulds by this time the two boys had reached the place where mr george was he was sitting on what is called a camp stool and was engaged in reading his guide book and studying the map with a view of finding out what route it would be best to take in the tour they were about making in scotland mr george drew the boys into conversation with him on the subject his object was to become acquainted with waldron and find out what sort of a boy he was where do you wish to go waldron said mr george why i want to stay here a good many days said waldron to see the steamers and the dockyards they are building a monstrous iron ship somewhere here she is going to be five hundred tons bigger than the baltic i should like to see her said mr george as he said this he kept his eye upon his map following his finger as he moved it about from place to place as if he was studying out a good way to go there is edinburgh said mr george we must certainly go to edinburgh yes said waldron i suppose that is a pretty great place besides i want to see the houses twelve stories high and there is linlithgow continued mr george still looking upon his map that is the place where mary queen of scots was born waldron would you like to go there why no said waldron doubtfully not much i don t care much about that it is a famous old ruin said mr george but i don t care much about the old ruins said waldron if the lords and noblemen are as rich as people say they are i should think they would mend them up and here off in the western part of scotland continued mr george are a great many mountains would you like to go and see the mountains no sir said waldron not particularly then in a moment he added can we go up to the top of them mr george yes said mr george we can go to the top of some of them the highest asked waldron yes said mr george ben nevis i believe is the highest we can go to the top of that then i should like to go said waldron eagerly unless continued mr george it should rain too hard o i should not care for the rain said waldron it s good fun to go in the rain while this conversation had been going on waldron had been looking this way and that at the various ships and steamers that were gliding about on the water examining carefully the building of each one and watching her motions he now proposed that rollo should go forward to the bridge with him where they could have a better lookout well said rollo so the two boys went together to the bridge the bridge was a sort of narrow platform extending across the steamer from one paddle wheel to the other for the captain or pilot to walk upon in order to see how the steamer was going and to direct the steering when they are in the open sea any of the passengers are allowed to walk here but in coming into port or into a river crowded with shipping then a notice is put up requesting passengers not to go upon the bridge inasmuch as at such times it is required for the exclusive use of the captain and pilot this notice was up when waldron and rollo reached the bridge see said rollo pointing at the notice we cannot go there o never mind that said waldron they ll let us go they only mean that they don t want too many there that s all but rollo would not go mr george had accustomed him in travelling about the world always to obey all lawful rules and orders and particularly every direction of this kind which he might find in public places some people are very much inclined to crowd upon the line of such rules and even to encroach upon them till they actually encounter some resistance to drive them back they do this partly to show their independence and importance but mr george was not one of this sort so rollo would not go upon the bridge then let us go out on the forecastle said waldron he pointed as he spoke to the forecastle which is a small raised deck at the bows of a steamer where there is an excellent place to see no said

you have got you at your time of life why well all i can say is you ought to know better then father and mother settled peacefully down and forgot all about their disagreement since they had blessedly been relieved of the presence of their talented daughter who until her marriage had been polite to them to such an extent that for years they had lived in terror they had made rather a point of being naughty and noisy and happy together but by and by they would get tired and look affectionately across the table and purr father tinkered away at a broken lamp shade till suddenly without warning he declared that mother scolded him merely to conceal her faith in his ability to do anything she sniffed but she knew that he was right for years mother had continued to believe in the cleverness of seth appleby who in his youth had promised to become manager of the shoe store and gave the same promise to day father justified his shameless boast by compelling mr pilkings to grant him the usual leave of absence and they prepared to start for west skipsit cape cod where they always spent their vacations at the farm house of uncle joe tubbs mother took a week to pack and unpack to go panting down stairs to the corner drug store for new tubes of tooth paste and a presentable sponge to remend all that was remendable to press father s flappy shapeless little trousers with the family flat iron to worry over whether she should take the rose pink or the daffodil yellow wrapper which had both faded to approximately the same shade of gray but which were to her trusting mind still interestingly different each year she had to impress mrs tubbs of west skipsit with new metropolitan finery and this year father had no peace nor comfort in the m nage till she had selected a smart new hat incredibly small and close and sinking coyly down over her ear he was only a man folk he was in the way incapable of understanding this problem of fashion and mother almost slapped him one evening for suggesting that it wouldn t make such a gosh awful lot of difference if she didn t find some new fad to impress sister tubbs but mother wearied of repacking their two cheap wicker suit cases and the brown pasteboard box and father suddenly came to the front in his true capacity as boss and leader he announced loudly on the evening before they were to depart we re going to have a party to night old lady at the masterful tones of this man of the world who wasn t afraid of train or travel who had gone successfully through the mysteries of purchasing transportation clear to cape cod mother looked impressed but she said doubtfully oh do you think we better father we ll be traveling and all yes sir ee we re going to a movie and then we re going to have a banana split and i m going to carry my cane and smoke a seegar you know mighty well you like the movies as well as i do acting up like a young smarty mother said but she obediently put on her hat lord no not the new small hat that was kept to impress west skipsit massachusetts and as she trotted to the movies beside him the two of them like solemn white puppies venturing away from their mother she occasionally looked admiringly up a whole inch up at her hero chapter ii they took the steamer for massachusetts at five o clock when the band started to play when mother feared that a ferry was going to collide with them when beautiful youths in boating hats popped out of state rooms like chorus men in a musical comedy when children banged small sand pails when the steamer rounded the dream castles of lower new york when it seemed inconceivable that the flag staff could get under brooklyn bridge which didn t clear it by much more than a hundred feet when a totally new new york of factories and docks of steamers bound for ceylon and yachts bound for newport was revealed to these old new yorkers then mother mingled a terrific apprehension regarding ships and water with a palpitating excitement over sailing into the freedom which these two gray haired children had longed for all their lives and had found during two weeks of each year father was perfectly tremendous he apprehensive why he might have been the original man to go down to the sea in ships mother wailed that all the deck chairs had been taken father found mountains of chairs and flipped a couple of them open as though he were a steward with service stripes he was simply immense in his manner of thrusting mother and himself and his chairs and a mound of shawls and coats into the midst of the crowd gathered at the bow he noted mother s nervousness and observed casually mighty safe these boats like ferries safer n trains yes they re safer n staying home in bed what with burgulars and fires and everything oh do you really think they are safe breathed mother comforted admirable though father was he couldn t sit still he was wearing a decorative new traveling cap very smart and extensive and expensive shaped like a muffin and patterned with the douglas tartan and an etruscan border he rather wanted to let people see it he was no pilkings clerk now but a world galloper with his cap clapped down on one side and

across the river from side to side the town is filled with magnificent churches and palaces built some of them a thousand years ago and all so richly adorned with sculptures paintings bronzes and mosaics that the whole world flock there to see them people go there chiefly in the winter at that season the town is crowded with strangers a great many people too go there in the winter to avoid the cold weather which prevails at that time of the year in all the more northerly countries of europe there is so little winter in florence that few of the houses have any fireplaces in them except in the kitchen when there comes a cold day the people warm themselves by means of a jug or jar of earthen ware with a handle passing over across the top by which they carry it about they fill these jars half full of hot embers and so carry them with them wherever they want to go the women when they sit down put the jar under their dresses on the floor or pavement beneath them and the men place it right before them between their feet you will see market women and flower girls sitting in the corners of the streets in the winter attending to their business and keeping themselves warm all the time with these little fire jars and artists in the palaces and picture galleries each with one of them by his side or close before him while he is at work copying the works of the great masters or making drawings from the antique statues there is another very curious use that the people of florence make of these jars and that is they warm the beds with them when any body is sick so as to require this indulgence you would think it very difficult to warm a bed with an open jar filled with burning embers the way they do it is this they hang the jar in the inside of a sort of wooden cage shaped like a bushel basket and about as large they turn this cage upside down and hang the jar up in it by means of a hook depending inside they turn down the bed clothes and put the cage in it jar of coals and all they then put back the bed clothes and cover the cage all up they leave it so for a quarter of an hour and then carefully turning the clothes down again they take the jar out and the bed is warmed but to return to mr george and rollo they engaged a vetturino for the first time at florence mr george had gone to florence chiefly for the purpose of examining the immense collections of paintings and statuary which exist there rollo went not on account of the paintings or statues for he did not care much about such things but because he liked to go any where where he could see new places and be entertained by new scenes accordingly while mr george was at work in the galleries of florence studying by the help of catalogues the famous specimens of ancient art rollo was usually rambling about the streets observing the manners and customs of the people and watching the singular and curious scenes that every where met his eye the reason why there are so many paintings and sculptures in italy is this in the middle ages it was the fashion in all the central parts of europe for the people to spend almost all their surplus money in building and decorating churches indeed there was then very little else that they could do at the present time people invest their funds as fast as they accumulate them in building ships and railroads docks for the storage of merchandise houses and stores in cities to let for the sake of the rent and country seats or pretty private residences of various kinds for themselves but in the middle ages very little could be done in the way of investments like these there were no railroads and there was very little use for ships there was no profit to be gained by building houses and stores for there were so many wars and commotions among the people of the different towns and kingdoms that nothing was stable or safe for the same reason it was useless for men to spend their money in building and ornamenting their own houses for at the first approach of an enemy the town in which they lived was likely to be sacked and their houses and all the fine furniture which they might contain would be burned or destroyed but the churches were safe the people of the different countries had so much veneration for sacred places and for every thing connected with religion that they were afraid to touch or injure any thing that had been consecrated to a religious use to plunder a church or a convent or an abbey or to do any thing to injure or destroy the property that they contained was regarded as sacrilege and sacrilege they deemed a dreadful crime abhorred by god and man thus while they would burn and destroy hundreds of dwellings without any remorse and turn the wretched inmates out at midnight into the streets to die of exposure terror and despair they would stop at once when they came to the church afraid to harm it in any way or to touch the least thing that it contained accordingly while every thing else in a conquered town was doomed to the most reckless destruction all that was in the church the most delicate paintings and the most costly gold and silver images and utensils were as safe as if they were surrounded by impregnable castle walls of course these notions were very mistaken ones according to the teachings of our lord and saviour jesus christ it must be a greater sin to burn down the cottage of a poor widow and turn her out at midnight into the streets to die than to plunder for gain the richest altar in the world from these and various other similar causes it happened that in the middle ages that is from five hundred to a thousand years ago almost all the great expenditures of money in all the great cities and towns of europe were made for churches sometimes these churches were so lar,2

having been endowed at its birth or during its growth with proper means for accommodating its own increasing proportions was it not well to lay down fine avenues and broad streets so that future citizens might find a city well prepared to their hand there is no doubt much in such an argument but its correctness must be tested by its success when a man marries it is well that be should make provision for a coming family but a benedict who early in his career shall have carried his friends with considerable self applause through half a dozen nurseries and at the end of twelve years shall still be the father of one rickety baby will incur a certain amount of ridicule it is very well to be prepared for good fortune but one should limit one s preparation within a reasonable scope two miles by one might perhaps have done for the skeleton sketch of a new city less than half that would contain much more than the present population of washington and there are i fear few towns in the union so little likely to enjoy any speedy increase three avenues sweep the whole length of washington virginia avenue pennsylvania avenue and massachusetts avenue but pennsylvania avenue is the only one known to ordinary men and the half of that only is so known this avenue is the backbone of the city and those streets which are really inhabited cluster round that half of it which runs westward from the capitol the eastern end running from the front of the capitol is again a desert the plan of the city is somewhat complicated it may truly be called a mighty maze but not without a plan the capitol was intended to be the center of the city it faces eastward away from the potomac or rather from the main branch of the potomac and also unfortunately from the main body of the town it turns its back upon the chief thoroughfare upon the treasury buildings and upon the president s house and indeed upon the whole place it was i suppose intended that the streets to the eastward should be noble and populous but hitherto they have come to nothing the building therefore is wrong side foremost and all mankind who enter it senators representatives and judges included go in at the back door of course it is generally known that in the capitol is the chamber of the senate that of the house of representatives and the supreme judicial court of the union it may be said that there are two centers in washington this being one and the president s house the other at these centers the main avenues are supposed to cross each other which avenues are called by the names of the respective states at the capitol pennsylvania avenue new jersey avenue delaware avenue and maryland avenue converge they come from one extremity of the city to the square of the capitol on one side and run out from the other side of it to the other extremity of the city pennsylvania avenue new york avenue vermont avenue and connecticut avenue do the same at what is generally called president s square in theory or on paper this seems to be a clear and intelligible arrangement but it does not work well these center depots are large spaces and consequently one portion of a street is removed a considerable distance from the other it is as though the same name should be given to two streets one of which entered st james s park at buckingham gate while the other started from the park at marlborough house to inhabitants the matter probably is not of much moment as it is well known that this portion of such an avenue and that portion of such another avenue are merely myths unknown lands away in the wilds but a stranger finds himself in the position of being sent across the country knee deep into the mud wading through snipe grounds looking for civilization where none exists all these avenues have a slanting direction they are so arranged that none of them run north and south or east and west but the streets so called all run in accordance with the points of the compass those from east to west are a street b street c street and so on counting them away from the capitol on each side so that there are two a streets and two b streets on the map these streets run up to v street both right and left v street north and v street south those really known to mankind are e f g h i and k streets north then those streets which run from north to south are numbered first street second street third street and so on on each front of the capitol running to twenty fourth or twenty fifth street on each side not very many of these have any existence or i might perhaps more properly say any vitality in their existence such is the plan of the city that being the arrangement and those the dimensions intended by the original architects and founders of washington but the inhabitants have hitherto confined themselves to pennsylvania avenue west and to the streets abutting from it or near to it whatever address a stranger may receive however perplexing it may seem to him he may be sure that the house indicated is near pennsylvania avenue if it be not i should recommend him to pay no attention to the summons even in those streets with which he will become best acquainted the houses are not continuous there will be a house and then a blank then two houses and then a double blank after that a hut or two and then probably an excellent roomy handsome family mansion taken altogether washington as a city is most unsatisfactory and falls more grievously short of the thing attempted than any other of the great undertakings of which i have seen anything in the states san jose the capital of the republic of costa rica in central america has been prepared and arranged as a new city in the same way but even san jose comes nearer to what was intended than

understandings against the hostility of their feelings and practical tendencies and truly the understandings of the majority of mankind would need to be much better cultivated than has ever yet been the case before they can be asked to place such reliance in their own power of estimating arguments as to give up practical principles in which they have been born and bred and which are the basis of much of the existing order of the world at the first argumentative attack which they are not capable of logically resisting i do not therefore quarrel with them for having too little faith in argument but for having too much faith in custom and the general feeling it is one of the characteristic prejudices of the reaction of the nineteenth century against the eighteenth to accord to the unreasoning elements in human nature the infallibility which the eighteenth century is supposed to have ascribed to the reasoning elements for the apotheosis of reason we have substituted that of instinct and we call everything instinct which we find in ourselves and for which we cannot trace any rational foundation this idolatry infinitely more degrading than the other and the most pernicious of the false worships of the present day of all of which it is now the main support will probably hold its ground until it gives way before a sound psychology laying bare the real root of much that is bowed down to as the intention of nature and the ordinance of god as regards the present question i am willing to accept the unfavourable conditions which the prejudice assigns to me i consent that established custom and the general feeling should be deemed conclusive against me unless that custom and feeling from age to age can be shown to have owed their existence to other causes than their soundness and to have derived their power from the worse rather than the better parts of human nature i am willing that judgment should go against me unless i can show that my judge has been tampered with the concession is not so great as it might appear for to prove this is by far the easiest portion of my task the generality of a practice is in some cases a strong presumption that it is or at all events once was conducive to laudable ends this is the case when the practice was first adopted or afterwards kept up as a means to such ends and was grounded on experience of the mode in which they could be most effectually attained if the authority of men over women when first established had been the result of a conscientious comparison between different modes of constituting the government of society if after trying various other modes of social organization the government of women over men equality between the two and such mixed and divided modes of government as might be invented it had been decided on the testimony of experience that the mode in which women are wholly under the rule of men having no share at all in public concerns and each in private being under the legal obligation of obedience to the man with whom she has associated her destiny was the arrangement most conducive to the happiness and well being of both its general adoption might then be fairly thought to be some evidence that at the time when it was adopted if was the best though even then the considerations which recommended it may like so many other primeval social facts of the greatest importance have subsequently in the course of ages ceased to exist but the state of the case is in every respect the reverse of this in the first place the opinion in favour of the present system which entirely subordinates the weaker sex to the stronger rests upon theory only for there never has been trial made of any other so that experience in the sense in which it is vulgarly opposed to theory cannot be pretended to have pronounced any verdict and in the second place the adoption of this system of inequality never was the result of deliberation or forethought or any social ideas or any notion whatever of what conduced to the benefit of humanity or the good order of society it arose simply from the fact that from the very earliest twilight of human society every woman owing to the value attached to her by men combined with her inferiority in muscular strength was found in a state of bondage to some man laws and systems of polity always begin by recognising the relations they find already existing between individuals they convert what was a mere physical fact into a legal right give it the sanction of society and principally aim at the substitution of public and organized means of asserting and protecting these rights instead of the irregular and lawless conflict of physical strength those who had already been compelled to obedience became in this manner legally bound to it slavery from being a mere affair of force between the master and the slave became regularized and a matter of compact among the masters who binding themselves to one another for common protection guaranteed by their collective strength the private possessions of each including his slaves in early times the great majority of the male sex were slaves as well as the whole of the female and many ages elapsed some of them ages of high cultivation before any thinker was bold enough to question the rightfulness and the absolute social necessity either of the one slavery or of the other by degrees such thinkers did arise and the general progress of society assisting the slavery of the male sex has in all the countries of christian europe at least though in one of them only within the last few years been at length abolished and that of the female sex has been gradually changed into a milder form of dependence but this dependence as it exists at present is not an original

under him who was forward to tell what he could or would do if he could only get sight of the enemy he had but little confidence in him he was never able to find more than a score or so of recruits whom he would accept and only about a dozen among them his sons in whom he had perfect faith when he was here some years ago he showed to a few a little manuscript book his orderly book i think he called it containing the names of his company in kansas and the rules by which they bound themselves and he stated that several of them had already sealed the contract with their blood when some one remarked that with the addition of a chaplain it would have been a perfect cromwellian troop he observed that he would have been glad to add a chaplain to the list if he could have found one who could fill that office worthily it is easy enough to find one for the united states army i believe that he had prayers in his camp morning and evening nevertheless he was a man of spartan habits and at sixty was scrupulous about his diet at your table excusing himself by saying that he must eat sparingly and fare hard as became a soldier or one who was fitting himself for difficult enterprises a life of exposure a man of rare common sense and directness of speech as of action a transcendentalist above all a man of ideas and principles that was what distinguished him not yielding to a whim or transient impulse but carrying out the purpose of a life i noticed that he did not overstate anything but spoke within bounds i remember particularly how in his speech here he referred to what his family had suffered in kansas without ever giving the least vent to his pent up fire it was a volcano with an ordinary chimney flue also referring to the deeds of certain border ruffians he said rapidly paring away his speech like an experienced soldier keeping a reserve of force and meaning they had a perfect right to be hung he was not in the least a rhetorician was not talking to buncombe or his constituents anywhere had no need to invent anything but to tell the simple truth and communicate his own resolution therefore he appeared incomparably strong and eloquence in congress and elsewhere seemed to me at a discount it was like the speeches of cromwell compared with those of an ordinary king as for his tact and prudence i will merely say that at a time when scarcely a man from the free states was able to reach kansas by any direct route at least without having his arms taken from him he carrying what imperfect guns and other weapons he could collect openly and slowly drove an ox cart through missouri apparently in the capacity of a surveyor with his surveying compass exposed in it and so passed unsuspected and had ample opportunity to learn the designs of the enemy for some time after his arrival he still followed the same profession when for instance he saw a knot of the ruffians on the prairie discussing of course the single topic which then occupied their minds he would perhaps take his compass and one of his sons and proceed to run an imaginary line right through the very spot on which that conclave had assembled and when he came up to them he would naturally pause and have some talk with them learning their news and at last all their plans perfectly and having thus completed his real survey he would resume his imaginary one and run on his line till he was out of sight when i expressed surprise that he could live in kansas at all with a price set upon his head and so large a number including the authorities exasperated against him he accounted for it by saying it is perfectly well understood that i will not be taken much of the time for some years he has had to skulk in swamps suffering from poverty and from sickness which was the consequence of exposure befriended only by indians and a few whites but though it might be known that he was lurking in a particular swamp his foes commonly did not care to go in after him he could even come out into a town where there were more border ruffians than free state men and transact some business without delaying long and yet not be molested for said he no little handful of men were willing to undertake it and a large body could not be got together in season as for his recent failure we do not know the facts about it it was evidently far from being a wild and desperate attempt his enemy mr vallandigham is compelled to say that it was among the best planned executed conspiracies that ever failed not to mention his other successes was it a failure or did it show a want of good management to deliver from bondage a dozen human beings and walk off with them by broad daylight for weeks if not months at a leisurely pace through one state after another for half the length of the north conspicuous to all parties with a price set upon his head going into a court room on his way and telling what he had done thus convincing missouri that it was not profitable to try to hold slaves in his neighborhood and this not because the government menials were lenient but because they were afraid of him yet he did not attribute his success foolishly to his star or to any magic he said truly that the reason why such greatly superior numbers quailed before him was as one of his prisoners confessed because they lacked a cause a kind of armor which he and his party never lacked

on ticonderoga in ruins and cast a dream like glance over pictures of the past and scenes of which this spot had been the theatre at first my fancy saw only the stern hills lonely lakes and venerable woods not a tree since their seeds were first scattered over the infant soil had felt the axe but had grown up and flourished through its long generation had fallen beneath the weight of years been buried in green moss and nourished the roots of others as gigantic hark a light paddle dips into the lake a birch canoe glides round the point and an indian chief has passed painted and feather crested armed with a bow of hickory a stone tomahawk and flint headed arrows but the ripple had hardly vanished from the water when a white flag caught the breeze over a castle in the wilderness with frowning ramparts and a hundred cannon there stood a french chevalier commandant of the fortress paying court to a copper colored lady the princess of the land and winning her wild love by the arts which had been successful with parisian dames a war party of french and indians were issuing from the gate to lay waste some village of new england near the fortress there was a group of dancers the merry soldiers footing it with the swart savage maids deeper in the wood some red men were growing frantic around a keg of the fire water and elsewhere a jesuit preached the faith of high cathedrals beneath a canopy of forest boughs and distributed crucifixes to be worn beside english scalps i tried to make a series of pictures from the old french war when fleets were on the lake and armies in the woods and especially of abercrombie s disastrous repulse where thousands of lives were utterly thrown away but being at a loss how to order the battle i chose an evening scene in the barracks after the fortress had surrendered to sir jeffrey amherst what an immense fire blazes on that hearth gleaming on swords bayonets and musket barrels and blending with the hue of the scarlet coats till the whole barrack room is quivering with ruddy light one soldier has thrown himself down to rest after a deer hunt or perhaps a long run through the woods with indians on his trail two stand up to wrestle and are on the point of coming to blows a fifer plays a shrill accompaniment to a drummer s song a strain of light love and bloody war with a chorus thundered forth by twenty voices meantime a veteran in the corner is prosing about dettingen and fontenoy and relates camp traditions of marlborough s battles till his pipe having been roguishly charged with gunpowder makes a terrible explosion under his nose and now they all vanish in a puff of smoke from the chimney i merely glanced at the ensuing twenty years which glided peacefully over the frontier fortress till ethan allen s shout was

the cannon of burgoyne pointing down upon their stronghold from the brow of mount defiance announced a new conqueror of ticonderoga no virgin fortress this forth rushed the motley throng from the

behold only the gray and weed grown ruins they were as peaceful in the sun as a warrior s grave hastening to the rampart i perceived that the signal had been given by the steamboat franklin which landed a passenger from whitehall at the tavern and resumed its progress northward to reach canada the next morning a sloop was pursuing the same track a little skiff had just crossed the ferry while

naturally inclined to scientific study than to linguistic or historical study so that if some science is to be learnt by everybody the amount of such study should be limited to acquiring in one or two sciences knowledge of the scientific method in general so much scientific training is indeed universally desirable because good training of the senses to observe accurately is universally desirable and the collecting comparing and grouping of many facts teach orderliness in thinking and lead up to something which spencer valued highly in education a rational explanation of phenomena science having obtained a foothold in secondary schools and colleges an adequate development of science teaching resulted from the introduction of options or elections for the pupils among numerous different courses in place of a curriculum prescribed for all the elaborate teaching of many sciences was thus introduced the pupil or student saw and recorded for himself used books only as helps and guides in seeing recording and generalising proceeded from the known to the unknown and in short made numerous applications of the doctrines which pervade all spencer s writings on education in the united states these methods were introduced earlier and have been carried farther than in england but within the last few years the changes made in education have been more extensive and rapid in england than in any other country witness the announcements of the new high schools and the re organised grammar schools of such colleges as south kensington armstrong king s the university college london and goldsmiths and of the new municipal universities such as victoria bristol sheffield birmingham liverpool and leeds the new technical schools also illustrate the advent of instruction in applied science as an important element in advanced education such institutions as the seafield park engineering college the city guilds of london institute the city of london college and the battersea polytechnic are instances of the same development some endowed institutions for girls illustrate the same tendencies as for example the bedford college for women and the royal holloway college all these institutions teach sciences in considerable variety and in the way that spencer advocated not so much because they have distinctly accepted his views as because modern industrial and social conditions compel the preparation in science of young people destined for various occupations and services indispensable to modern society the method of the preparation is essentially that which he advocated spencer s propositions to the effect that the study of science was desirable for artisans artists and in general for people who were to get their livings through various skills of hand and eye were received with great incredulity not to say derision particularly when he maintained that some knowledge of the theory which underlies an art was desirable for manual practitioners of the art but the changes of the last fifty years in the practice of the arts and trades may be said to have demonstrated that his views were thoroughly sound the applications of science in the arts and trades have been so numerous and productive that widespread training in science has become indispensable to any nation which means to excel in the manufacturing industries whether of large scale or small scale the extraordinary popularity of evening schools and correspondence schools in the united states rests on the need which young people employed in the various industries of the country feel of obtaining more theoretical knowledge about the physical or chemical processes through which they are earning a livelihood the young men s christian associations in the american cities have become great centres of evening instruction for just such young persons the correspondence schools are teaching hundreds of thousands of young people at work in machine shops mills mines and factories who believe that they can advance themselves in their several occupations by supplementing their elementary education with correspondence courses taken while they are at work earning a livelihood in industries that rest ultimately on applications of science spencer s objection to the constant exercise of authority and compulsion in schools families and the state is felt to day much more widely than it was in when he wrote his essay on moral education his proposal that children should be allowed to suffer the natural consequences of their foolish or wrong acts does not seem to the present generation any more than it did to him to be applicable to very young children who need protection from the undue severity of many natural penalties but the soundness of his general doctrine that it is the true function of parents and teachers to see that children habitually experience the normal consequences of their conduct without putting artificial consequences in place of them now commands the assent of most persons whose minds have been freed from the theological dogmas of original sin and total depravity spencer did not expect the immediate adoption of this principle because society as a whole was not yet humane enough he admitted that the uncontrollable child of ill controlled adults might sometimes have to be scolded or beaten and that these barbarous methods might be perhaps the best preparation such children can have for the barbarous society in which they are presently to play a part he hoped however that the civilised members of society would by and by spontaneously use milder measures and this hope has been realised in good degree with the result that happiness in childhood is much commoner and more constant than it used to be parents and teachers are beginning to realise that self control is a prime object in,1

fertile land which seem to have been formed in this way exist at the present time along the banks of the rhine at various places these plains are all very highly cultivated and are rich and beautiful beyond description to see them however it is necessary to travel over them in a diligence or post chaise or by railway trains for in sailing up and down the river along the margin of them in a steam boat you are not high enough to overlook them you see nothing all the way in these places but a low green bank on each side of the river with a fringe of trees and shrubbery along the margin of it for about one hundred miles of its course however near the central portion of it the river flows through a very wild and mountainous district of country or rather through a district which was once wild though now even in the steepest slopes and declivities it is cultivated like a garden the reason why these mountainous regions are so highly cultivated is because the soil and climate are such that they produce the best and most delicious grapes in the world they have consequently from time immemorial been inhabited by a dense population every foot of ground where there is room for a vine to grow is valuable and where the slope was originally steep and rocky the peasants of former ages have gathered out the rocks and stones and built walls of them to terrace up the land the villages of these peasants too are seen every where nestling in the valleys and clinging to the sides of the hills while the summits of almost all the elevations are crowned with the ruins of old feudal castles built by barons or chiefs or kings or military bishops of ancient times famous in history this picturesque portion of the river which extends from bonn a little above cologne to mayence which towns you will readily find on almost any map of europe was the part which mr george and rollo particularly desired to see when they left switzerland they intended to come down the river and see the scenery in descending but mr george met some friends of his on the frontier who persuaded him to make a short tour with them in germany and so come to the rhine at cologne we can then said he to rollo go up the river and see it in ascending which i think is the best way when we get through all the fine scenery which we shall do at mayence we can then go up to strasbourg and take the railroad there for paris the same way that we came yes said rollo i shall like that rollo liked it simply because it would make the journey longer when at length at the end of the tour in germany our travellers were approaching cologne on the rhine rollo began to look out some miles before they reached it to watch for the first appearance of the town he had been riding in the coup of the diligence with his uncle but now in order that he might see better he had changed his place and taken a seat on the banquette the banquette is a seat on the top of the coach and though it is covered above it is open in front and so it affords an excellent view mr george remained in the coup being very much interested in reading his guide book footnote the stage coaches on the continent of europe are called diligences at length rollo called out to tell his uncle that the city was in view the windows of the coup were open so that by leaning over and looking down he could speak to his uncle without any difficulty mr george was so busy reading his guide book that he paid little attention to what rollo said uncle george said rollo calling louder i can see the city and in the midst of it is a church with a great square tower and something very singular on the top of it mr george still continued his reading there is a spire on the top of the church continued rollo but it is bent down on one side entirely as if it had half blown over o no said mr george still continuing to read it really is said rollo i wish you would look uncle george it is something very singular indeed illustration cologne in sight mr george yielded at length to these importunities and looked out the country around in every direction was one vast plain covered with fields of grain luxuriant and beautiful beyond description it was without any fences or other divisions except such as were produced by different kinds of cultivation so that the view extended interminably in almost every direction there were rows and copses of trees here and there giving variety and life to the view and from among them were sometimes to be seen the spires of distant villages in the distance too in the direction in which rollo pointed lay the town of cologne the roofs of the houses extended over a very wide area and among them there was seen a dark square tower very high and crowned as rollo had said with what seemed to be a spire only it was bent over half way and there it lay at an angle at which no spire could possibly stand what can it mean asked rollo i am sure i do not know said mr george next to rollo on the banquette was seated a young man who had mounted up there about an hour before though rollo had not yet spoken to him rollo now however turned to him and asked him in english if he spoke english the young man smiled and shook his head implying that he did not understand rollo then asked him in french if he spoke french the young man said nein footnote pronounced nine rollo knew that nein was the german

a specie basis and no substitute for it can be devised it should be commenced now and reached at the earliest practicable moment consistent with a fair regard to the interests of the debtor class immediate resumption if practicable would not be desirable it would compel the debtor class to pay beyond their contracts the premium on gold at the date of their purchase and would bring bankruptcy and ruin to thousands fluctuation however in the paper value of the measure of all values gold is detrimental to the interests of trade it makes the man of business an involuntary gambler for in all sales where future payment is to be made both parties speculate as to what will be the value of the currency to be paid and received i earnestly recommend to you then such legislation as will insure a gradual return to specie payments and put an immediate stop to fluctuations in the value of currency the methods to secure the former of these results are as numerous as are the speculators on political economy to secure the latter i see but one way and that is to authorize the treasury to redeem its own paper at a fixed price whenever presented and to withhold from circulation all currency so redeemed until sold again for gold the vast resources of the nation both developed and undeveloped ought to make our credit the best on earth with a less burden of taxation than the citizen has endured for six years past the entire public debt could be paid in ten years but it is not desirable that the people should be taxed to pay it in that time year by year the ability to pay increases in a rapid ratio but the burden of interest ought to be reduced as rapidly as can be done without the violation of contract the public debt is represented in great part by bonds having from five to twenty and from ten to forty years to run bearing interest at the rate of per cent and per cent respectively it is optional with the government to pay these bonds at any period after the expiration of the least time mentioned upon their face the time has already expired when a great part of them may be taken up and is rapidly approaching when all may be it is believed that all which are now due may be replaced by bonds bearing a rate of interest not exceeding per cent and as rapidly as the remainder become due that they may be replaced in the same way to accomplish this it may be necessary to authorize the interest to be paid at either of three or four of the money centers of europe or by any assistant treasurer of the united states at the option of the holder of the bond i suggest this subject for the consideration of congress and also simultaneously with this the propriety of redeeming our currency as before suggested at its market value at the time the law goes into effect increasing the rate at which currency shall be bought and sold from day to day or week to week at the same rate of interest as government pays upon its bonds the subjects of tariff and internal taxation will necessarily receive your attention the revenues of the country are greater than the requirements and may with safety be reduced but as the funding of the debt in a or a per cent loan would reduce annual current expenses largely thus after funding justifying a greater reduction of taxation than would be now expedient i suggest postponement of this question until the next meeting of congress it may be advisable to modify taxation and tariff in instances where unjust or burdensome discriminations are made by the present laws but a general revision of the laws regulating this subject i recommend the postponement of for the present i also suggest the renewal of the tax on incomes but at a reduced rate say of per cent and this tax to expire in three years with the funding of the national debt as here suggested i feel safe in saying that taxes and the revenue from imports may be reduced safely from sixty to eighty millions per annum at once and may be still further reduced from year to year as the resources of the country are developed the report of the secretary of the treasury shows the receipts of the government for the fiscal year ending june to be and the expenditures including interest bounties etc to be the estimates for the ensuing year are more favorable to the government and will no doubt show a much larger decrease of the public debt the receipts in the treasury beyond expenditures have exceeded the amount necessary to place to the credit of the sinking fund as provided by law to lock up the surplus in the treasury and withhold it from circulation would lead to such a contraction of the currency as to cripple trade and seriously affect the prosperity of the country under these circumstances the secretary of the treasury and myself heartily concurred in the propriety of using all the surplus currency in the treasury in the purchase of government bonds thus reducing the interest bearing indebtedness of the country and of submitting to congress the question of the disposition to be made of the bonds so purchased the bonds now held by the treasury amount to about seventy five millions including those belonging to the sinking fund i recommend that the whole be placed to the credit of the sinking fund your attention is respectfully invited to the recommendations of the secretary of the treasury for the creation of the office of commissioner of customs revenue for the increase of salaries to certain classes of officials the substitution of increased national bank circulation to replace the outstanding per cent

her flower pot it was about six inches high the sight of this orange tree interested marco very much for it reminded him of home he had often seen orange trees growing in the parlors and green houses in new york what a pretty little orange tree said marco where did you get it how did you know it was an orange tree said the girl o i know an orange tree well enough replied marco i have seen them many a time where asked the girl in new york said marco did your orange tree come from new york no said the girl i planted an orange seed and it grew from that i ve got a lemon tree too she added but it is a great deal larger the lemon tree grows faster than the orange my lemon tree is so large that i couldn t bring it home very well so i left it in the mill in the mill said marco are you a miller the girl laughed she was a very good humored girl and did not appear to be displeased though it certainly was not quite proper for marco to speak in that manner to a stranger she did not however reply to his question but said after a pause do you know where the montpelier stage is the proper english meaning of the word stage is a portion of the road traveled between one resting place and another but in the united states it is used to mean the carriage being a sort of contraction for stage coach no said marco we are going in that stage i wish it would come along said the girl for i m tired of watching my trunk where is your trunk said marco so the girl pointed out her trunk it was upon the platform of the piazza near those belonging to forester and marco the girl showed marco her name which was mary williams written on a card upon the end of it i ll watch your trunk said marco and you can go in and sit down until the stage comes mary thanked him and went in she was not however quite sure that her baggage was safe intrusted thus to the charge of a strange boy and so she took a seat near the window where she could keep an eye upon it there was a blue chest near these trunks which looked like a sailor s chest and marco being tired of standing sat down upon this chest he had however scarcely taken his seat when he saw a coach with four horses coming round a corner it was driven by a small boy not larger than marco it wheeled up toward the door and came to a stand some men then put on the sailor s chest and the trunks mary williams came out and got into the coach she sat on the back seat forester and marco got in and took their places on the middle seat a young man dressed like a sailor took the front seat at one corner of the coach these were all the passengers that were to get in here when every thing was ready they drove away the stage stopped however in a few minutes at the door of a handsome house in the town and took a gentleman and lady in these new passengers took places on the back seat with mary williams this company rode in perfect silence for some time forester took out a book and began to read the gentleman on the back seat went to sleep mary williams and marco looked out at the windows watching the changing scenery the sailor rode in silence moving his lips now and then as if he were talking to himself but taking no notice of any of the company the coach stopped at the villages which they passed through to exchange the mail and sometimes to take in new passengers in the course of these changes marco got his place shifted to the forward seat by the side of the sailor and he gradually got into conversation with him marco introduced the conversation by asking the sailor if he knew how far it was to montpelier no said the sailor i don t keep any reckoning but i wish we were there why asked marco o i expect the old cart will capsize somewhere among these mountains and break our necks for us marco had observed all the morning that when the coach canted to one side or the other on account of the unevenness of the road the sailor always started and looked anxious as if afraid it was going to be upset he wondered that a man who had been apparently accustomed to the terrible dangers of the seas should be alarmed at the gentle oscillations of a stage coach are you afraid that we shall upset asked marco yes said the sailor over some of these precipices and mountains and then there ll be an end of us the sailor said this in an easy and careless manner as if after all he was not much concerned about the danger still marco was surprised that he should fear it at all he was not aware how much the fears which people feel are occasioned by the mere novelty of the danger which they incur a stage driver who is calm and composed on his box in a dark night and upon dangerous roads will be alarmed by the careening of a ship under a gentle breeze at sea while the sailor who laughs at a gale of wind on the ocean is afraid to ride in a carriage on land an t you a sailor asked marco yes replied his companion i shouldn t think that a man that had been used to the sea would be afraid of upsetting in a coach i m not a man said the sailor what are you said marco i m a boy i m only nineteen years old though i m going to be rated seaman next voyage have you just got back from a voyage asked marco yes said the sailor i ve been round the horn in a whaler from old nantuck and now i m going home to see my mother how long since you ve seen her asked marco o it s four years since i ran away here the sailor began to

and tangible good has resulted from his constant interference in my affairs so that in my distrustful moods i am apt to suspect monsieur du miroir s sympathy to be mere outward show not a whit better nor worse than other people s sympathy nevertheless as mortal man must have something in the guise of sympathy and whether the true metal or merely copper washed is of less moment i choose rather to content myself with monsieur du miroir s such as it is than to seek the sterling coin and perhaps miss even the counterfeit in my age of vanities i have often seen him in the ballroom and might again were i to seek him there we have encountered each other at the tremont theatre where however he took his seat neither in the dress circle pit nor upper regions nor threw a single glance at the stage though the brightest star even fanny kemble herself might be culminating there no this whimsical friend of mine chose to linger in the saloon near one of the large looking glasses which throw back their pictures of the illuminated room he is so full of these unaccountable eccentricities that i never like to notice monsieur du miroir nor to acknowledge the slightest connection with him in places of public resort he however has no scruple about claiming my acquaintance even when his common sense if he had any might teach him that i would as willingly exchange a nod with the old nick it was but the other day that he got into a large brass kettle at the entrance of a hardware store and thrust his head the moment afterwards into a bright new warming pan whence he gave me a most merciless look of recognition he smiled and so did i but these childish tricks make decent people rather shy of monsieur du miroir and subject him to more dead cuts than any other gentleman in town one of this singular person s most remarkable peculiarities is his fondness for water wherein he excels any temperance man whatever his pleasure it must be owned is not so much to drink it in which respect a very moderate quantity will answer his occasions as to souse himself over head and ears wherever he may meet with it perhaps he is a merman or born of a mermaid s marriage with a mortal and thus amphibious by hereditary right like the children which the old river deities or nymphs of fountains gave to earthly love when no cleaner bathing place happened to be at hand i have seen the foolish fellow in a horse pond some times he refreshes himself in the trough of a town pump without caring what the people think about him often while carefully picking my way along the street after a heavy shower i have been scandalized to see monsieur du miroir in full dress paddling from one mud puddle to another and plunging into the filthy depths of each seldom have i peeped into a well without discerning this ridiculous gentleman at the bottom whence he gazes up as through a long telescopic tube and probably makes discoveries among the stars by daylight wandering along lonesome paths or in pathless forests when i have come to virgin fountains of which it would have been pleasant to deem myself the first discoverer i have started to find monsieur du miroir there before me the solitude seemed lonelier for his presence i have leaned from a precipice that frowns over lake george which the french call nature s font of sacramental water and used it in their log churches here and their cathedrals beyond the sea and seen him far below in that pure element at niagara too where i would gladly have forgotten both myself and him i could not help observing my companion in the smooth water on the very verge of the cataract just above the table rock were i to reach the sources of the nile i should expect to meet him there unless he be another ladurlad whose garments the depth of ocean could not moisten it is difficult to conceive how he keeps himself in any decent pickle though i am bound to confess that his clothes seem always as dry and comfortable as my own but as a friend i could wish that he would not so often expose himself in liquor all that i have hitherto related may be classed among those little personal oddities which agreeably diversify the surface of society and though they may sometimes annoy us yet keep our daily intercourse fresher and livelier than if they were done away by an occasional hint however i have endeavored to pave the way for stranger things to come which had they been disclosed at once monsieur du miroir might have been deemed a shadow and myself a person of no veracity and this truthful history a fabulous legend but now that the reader knows me worthy of his confidence i will begin to make him stare to speak frankly then i could bring the most astounding proofs that monsieur du miroir is at least a conjurer if not one of that unearthly tribe with whom

coast and every wave loaded as it is with particles of sand and gravel as it breaks upon the shore does something towards the disintegrating process and thus slowly but surely the hardest rocks are gradually ground down to a powdery substance and the mud thus formed coarser or finer as the case may be is carried by the rush of the tides or currents till it reaches the comparatively deeper parts of the ocean in which it can sink to the bottom that is to parts where there is a depth of about fourteen or fifteen fathoms a depth at which the water is usually nearly motionless and in which of course the finer particles of this detritus or mud as we call it sinks to the bottom or again if you take a river rushing down from its mountain sources brawling over the stones and rocks that intersect its path loosening removing and carrying with it in its downward course the pebbles and lighter matters from its banks it crushes and pounds down the rocks and earths in precisely the same way as the wearing action of the sea waves the matters forming the deposit are torn from the mountain side and whirled impetuously into the valley more slowly over the plain thence into the estuary and from the estuary they are swept into the sea the coarser and heavier fragments are obviously deposited first that is as soon as the current begins to lose its force by becoming amalgamated with the stiller depths of the ocean but the finer and lighter particles are carried further on and eventually deposited in a deeper and stiller portion of the ocean it clearly follows from this that mud gives us a chronology for it is evident that supposing this which i now sketch to be the sea bottom and supposing this to be a coast line from the washing action of the sea upon the rock wearing and grinding it down into a sediment of mud the mud will be carried down and at length deposited in the deeper parts of this sea bottom where it will form a layer and then while that first layer is hardening other mud which is coming from the same source will of course be carried to the same place and as it is quite impossible for it to get beneath the layer already there it deposits itself above it and forms another layer and in that way you gradually have layers of mud constantly forming and hardening one above the other and conveying a record of time it is a necessary result of the operation of the law of gravitation that the uppermost layer shall be the youngest and the lowest the oldest and that the different beds shall be older at any particular point or spot in exactly the ratio of their depth from the surface so that if they were upheaved afterwards and you had a series of these different layers of mud converted into sandstone or limestone as the case might be you might be sure that the bottom layer was deposited first and that the upper layers were formed afterwards here you see is the first step in the history these layers of mud give us an idea of time the whole surface of the earth i speak broadly and leave out minor qualifications is made up of such layers of mud so hard the majority of them that we call them rock whether limestone or sandstone or other varieties of rock and seeing that every part of the crust of the earth is made up in this way you might think that the determination of the chronology the fixing of the time which it has taken to form this crust is a comparatively simple matter take a broad average ascertain how fast the mud is deposited upon the bottom of the sea or in the estuary of rivers take it to be an inch or two or three inches a year or whatever you may roughly estimate it at then take the total thickness of the whole series of stratified rocks which geologists estimate at twelve or thirteen miles or about seventy thousand feet make a sum in short division divide the total thickness by that of the quantity deposited in one year and the result will of course give you the number of years which the crust has taken to form truly that looks a very simple process it would be so except for certain difficulties the very first of which is that of finding how rapidly sediments are deposited but the main difficulty a difficulty which renders any certain calculations of such a matter out of the question is this the sea bottom on which the deposit takes place is continually shifting instead of the surface of the earth being that stable fixed thing that it is popularly believed to be being in common parlance the very emblem of fixity itself it is incessantly moving and is in fact as unstable as the surface of the sea except that its undulations are infinitely slower and enormously higher and deeper now what is the effect of this oscillation take the case to which i have previously referred the finer or coarser sediments that are carried down by the current of the river will only be carried out a certain distance and eventually as we have already seen on reaching the stiller part of the ocean will be deposited at the bottom let c y fig be the sea bottom y d the shore x y the sea level then the coarser deposit will subside over the region b the finer over a while beyond a there will be no deposit at all and consequently no record will be kept simply because no deposit is going on now suppose that the whole land c d which we have regarded as stationary goes down as it does so both a and b go further out from the shore which will be at y x y being the new sea level the consequence will be that the layer of mud a being now for the most part further than the force of the current is strong enough to convey even the finest debris will of course receive no more deposits and having attained a certain thickness will now grow no thicker we should b,2

mrs finn and windbags don t get college scholarships said matilda finn the second daughter but papa always snubs phinny said barbara the youngest i ll snub you if you don t take care said the doctor taking barbara tenderly by the ear for his youngest daughter was the doctor s pet the doctor certainly did not snub his son for he allowed him to go over to london when he was twenty two years of age in order that he might read with an english barrister it was the doctor s wish that his son might be called to the irish bar and the young man s desire that he might go to the english bar the doctor so far gave way under the influence of phineas himself and of all the young women of the family as to pay the usual fee to a very competent and learned gentleman in the middle temple and to allow his son one hundred and fifty pounds per annum for three years dr finn however was still firm in his intention that his son should settle in dublin and take the munster circuit believing that phineas might come to want home influences and home connections in spite of the swanhood which was attributed to him phineas sat his terms for three years and was duly called to the bar but no evidence came home as to the acquirement of any considerable amount of law lore or even as to much law study on the part of the young aspirant the learned pundit at whose feet he had been sitting was not especially loud in praise of his pupil s industry though he did say a pleasant word or two as to his pupil s intelligence phineas himself did not boast much of his own hard work when at home during the long vacation no rumours of expected successes of expected professional successes reached the ears of any of the finn family at killaloe but nevertheless there came tidings which maintained those high ideas in the maternal bosom of which mention has been made and which were of sufficient strength to induce the doctor in opposition to his own judgment to consent to the continued residence of his son in london phineas belonged to an excellent club the reform club and went into very good society he was hand in glove with the hon laurence fitzgibbon the youngest son of lord claddagh he was intimate with barrington erle who had been private secretary one of the private secretaries to the great whig prime minister who was lately in but was now out he had dined three or four times with that great whig nobleman the earl of brentford and he had been assured that if he stuck to the english bar he would certainly do well though he might fail to succeed in court or in chambers he would doubtless have given to him some one of those numerous appointments for which none but clever young barristers are supposed to be fitting candidates the old doctor yielded for another year although at the end of the second year he was called upon to pay a sum of three hundred pounds which was then due by phineas to creditors in london when the doctor s male friends in and about killaloe heard that he had done so they said that he was doting not one of the miss finns was as yet married and after all that had been said about the doctor s wealth it was supposed that there would not be above five hundred pounds a year among them all were he to give up his profession but the doctor when he paid that three hundred pounds for his son buckled to his work again though he had for twelve months talked of giving up the midwifery he buckled to again to the great disgust of dr duggin who at this time said very ill natured things about young phineas at the end of the three years phineas was called to the bar and immediately received a letter from his father asking minutely as to his professional intentions his father recommended him to settle in dublin and promised the one hundred and fifty pounds for three more years on condition that this advice was followed he did not absolutely say that the allowance would be stopped if the advice were not followed but that was plainly to be implied that letter came at the moment of a dissolution of parliament lord de terrier the conservative prime minister who had now been in office for the almost unprecedentedly long period of fifteen months had found that he could not face continued majorities against him in the house of commons and had dissolved the house rumour declared that he would have much preferred to resign and betake himself once again to the easy glories of opposition but his party had naturally been obdurate with him and he had resolved to appeal to the country when phineas received his father s letter it had just been suggested to him at the reform club that he should stand for the irish borough of loughshane this proposition had taken phineas finn so much by surprise that when first made to him by barrington erle it took his breath away what he stand for parliament twenty four years old with no vestige of property belonging to him without a penny in his purse as completely dependent on his father as he was when he first went to school at eleven years of age and for loughshane a little borough in the county galway for which a brother of that fine old irish peer the earl of tulla had been sitting for the last twenty years a fine high minded representative of the thorough going orange protestant feeling of ireland and the earl of tulla to whom almost all loughshane belonged or at any rate the land about loughshane was one of his father s staunchest friends loughshane is in county galway but the earl of tulla usually lived at his seat in county clare not more than ten miles from killaloe and always confided his gouty feet and the weak nerves of the old countess and the stomachs of all his domestics to the care of dr finn how was it possible that phineas should stand,2

understandings against the hostility of their feelings and practical tendencies and truly the understandings of the majority of mankind would need to be much better cultivated than has ever yet been the case before they can be asked to place such reliance in their own power of estimating arguments as to give up practical principles in which they have been born and bred and which are the basis of much of the existing order of the world at the first argumentative attack which they are not capable of logically resisting i do not therefore quarrel with them for having too little faith in argument but for having too much faith in custom and the general feeling it is one of the characteristic prejudices of the reaction of the nineteenth century against the eighteenth to accord to the unreasoning elements in human nature the infallibility which the eighteenth century is supposed to have ascribed to the reasoning elements for the apotheosis of reason we have substituted that of instinct and we call everything instinct which we find in ourselves and for which we cannot trace any rational foundation this idolatry infinitely more degrading than the other and the most pernicious of the false worships of the present day of all of which it is now the main support will probably hold its ground until it gives way before a sound psychology laying bare the real root of much that is bowed down to as the intention of nature and the ordinance of god as regards the present question i am willing to accept the unfavourable conditions which the prejudice assigns to me i consent that established custom and the general feeling should be deemed conclusive against me unless that custom and feeling from age to age can be shown to have owed their existence to other causes than their soundness and to have derived their power from the worse rather than the better parts of human nature i am willing that judgment should go against me unless i can show that my judge has been tampered with the concession is not so great as it might appear for to prove this is by far the easiest portion of my task the generality of a practice is in some cases a strong presumption that it is or at all events once was conducive to laudable ends this is the case when the practice was first adopted or afterwards kept up as a means to such ends and was grounded on experience of the mode in which they could be most effectually attained if the authority of men over women when first established had been the result of a conscientious comparison between different modes of constituting the government of society if after trying various other modes of social organization the government of women over men equality between the two and such mixed and divided modes of government as might be invented it had been decided on the testimony of experience that the mode in which women are wholly under the rule of men having no share at all in public concerns and each in private being under the legal obligation of obedience to the man with whom she has associated her destiny was the arrangement most conducive to the happiness and well being of both its general adoption might then be fairly thought to be some evidence that at the time when it was adopted if was the best though even then the considerations which recommended it may like so many other primeval social facts of the greatest importance have subsequently in the course of ages ceased to exist but the state of the case is in every respect the reverse of this in the first place the opinion in favour of the present system which entirely subordinates the weaker sex to the stronger rests upon theory only for there never has been trial made of any other so that experience in the sense in which it is vulgarly opposed to theory cannot be pretended to have pronounced any verdict and in the second place the adoption of this system of inequality never was the result of deliberation or forethought or any social ideas or any notion whatever of what conduced to the benefit of humanity or the good order of society it arose simply from the fact that from the very earliest twilight of human society every woman owing to the value attached to her by men combined with her inferiority in muscular strength was found in a state of bondage to some man laws and systems of polity always begin by recognising the relations they find already existing between individuals they convert what was a mere physical fact into a legal right give it the sanction of society and principally aim at the substitution of public and organized means of asserting and protecting these rights instead of the irregular and lawless conflict of physical strength those who had already been compelled to obedience became in this manner legally bound to it slavery from being a mere affair of force between the master and the slave became regularized and a matter of compact among the masters who binding themselves to one another for common protection guaranteed by their collective strength the private possessions of each including his slaves in early times the great majority of the male sex were slaves as well as the whole of the female and many ages elapsed some of them ages of high cultivation before any thinker was bold enough to question the rightfulness and the absolute social necessity either of the one slavery or of the other by degrees such thinkers did arise and the general progress of society assisting the slavery of the male sex has in all the countries of christian europe at least though in one of them only within the last few years been at length abolished and that of the female sex has been gradually changed into a milder form of dependence but this dependence as it exists at present is not an original

sequel will show the way i came by it was this when our frigate lay in callao on the coast of peru her last harbour in the pacific i found myself without a grego or sailor s surtout and as toward the end of a three years cruise no pea jackets could be had from the purser s steward and being bound for cape horn some sort of a substitute was indispensable i employed myself for several days in manufacturing an outlandish garment of my own devising to shelter me from the boisterous weather we were so soon to encounter it was nothing more than a white duck frock or rather shirt which laying on deck i folded double at the bosom and by then making a continuation of the slit there opened it lengthwise much as you would cut a leaf in the last new novel the gash being made a metamorphosis took place transcending any related by ovid for presto the shirt was a coat a strange looking coat to be sure of a quakerish amplitude about the skirts with an infirm tumble down collar and a clumsy fullness about the wristbands and white yea white as a shroud and my shroud it afterward came very near proving as he who reads further will find but bless me my friend what sort of a summer jacket is this in which to weather cape horn a very tasty and beautiful white linen garment it may have seemed but then people almost universally sport their linen next to their skin very true and that thought very early occurred to me for no idea had i of scudding round cape horn in my shirt for that would have been almost scudding under bare poles indeed so with many odds and ends of patches old socks old trowser legs and the like i bedarned and bequilted the inside of my jacket till it became all over stiff and padded as king james s cotton stuffed and dagger proof doublet and no buckram or steel hauberk stood up more stoutly so far very good but pray tell me white jacket how do you propose keeping out the rain and the wet in this quilted grego of yours you don t call this wad of old patches a mackintosh do you you don t pretend to say that worsted is water proof no my dear friend and that was the deuce of it waterproof it was not no more than a sponge indeed with such recklessness had i bequilted my jacket that in a rain storm i became a universal absorber swabbing bone dry the very bulwarks i leaned against of a damp day my heartless shipmates even used to stand up against me so powerful was the capillary attraction between this luckless jacket of mine and all drops of moisture i dripped like a turkey a roasting and long after the rain storms were over and the sun showed his face i still stalked a scotch mist and when it was fair weather with others alas it was foul weather with me me ah me soaked and heavy what a burden was that jacket to carry about especially when i was sent up aloft dragging myself up step by step as if i were weighing the anchor small time then to strip and wring it out in a rain when no hanging back or delay was permitted no no up you go fat or lean lambert or edson never mind how much avoirdupois you might weigh and thus in my own proper person did many showers of rain reascend toward the skies in accordance with the natural laws but here be it known that i had been terribly disappointed in carrying out my original plan concerning this jacket it had been my intention to make it thoroughly impervious by giving it a coating of paint but bitter fate ever overtakes us unfortunates so much paint had been stolen by the sailors in daubing their overhaul trowsers and tarpaulins that by the time i an honest man had completed my quiltings the paint pots were banned and put under strict lock and key said old brush the captain of the paint room look ye white jacket said he ye can t have any paint such then was my jacket a well

fertile land which seem to have been formed in this way exist at the present time along the banks of the rhine at various places these plains are all very highly cultivated and are rich and beautiful beyond description to see them however it is necessary to travel over them in a diligence or post chaise or by railway trains for in sailing up and down the river along the margin of them in a steam boat you are not high enough to overlook them you see nothing all the way in these places but a low green bank on each side of the river with a fringe of trees and shrubbery along the margin of it for about one hundred miles of its course however near the central portion of it the river flows through a very wild and mountainous district of country or rather through a district which was once wild though now even in the steepest slopes and declivities it is cultivated like a garden the reason why these mountainous regions are so highly cultivated is because the soil and climate are such that they produce the best and most delicious grapes in the world they have consequently from time immemorial been inhabited by a dense population every foot of ground where there is room for a vine to grow is valuable and where the slope was originally steep and rocky the peasants of former ages have gathered out the rocks and stones and built walls of them to terrace up the land the villages of these peasants too are seen every where nestling in the valleys and clinging to the sides of the hills while the summits of almost all the elevations are crowned with the ruins of old feudal castles built by barons or chiefs or kings or military bishops of ancient times famous in history this picturesque portion of the river which extends from bonn a little above cologne to mayence which towns you will readily find on almost any map of europe was the part which mr george and rollo particularly desired to see when they left switzerland they intended to come down the river and see the scenery in descending but mr george met some friends of his on the frontier who persuaded him to make a short tour with them in germany and so come to the rhine at cologne we can then said he to rollo go up the river and see it in ascending which i think is the best way when we get through all the fine scenery which we shall do at mayence we can then go up to strasbourg and take the railroad there for paris the same way that we came yes said rollo i shall like that rollo liked it simply because it would make the journey longer when at length at the end of the tour in germany our travellers were approaching cologne on the rhine rollo began to look out some miles before they reached it to watch for the first appearance of the town he had been riding in the coup of the diligence with his uncle but now in order that he might see better he had changed his place and taken a seat on the banquette the banquette is a seat on the top of the coach and though it is covered above it is open in front and so it affords an excellent view mr george remained in the coup being very much interested in reading his guide book footnote the stage coaches on the continent of europe are called diligences at length rollo called out to tell his uncle that the city was in view the windows of the coup were open so that by leaning over and looking down he could speak to his uncle without any difficulty mr george was so busy reading his guide book that he paid little attention to what rollo said uncle george said rollo calling louder i can see the city and in the midst of it is a church with a great square tower and something very singular on the top of it mr george still continued his reading there is a spire on the top of the church continued rollo but it is bent down on one side entirely as if it had half blown over o no said mr george still continuing to read it really is said rollo i wish you would look uncle george it is something very singular indeed illustration cologne in sight mr george yielded at length to these importunities and looked out the country around in every direction was one vast plain covered with fields of grain luxuriant and beautiful beyond description it was without any fences or other divisions except such as were produced by different kinds of cultivation so that the view extended interminably in almost every direction there were rows and copses of trees here and there giving variety and life to the view and from among them were sometimes to be seen the spires of distant villages in the distance too in the direction in which rollo pointed lay the town of cologne the roofs of the houses extended over a very wide area and among them there was seen a dark square tower very high and crowned as rollo had said with what seemed to be a spire only it was bent over half way and there it lay at an angle at which no spire could possibly stand what can it mean asked rollo i am sure i do not know said mr george next to rollo on the banquette was seated a young man who had mounted up there about an hour before though rollo had not yet spoken to him rollo now however turned to him and asked him in english if he spoke english the young man smiled and shook his head implying that he did not understand rollo then asked him in french if he spoke french the young man said nein footnote pronounced nine rollo knew that nein was the german

across the river from side to side the town is filled with magnificent churches and palaces built some of them a thousand years ago and all so richly adorned with sculptures paintings bronzes and mosaics that the whole world flock there to see them people go there chiefly in the winter at that season the town is crowded with strangers a great many people too go there in the winter to avoid the cold weather which prevails at that time of the year in all the more northerly countries of europe there is so little winter in florence that few of the houses have any fireplaces in them except in the kitchen when there comes a cold day the people warm themselves by means of a jug or jar of earthen ware with a handle passing over across the top by which they carry it about they fill these jars half full of hot embers and so carry them with them wherever they want to go the women when they sit down put the jar under their dresses on the floor or pavement beneath them and the men place it right before them between their feet you will see market women and flower girls sitting in the corners of the streets in the winter attending to their business and keeping themselves warm all the time with these little fire jars and artists in the palaces and picture galleries each with one of them by his side or close before him while he is at work copying the works of the great masters or making drawings from the antique statues there is another very curious use that the people of florence make of these jars and that is they warm the beds with them when any body is sick so as to require this indulgence you would think it very difficult to warm a bed with an open jar filled with burning embers the way they do it is this they hang the jar in the inside of a sort of wooden cage shaped like a bushel basket and about as large they turn this cage upside down and hang the jar up in it by means of a hook depending inside they turn down the bed clothes and put the cage in it jar of coals and all they then put back the bed clothes and cover the cage all up they leave it so for a quarter of an hour and then carefully turning the clothes down again they take the jar out and the bed is warmed but to return to mr george and rollo they engaged a vetturino for the first time at florence mr george had gone to florence chiefly for the purpose of examining the immense collections of paintings and statuary which exist there rollo went not on account of the paintings or statues for he did not care much about such things but because he liked to go any where where he could see new places and be entertained by new scenes accordingly while mr george was at work in the galleries of florence studying by the help of catalogues the famous specimens of ancient art rollo was usually rambling about the streets observing the manners and customs of the people and watching the singular and curious scenes that every where met his eye the reason why there are so many paintings and sculptures in italy is this in the middle ages it was the fashion in all the central parts of europe for the people to spend almost all their surplus money in building and decorating churches indeed there was then very little else that they could do at the present time people invest their funds as fast as they accumulate them in building ships and railroads docks for the storage of merchandise houses and stores in cities to let for the sake of the rent and country seats or pretty private residences of various kinds for themselves but in the middle ages very little could be done in the way of investments like these there were no railroads and there was very little use for ships there was no profit to be gained by building houses and stores for there were so many wars and commotions among the people of the different towns and kingdoms that nothing was stable or safe for the same reason it was useless for men to spend their money in building and ornamenting their own houses for at the first approach of an enemy the town in which they lived was likely to be sacked and their houses and all the fine furniture which they might contain would be burned or destroyed but the churches were safe the people of the different countries had so much veneration for sacred places and for every thing connected with religion that they were afraid to touch or injure any thing that had been consecrated to a religious use to plunder a church or a convent or an abbey or to do any thing to injure or destroy the property that they contained was regarded as sacrilege and sacrilege they deemed a dreadful crime abhorred by god and man thus while they would burn and destroy hundreds of dwellings without any remorse and turn the wretched inmates out at midnight into the streets to die of exposure terror and despair they would stop at once when they came to the church afraid to harm it in any way or to touch the least thing that it contained accordingly while every thing else in a conquered town was doomed to the most reckless destruction all that was in the church the most delicate paintings and the most costly gold and silver images and utensils were as safe as if they were surrounded by impregnable castle walls of course these notions were very mistaken ones according to the teachings of our lord and saviour jesus christ it must be a greater sin to burn down the cottage of a poor widow and turn her out at midnight into the streets to die than to plunder for gain the richest altar in the world from these and various other similar causes it happened that in the middle ages that is from five hundred to a thousand years ago almost all the great expenditures of money in all the great cities and towns of europe were made for churches sometimes these churches were so lar,2

is anything else but a place where boys are roasted alive and so with tears and taunts and supplications the point of private education was conceded at length it was resolved that the only hope should remain at home a season until some plan should be devised for the cultivation of his promising understanding during this year vivian became a somewhat more constant intruder into the library than heretofore and living so much among books he was insensibly attracted to those silent companions that speak so eloquently how far the character of the parent may influence the character of the child the metaphysician must decide certainly the character of vivian grey underwent at this period of his life a sensible change doubtless constant communion with a mind highly refined severely cultivated and much experienced cannot but produce a beneficial impression even upon a mind formed and upon principles developed how infinitely more powerful must the influence of such communion be upon a youthful heart ardent innocent and unpractised as vivian was not to figure in the microcosm of a public school a place for which from his temper he was almost better fitted than any young genius whom the playing fields of eton or the hills of winton can remember there was some difficulty in fixing upon his future academus mr grey s two axioms were first that no one so young as his son should settle in the metropolis and that vivian must consequently not have a private tutor and secondly that all private schools were quite worthless and therefore there was every probability of vivian not receiving any education whatever at length an exception to axiom second started up in the establishment of mr dallas this gentleman was a clergyman a profound grecian and a poor man he had edited the

last exclamation was however a scandalous libel for certainly no being ever stood in a pedagogue s presence with more perfect sang froid and with a bolder front than did at this moment vivian grey one principle in mr dallas s system was always to introduce a new comer in school hours he was thus carried immediately in medias res and the curiosity of his co mates being in a great degree satisfied at the time when that curiosity could not personally annoy him the new comer was of course much better prepared to make his way when the absence of the ruler became a signal for some oral communication with the arrival however in the present instance the young savages at burnsley vicarage had caught a tartar and in a very few days vivian grey was decidedly the most popular fellow in the school he

to themselves and each will have a misgiving that the portrait is his own the author s object in calling public attention to the system would be very imperfectly fulfilled if he did not state now in his own person emphatically and earnestly that mr squeers and his school are faint and feeble pictures of an existing reality purposely subdued and kept down lest they should be deemed impossible that there are upon record trials at law in which damages have been sought as a poor recompense for lasting agonies and disfigurements inflicted upon children by the treatment of the master in these places involving such offensive and foul details of neglect cruelty and disease as no writer of fiction would have the boldness to imagine and that since he has been engaged upon these adventures he has received from private quarters far beyond the reach of suspicion or distrust accounts of atrocities in the perpetration of which upon neglected or repudiated children these schools have been the main instruments very far exceeding any that appear in these pages this comprises all i need say on the subject except that if i had seen occasion i had resolved to reprint a few of these details of legal proceedings from certain old newspapers one other quotation from the same preface may serve to introduce a fact that my readers may think curious to turn to a more pleasant subject it may be right to say that there are two characters in this book which are drawn from life it is remarkable that what we call the world which is so very credulous in what professes to be true is most incredulous in what professes to be imaginary and that while every day in real life it will allow in one man no blemishes and in another no virtues it will seldom admit a very strongly marked character either good or bad in a fictitious narrative to be within the limits of probability but those who take an interest in this tale will be glad to learn that the brothers cheeryble live that their liberal charity their singleness of heart their noble nature and their unbounded benevolence are no creations of the author s brain but are prompting every day and oftenest by stealth some munificent and generous deed in that town of which they are the pride and honour if i were to attempt to sum up the thousands of letters from all sorts of people in all sorts of latitudes and climates which this unlucky paragraph brought down upon me i should get into an arithmetical difficulty from which i could not easily extricate myself suffice it to say that i believe the applications for loans gifts and offices of profit that i have been requested to forward to the originals of the brothers cheeryble with whom i never interchanged any communication in my life would have exhausted the combined patronage of all the lord chancellors since the accession of the house of brunswick and would have broken the rest of the bank of england the brothers are now dead there is only one other point on which i would desire to offer a remark if nicholas be not always found to be blameless or agreeable he is not always intended to appear so he is a young man of an impetuous temper and of little or no experience and i saw no reason why such a hero should be lifted out of nature chapter introduces all the rest there once lived in a sequestered part of the county of devonshire one mr godfrey nickleby a worthy gentleman who taking it into his head rather late in life that he must get married and not being young enough or rich enough to aspire to the hand of a lady of fortune had wedded an old flame out of mere attachment who in her turn had taken him for the same reason thus two people who cannot afford to play cards for money sometimes sit down to a quiet game for love some ill conditioned persons who sneer at the life matrimonial may perhaps suggest in this place that the good couple would be better likened to two principals in a sparring match who when fortune is low,2

poetic intensity became all at once rhetorical hyperbole i might suspect his thermometer as indeed i did for we harvard men are apt to think ill of any graduation but our own but it was a poor consolation the fact remained that his herald mercury standing a tiptoe could look down on mine i seem to glimpse something of this familiar weakness in mr white he too has shared in these mercurial triumphs and defeats nor do i doubt that he had a true country gentleman s interest in the weather cock that his first question on coming down of a morning was like barabas s into what quarter peers my halcyon s bill it is an innocent and healthful employment of the mind distracting one from too continual study of himself and leading him to dwell rather upon the indigestions of the elements than his own did the wind back round or go about with the sun is a rational question that bears not remotely on the making of hay and the prosperity of crops i have little doubt that the regulated observation of the vane in many different places and the interchange of results by telegraph would put the weather as it were in our power by betraying its ambushes before it is ready to give the assault at first sight nothing seems more drolly trivial than the lives of those whose single achievement is to record the wind and the temperature three times a day yet such men are doubtless sent into the world for this special end and perhaps there is no kind of accurate observation whatever its object that has not its final use and value for some one or other it is even to be hoped that the speculations of our newspaper editors and their myriad correspondence upon the signs of the political atmosphere may also fill their appointed place in a well regulated universe if it be only that of supplying so many more jack o lanterns to the future historian nay the observations on finance of an m c whose sole knowledge of the subject has been derived from a life long success in getting a living out of the public without paying any equivalent therefor will perhaps be of interest hereafter to some explorer of our cloaca maxima whenever it is cleansed for many years i have been in the habit of noting down some of the leading events of my embowered solitude such as the coming of certain birds and the like a kind of memoires pour servir after the fashion of white rather than properly digested natural history i thought it not impossible that a few simple stories of my winged acquaintances might be found entertaining by persons of kindred taste there is a common notion that animals are better meteorologists than men and i have little doubt that in immediate weather wisdom they have the advantage of our sophisticated senses though i suspect a sailor or shepherd would be their match but i have seen nothing that leads me to believe their minds capable of erecting the horoscope of a whole season and letting us know beforehand whether the winter will be severe or the summer rainless i more than suspect that the clerk of the weather himself does not always know very long in advance whether he is to draw an order for hot or cold dry or moist and the musquash is scarce likely to be wiser i have noted but two days difference in the coming of the song sparrow between a very early and a very backward spring this very year i saw the linnets at work thatching just before a snow storm which covered the ground several inches deep for a number of days they struck work and left us for a while no doubt in search of food birds frequently perish from sudden changes in our whimsical spring weather of which they had no foreboding more than thirty years ago a cherry tree then in full bloom near my window was covered with humming birds benumbed by a fall of mingled rain and snow which probably killed many of them it should seem that their coming was dated by the height of the sun which betrays them into unthrifty matrimony so priketh hem nature in hir corages but their going is another matter the chimney swallows leave us early for example apparently so soon as their latest fledglings are firm enough of wing to attempt the long rowing match that is before them on the other hand the wild geese probably do not leave the north till they are frozen out for i have heard their bugles sounding southward so late as the middle of december what may be called local migrations are doubtless dictated by the chances of food i have once been visited by large flights of cross bills and whenever the snow lies long and deep on the ground a flock of cedar birds comes in mid winter to eat the berries on my hawthorns i have never been quite able to fathom the local or rather geographical partialities of birds never before this summer have the king birds handsome,1

with embossings of gold borne over him and was guarded with twelve lances from the waist to the ground was all cloth of gold and that very rich in the attire of his head were finely wreathed in diverse rings of plaited gold of an inch or more in breadth which made a fair and princely show somewhat resembling a crown in form about his neck he had a chain of perfect gold the links very great and one fold double on his left hand was a diamond an emerald a ruby and a turky on his right hand in one ring a big and perfect turky and in another ring many diamonds of a smaller size all this glitter of barbaric gold was the produce of the spice trade of which the sultans kept the monopoly and by which they became wealthy ternate with the small islands in a line south of it as far as batchian constitute the ancient moluccas the native country of the clove as well as the only part in which it was cultivated nutmegs and mace were procured from the natives of new guinea and the adjacent islands where they grew wild and the profits on spice cargoes were so enormous that the european traders were glad to give gold and jewels and the finest manufactures of europe or of india in exchange when the dutch established their influence in these seas and relieved the native princes from their portuguese oppressors they saw that the easiest way to repay themselves would be to get this spice trade into their own hands for this purpose they adopted the wise principle of concentrating the culture of these valuable products in those spots only of which they could have complete control to do this effectually it was necessary to abolish the culture and trade in all other places which they succeeded in doing by treaty with the native rulers these agreed to have all the spice trees in their possessions destroyed they gave up large though fluctuating revenues but they gained in return a fixed subsidy freedom from the constant attacks and harsh oppressions of the portuguese and a continuance of their regal power and exclusive authority over their own subjects which is maintained in all the islands except ternate to this day it is no doubt supposed by most englishmen who have been accustomed to look upon this act of the dutch with vague horror as something utterly unprincipled and barbarous that the native population suffered grievously by this destruction of such valuable property but it is certain that this was not the case the sultans kept this lucrative trade entirely in their own hands as a rigid monopoly and they would take care not to give their subjects more than would amount to their usual wages while they would surely exact as large a quantity of spice as they could possibly obtain drake and other early voyagers always seem to have purchased their spice cargoes from the sultans and rajahs and not from the cultivators now the absorption of so much labour in the cultivation of this one product must necessarily have raised the price of food and other necessaries and when it was abolished more rice would be grown more sago made more fish caught and more tortoise shell rattan gum dammer and other valuable products of the seas and the forests would be obtained i believe therefore that this abolition of the spice trade in the moluccas was actually beneficial to the inhabitants and that it was an act both wise in itself and morally and politically justifiable in the selection of the places in which to carry on the cultivation the dutch were not altogether fortunate or wise banda was chosen for nutmegs and was eminently successful since it continues to this day to produce a large supply of this spice and to yield a considerable revenue amboyna was fixed upon for establishing the clove cultivation but the soil and climate although apparently very similar to that of its native islands is not favourable and for some years the government have actually been paying to the cultivators a higher rate than they could purchase cloves elsewhere owing to a great fall in the price since the rate of payment was fixed for a term of years by the dutch government and which rate is still most honourably paid in walking about the suburbs of ternate we find everywhere the ruins of massive stone and brick buildings gateways and arches showing at once the superior wealth of the ancient town and the destructive effects of earthquakes it was during my second stay in the town after my return from new guinea that i first felt an earthquake it was a very slight one scarcely more than has been felt in this country but occurring in a place that lad been many times destroyed by them it was rather more exciting i had just awoke at gun fire a m when suddenly the thatch began to rustle and shake as if an army of cats were galloping over it and immediately afterwards my bed shook too so that for an instant i imagined myself back in new guinea in my fragile house which shook when an old cock went to roost on the ridge but remembering that i was now on a solid earthen floor i said to myself why it s an earthquake and lay still in the pleasing expectation of another shock but none came and this was the only earthquake i ever felt in ternate the last great one was in february when almost every house in the place was destroyed it began about midnight on the chinese new year s festival at which time every one stays up nearly all night feasting at the chinamen s houses and seeing the processions this prevented any lives being lost as every one ran out of doors at the first shock which was not very severe the second a few minutes afterwards threw down a great many houses and others which continued all night and part of the next day completed the devastation the line of disturbance was very

the discharge of his duties by two inferior officers chosen from the alumni of the college who while they imparted to others the knowledge they had already imbibed pursued the study of divinity under the direction of their principal under such auspices the institution grew and flourished having at that time but two rivals in the country neither of them within a considerable distance it became the general resort of the youth of the province in which it was situated for several years in succession its students amounted to nearly fifty a number which relatively to the circumstances of the country was very considerable from the exterior of the collegians an accurate observer might pretty safely judge how long they had been inmates of those classic walls the brown cheeks and the rustic dress of some would inform him that they had but recently left the plough to labor in a not less toilsome field the grave look and the intermingling of garments of a more classic cut would distinguish those who had begun to acquire the polish of their new residence and the air of superiority the paler cheek the less robust form the spectacles of green and the dress in general of threadbare black would designate the highest class who were understood to have acquired nearly all the science their alma mater could bestow and to be on the point of assuming their stations in the world there were it is true exceptions to this general description a few young men had found their way hither from the distant seaports and these were the models of fashion to their rustic companions over whom they asserted a superiority in exterior accomplishments which the fresh though unpolished intellect of the sons of the forest denied them in their literary competitions a third class differing widely from both the former consisted of a few young descendants of the aborigines to whom an impracticable philanthropy was endeavoring to impart the benefits of civilization if this institution did not offer all the advantages of elder and prouder seminaries its deficiencies were compensated to its students by the inculcation of regular habits and of a deep and awful sense of religion which seldom deserted them in their course through life the mild and gentle rule of dr melmoth like that of a father over his children was more destructive to vice than a sterner sway and though youth is never without its follies they have seldom been more harmless than they were here the students indeed ignorant of their own bliss sometimes wished to hasten the time of their entrance on the business of life but they found in after years that many of their happiest remembrances many of the scenes which they would with least reluctance live over again referred to the seat of their early studies the exceptions to this remark were chiefly those whose vices had drawn down even from that paternal government a weighty retribution dr melmoth at the time when he is to be introduced to the reader had borne the matrimonial yoke and in his case it was no light burden nearly twenty years the blessing of children however had been denied him a circumstance which he was accustomed to consider as one of the sorest trials that checkered his pathway for he was a man of a kind and affectionate heart that was continually seeking objects to rest itself upon he was inclined to believe also that a common offspring would have exerted a meliorating influence on the temper of mrs melmoth the character of whose domestic government often compelled him to call to mind such portions of the wisdom of antiquity as relate to the proper endurance of the shrewishness of woman but domestic comforts as well as comforts of every other kind have their drawbacks and so long as the balance is on the side of happiness a wise man will not murmur such was the opinion of dr melmoth and with a little aid from philosophy and more from religion he journeyed on contentedly through life when the storm was loud by the parlor hearth he had always a sure and quiet retreat in his study and there in his deep though not always useful labors he soon forgot whatever of disagreeable nature pertained to his situation this small and dark apartment was the only portion of the house to which since one firmly repelled invasion mrs melmoth s omnipotence did not extend here to reverse the words of queen elizabeth there was but one master and no mistress and that man has little right to complain who possesses so much as one corner in the world where he may be happy or miserable as best suits him in his study then the doctor was accustomed to spend most of the hours that were unoccupied by the duties of his station the flight of time was here as swift as the wind and noiseless as the snow flake and it was a sure proof of real happiness that night often came upon the student before he knew it was midday dr melmoth was wearing towards age having lived nearly sixty years when he was called upon to assume a character to which he had as yet been a stranger he had possessed in his youth a very dear friend with whom his education had associated him and who in his early manhood had been his chief intimate circumstances however had separated them for nearly thirty years half of which had been spent by his friend who was engaged in mercantile pursuits in a foreign country the doctor had nevertheless retained a warm interest

forgiven him his face was still buried in the clothes when the door of the bedroom opened noiselessly and mr harding entered with a velvet step mr harding s attendance at that bedside had been nearly as constant as that of the archdeacon and his ingress and egress was as much a matter of course as that of his son in law he was standing close beside the archdeacon before he was perceived and would also have knelt in prayer had he not feared that his doing so might have caused some sudden start and have disturbed the dying man dr grantly however instantly perceived him and rose from his knees as he did so mr harding took both his hands and pressed them warmly there was more fellowship between them at that moment than there had ever been before and it so happened that after circumstances greatly preserved the feeling as they stood there pressing each other s hands the tears rolled freely down their cheeks god bless you my dears said the bishop with feeble voice as he woke god bless you may god bless you both my dear children and so he died there was no loud rattle in the throat no dreadful struggle no palpable sign of death but the lower jaw fell a little from its place and the eyes which had been so constantly closed in sleep now remained fixed and open neither mr harding nor dr grantly knew that life was gone though both suspected it i believe it s all over said mr harding still pressing the other s hands i think nay i hope it is i will ring the bell said the other speaking all but in a whisper mrs phillips should be here mrs phillips the nurse was soon in the room and immediately with practised hand closed those staring eyes it s all over mrs phillips asked mr harding my lord s no more said mrs phillips turning round and curtseying low with solemn face his lordship s gone more like a sleeping babby than any that i ever saw it s a great relief archdeacon said mr harding a great relief dear good excellent old man oh that our last moments may be as innocent and as peaceful as his surely said mrs phillips the lord be praised for all his mercies but for a meek mild gentle spoken christian his lordship was and mrs phillips with unaffected but easy grief put up her white apron to her flowing eyes you cannot but rejoice that it is over said mr harding still consoling his friend the archdeacon s mind however had already travelled from the death chamber to the closet of the prime minister he had brought himself to pray for his father s life but now that that life was done minutes were too precious to be lost it was now useless to dally with the fact of the bishop s death useless to lose perhaps everything for the pretence of a foolish sentiment but how was he to act while his father in law stood there holding his hand how without appearing unfeeling was he to forget his father in the bishop to overlook what he had lost and think only of what he might possibly gain no i suppose not said he at last in answer to mr harding we have all expected it so long mr harding took him by the arm and led him from the room we will see him again to morrow morni,2

a sure sign of the revolving movement i will assume that it made at least one revolution during the first twenty four hours early the next morning its position was marked and it made a second revolution in hrs during the latter part of this revolution it moved much quicker and the third circle was performed in the evening in a little over hrs as on the succeeding morning i found that the shoot revolved in hrs m it must have made during the night four revolutions each at the average rate of a little over hrs i should add that the temperature of the room varied only a little the shoot had now grown inches in length and carried at its extremity a young internode inch in length which showed slight changes in its curvature the next or ninth revolution was effected in hrs m from this time forward the revolutions were easily observed the thirty sixth revolution was performed at the usual rate so was the last or thirty seventh but it was not completed for the internode suddenly became upright and after moving to the centre remained motionless i tied a weight to its upper end so as to bow it slightly and thus detect any movement but there was none some time before the last revolution was half performed the lower part of the internode ceased to move a few more remarks will complete all that need be said about this internode it moved during five days but the more rapid movements after the performance of the third revolution lasted during three days and twenty hours the regular revolutions from the ninth to thirty sixth inclusive were effected at the average rate of hrs m but the weather was cold and this affected the temperature of the room especially during the night and consequently retarded the rate of movement a little there was only one irregular movement which consisted in the stem rapidly making after an unusually slow revolution only the segment of a circle after the seventeenth revolution the internode had grown from to inches in length and carried an internode inch long which was just perceptibly moving and this carried a very minute ultimate internode after the twenty first revolution the penultimate internode was inches long and probably revolved in a period of about three hours at the twenty seventh revolution the lower and still moving internode was the penultimate and the ultimate inches in length and the inclination of the whole shoot was such that a circle inches in diameter was swept by it when the movement ceased the lower internode was inches and the penultimate inches in length so that from the twenty seventh to thirty seventh revolutions inclusive three internodes were at the same time revolving the lower internode when it ceased revolving became upright and rigid but as the whole shoot was left to grow unsupported it became after a time bent into a nearly horizontal position the uppermost and growing internodes still revolving at the extremity but of course no longer round the old central point of the supporting stick from the changed position of the centre of gravity of the extremity as it revolved a slight and slow swaying movement was given to the long horizontally projecting shoot and this movement i at first thought was a spontaneous one as the shoot grew it hung down more and more whilst the growing and revolving extremity turned itself up more and more with the hop we have seen that three internodes were at the same time revolving and this was the case with most of the plants observed by me with all if in full health two internodes revolved so that by the time the lower one ceased to revolve the one above was in full action with a terminal internode just commencing to move with hoya carnosa on the other hand a depending shoot without any developed leaves inches in length and consisting of seven internodes a minute terminal one an inch in length being counted continually but slowly swayed from side to side in a semicircular course with the extreme internodes making complete revolutions this swaying movement was certainly due to the movement of the lower internodes which however had not force sufficient to swing the whole shoot round the central supporting stick the case of another asclepiadaceous plant viz ceropegia gardnerii is worth briefly giving i allowed the top to grow out almost horizontally to the length of inches this now consisted of three long internodes terminated by two short ones the whole revolved in a course opposed to the sun the reverse of that of the hop at rates between hrs m and hrs m for each revolution the extreme tip thus made a circle of above feet or inches in diameter and feet in circumference travelling at the rate of or inches per hour the weather being hot the plant was allowed to stand on my study table and it was an interesting spectacle to watch the long shoot sweeping this grand circle night and day in search of some object round which to twine if we take hold of a growing sapling we can of course bend it to all sides in succession so as to make the tip describe a circle like that performed by the summit of a spontaneously revolving plant by this movement the sapling is not in the least twisted round its own axis i mention this because if a black point be painted on the bark on the side which is uppermost when the sapling is bent towards the holder s body as the circle is described the black point gradually turns round and sinks to the lower side and comes up again when the circle is completed and this gives the false appearance of twisting which in the case of spontaneously revolving plants deceived me for a time the appearance is the more deceitful because the ax,2

under him who was forward to tell what he could or would do if he could only get sight of the enemy he had but little confidence in him he was never able to find more than a score or so of recruits whom he would accept and only about a dozen among them his sons in whom he had perfect faith when he was here some years ago he showed to a few a little manuscript book his orderly book i think he called it containing the names of his company in kansas and the rules by which they bound themselves and he stated that several of them had already sealed the contract with their blood when some one remarked that with the addition of a chaplain it would have been a perfect cromwellian troop he observed that he would have been glad to add a chaplain to the list if he could have found one who could fill that office worthily it is easy enough to find one for the united states army i believe that he had prayers in his camp morning and evening nevertheless he was a man of spartan habits and at sixty was scrupulous about his diet at your table excusing himself by saying that he must eat sparingly and fare hard as became a soldier or one who was fitting himself for difficult enterprises a life of exposure a man of rare common sense and directness of speech as of action a transcendentalist above all a man of ideas and principles that was what distinguished him not yielding to a whim or transient impulse but carrying out the purpose of a life i noticed that he did not overstate anything but spoke within bounds i remember particularly how in his speech here he referred to what his family had suffered in kansas without ever giving the least vent to his pent up fire it was a volcano with an ordinary chimney flue also referring to the deeds of certain border ruffians he said rapidly paring away his speech like an experienced soldier keeping a reserve of force and meaning they had a perfect right to be hung he was not in the least a rhetorician was not talking to buncombe or his constituents anywhere had no need to invent anything but to tell the simple truth and communicate his own resolution therefore he appeared incomparably strong and eloquence in congress and elsewhere seemed to me at a discount it was like the speeches of cromwell compared with those of an ordinary king as for his tact and prudence i will merely say that at a time when scarcely a man from the free states was able to reach kansas by any direct route at least without having his arms taken from him he carrying what imperfect guns and other weapons he could collect openly and slowly drove an ox cart through missouri apparently in the capacity of a surveyor with his surveying compass exposed in it and so passed unsuspected and had ample opportunity to learn the designs of the enemy for some time after his arrival he still followed the same profession when for instance he saw a knot of the ruffians on the prairie discussing of course the single topic which then occupied their minds he would perhaps take his compass and one of his sons and proceed to run an imaginary line right through the very spot on which that conclave had assembled and when he came up to them he would naturally pause and have some talk with them learning their news and at last all their plans perfectly and having thus completed his real survey he would resume his imaginary one and run on his line till he was out of sight when i expressed surprise that he could live in kansas at all with a price set upon his head and so large a number including the authorities exasperated against him he accounted for it by saying it is perfectly well understood that i will not be taken much of the time for some years he has had to skulk in swamps suffering from poverty and from sickness which was the consequence of exposure befriended only by indians and a few whites but though it might be known that he was lurking in a particular swamp his foes commonly did not care to go in after him he could even come out into a town where there were more border ruffians than free state men and transact some business without delaying long and yet not be molested for said he no little handful of men were willing to undertake it and a large body could not be got together in season as for his recent failure we do not know the facts about it it was evidently far from being a wild and desperate attempt his enemy mr vallandigham is compelled to say that it was among the best planned executed conspiracies that ever failed not to mention his other successes was it a failure or did it show a want of good management to deliver from bondage a dozen human beings and walk off with them by broad daylight for weeks if not months at a leisurely pace through one state after another for half the length of the north conspicuous to all parties with a price set upon his head going into a court room on his way and telling what he had done thus convincing missouri that it was not profitable to try to hold slaves in his neighborhood and this not because the government menials were lenient but because they were afraid of him yet he did not attribute his success foolishly to his star or to any magic he said truly that the reason why such greatly superior numbers quailed before him was as one of his prisoners confessed because they lacked a cause a kind of armor which he and his party never lacked when the time came few men were found willing to lay down their lives in defence of what they knew to be wrong they did not like that this should be their last act in this world but to make haste to his last act and its effects the newspapers seem to ignore or perhaps are really ignorant of the fact that there are at least as many as two or three indivi,2

into doors and windows then after a moment s pause she added if we should mark the place on the floor all the year round we should find what time the sun is farthest to the south so we should said rollo it would be in the winter said lucy yes said rollo in the middle of the winter exactly yes said lucy and in the middle of the summer it would be nearest overhead jonas and i will try it said rollo i can try it in the house said lucy where the sun shines in at my chamber window o no said rollo that won t do why not said lucy because the window does not come down to the floor and so does not let the sun in enough o that makes no difference said lucy we have nothing to do with the bottom of the door you only mark where it shines in the farthest and that place is made by the top of the door for it shines in farthest by the top of the door well said rollo i don t know but that the house will do but then you can t chalk on the carpet chalk on the carpet said lucy yes to mark the place no said lucy thinking but i can mark it some other way how asked rollo why i can put a pin in said lucy o dear said rollo with a laugh put a pin in that s no way to mark a shadow it isn t a shadow said lucy yes it is said rollo no said lucy a shadow is dark and this is bright yes said rollo this is a bright shadow some shadows are bright and some are dark o rollo said lucy and she turned away from him a little out of humor the truth was that rollo and lucy were getting decidedly into a dispute from the sublime heights of practical astronomy they had fallen by a sad and very rapid descent to a childish altercation rollo had a very high idea of the superior facilities afforded by jonas s barn floor for observing the daily changes in the sun s meridian altitude and he did not like the idea of lucy s finding that she had equally good opportunities for observation at her home lucy was a little fretted at rollo s captious spirit but then her mind soon became unruffled again and she turned back towards rollo and said as they walked along the yard i don t think the sunshine on the floor is a shadow rollo but then i don t see why a shadow would not do just as well how said rollo why look there at the shadow of that post that would do she pointed to a post with a rounded top upon it which stood by the side of the garden gate the shadow clear distinct and well defined was projected upon the walk and lucy told rollo that they might mark the place where the top of that shadow came every day and that that would do just as well but how could we mark it said rollo why we could drive a little stake unto the ground o that would not do said rollo people would trip over them and break them down they would be exactly in the walk lucy saw that this would be a difficulty and for a moment seemed to be at a loss at length she said we might go somewhere else then where the people would not come but what should we do for a post said rollo could not we get jonas to drive a tall stake down said lucy yes said rollo i suppose so the children went out into the garden to find a good smooth place and while they were walking about there rollo s mother came out and they told her the whole story she seemed quite interested in the plan and told them of a better way than any that they had thought of you see said she that the height of the stake or pole that makes the shadow is not material for the shadow of a small one will vary just as much in proportion to its length as that of a long one will so instead of taking a wooden stake out of doors you might take a large pin and drive it down a little way into the window sill in the house then you can mark the shadow with a pen very exactly so we can said lucy clapping her hands and you might put a piece of white paper or a card down first continued rollo s mother and drive the pin through that and then mark the places where the end of the shadow comes every day directly on the card with a fine pen thus you could be a great deal more exact than you can in chalking upon a barn floor rollo asked his mother if she would not be kind enough to help them fix their apparatus but she said she would give them particular directions though she should prefer letting them do the whole themselves and then if they met with any difficulties they might come and report them to her and she would tell them how to surmount them so she recommended to them to go and find a blank card or piece of white pasteboard or of stiff white paper as big as a common card then said she choose some window where the sun shines in at noon and put the card down upon the sill and drive the pin down through it but you must not drive the pin through the middle of the card for the shadow will always be off to the north of the pin and therefore the pin may be pretty near the south end of the card then the shadow will be more likely to come wholly upon the card even when it is longest you had better place the card in such a position too that its sides shall lie in the direction of north and south then the shadow at noon will lie along exactly in the middle of it you must get a large and stout pin too and drive it in firmly a little way with a small hammer it will be well too to drive another smaller pin into the other end of the card so as to keep it fixed in its north and south position how can we know when it is north and south exactly said lucy you cannot do it exactly said rollo s mother but you can get it pretty near one way is to borrow father s little compass and adjust it by that another way is to see when it is exactly twelv,2

what kind of errand it might be that occasioned her to be prepared for questioning her quick eye seemed to read my thoughts for as it met mine she added that there was no harm in what she had been doing but it was a great secret a secret which she did not even know herself this was said with no appearance of cunning or deceit but with an unsuspicious frankness that bore the impress of truth she walked on as before growing more familiar with me as we proceeded and talking cheerfully by the way but she said no more about her home beyond remarking that we were going quite a new road and asking if it were a short one while we were thus engaged i revolved in my mind a hundred different explanations of the riddle and rejected them every one i really felt ashamed to take advantage of the ingenuousness or grateful feeling of the child for the purpose of gratifying my curiosity i love these little people and it is not a slight thing when they who are so fresh from god love us as i had felt pleased at first by her confidence i determined to deserve it and to do credit to the nature which had prompted her to repose it in me there was no reason however why i should refrain from seeing the person who had inconsiderately sent her to so great a distance by night and alone and as it was not improbable that if she found herself near home she might take farewell of me and deprive me of the opportunity i avoided the most frequented ways and took the most intricate and thus it was not until we arrived in the street itself that she knew where we were clapping her hands with pleasure and running on before me for a short distance my little acquaintance stopped at a door and remaining on the step till i came up knocked at it when i joined her a part of this door was of glass unprotected by any shutter which i did not observe at first for all was very dark and silent within and i was anxious as indeed the child was also for an answer to our summons when she had knocked twice or thrice there was a noise as if some person were moving inside and at length a faint light appeared through the glass which as it approached very slowly the bearer having to make his way through a great many scattered articles enabled me to see both what kind of person it was who advanced and what kind of place it was through which he came it was an old man with long grey hair whose face and figure as he held the light above his head and looked before him as he approached i could plainly see though much altered by age i fancied i could recognize in his spare and slender form something of that delicate mould which i had noticed in the child their bright blue eyes were certainly alike but his face was so deeply furrowed and so very full of care that here all resemblance ceased the place through which he made his way at leisure was one of those receptacles for old and curious things which seem to crouch in odd corners of this town and to hide their musty treasures from the public eye in jealousy and distrust there were suits of mail standing like ghosts in armour here and there fantastic carvings brought from monkish cloisters rusty weapons of various kinds distorted figures in china and wood and iron and ivory tapestry and strange furniture that might have been designed in dreams the haggard aspect of the little old man was wonderfully suited to the place he might have groped among old churches and tombs and deserted houses and gathered all the spoils with his own hands there was nothing in the whole collection but was in keeping with himself nothing that looked older or more worn than he as he turned the key in the lock he surveyed me with some astonishment which was not diminished when he looked from me to my companion the door being opened the child addressed him as grandfather and told him the little story of our companionship why bless thee child said the old man patting her on the head how couldst thou miss thy way what if i had lost thee nell i would have found my way back to you grandfather said the child boldly never fear the old man kissed her then turning to me and begging me to walk in i did so the door was closed and locked preceding me with the light he led me through the place i had already seen from without into a small sitting room behind in which was another door opening into a kind of closet where i saw a little bed that a fairy might have slept in it looked so very small and was so prettily arranged the child took a candle and tripped into this little room leaving the old man and me together you must be tired sir said he as he placed a chair near the fire how can i thank you by taking more care of your grandchild another time my good friend i replied more care said the old man in a shrill voice more care of nelly why who ever loved a child as i love nell he said this with such evident surprise that i was perplexed what answer to make and the more so because coupled with something feeble and wandering in his manner there were in his face marks of deep and anxious thought which convinced me that he could not be as i had been at first inclined to suppose in a state of dotage or imbecility i don t think you consider i began i don t consider cried the old man interrupting me i don t consider her ah how little you know of the truth little nelly little nelly it would be impossible for any man i care not what his form of speech might be to express more affection than the dealer in curiosities did in these four words i waited for him to speak again but he rested his

house into dangerous and forbidden places at the risk of life and limb was our hero s chief delight in early childhood to fall out of his cradle and crib to tumble down stairs and to bruise his little body until it was black and blue were among his most ordinary experiences such mishaps never drew tears however from his large blue eyes after struggling violently to get over the rail of his crib and falling heavily on the floor he was wont to rise with a gasp and gaze in bewilderment straight before him as if he were rediscovering the law of gravitation no phrenologist ever conceived half the number of bumps that were developed on his luckless cranium we make no apology to the reader for entering thus minutely into the character and experiences of a baby that baby is the hero of our tale true it is as a young man that he is to play his part but a great philosopher has told us that he always felt constrained to look upon children with respect and a proverb states that the child is the father of the man without either pinning our faith to the philosopher or the proverb we think it both appropriate and interesting to note the budding genius of the wanderer whose footsteps we are about to follow baby will s mother was a gentle and loving but weak woman his father william horace osten by name was a large hearty affectionate but coarse man he appreciated his wife s gentle loving nature but could not understand her weakness she admired her husband s manly energetic spirit but could not understand his roughness he loved the baby and resolved to make a man of him she loved the baby and wished to make him a good boy in the furtherance of their designs the one tried to make him a lion the other sought to convert him into a lamb which of the two would have succeeded can never be known it is probable that both would have failed by counteracting each other as is no uncommon experience when fathers and mothers act separately in such a matter if the one had succeeded he would have made him a bear the other if successful would have made him a nincompoop fortunately for our hero a higher power saved him and by training him in the school of adversity made him both a lion and a lamb the training was very severe and prolonged however it was long before the lion would consent to lie down in the same breast with the lamb certainly it was not during the season of childhood the lion appeared to have it all his own way during that interesting epoch and the father was proportionately gratified while the mother was dismayed boyhood came and with it an increased desire to rove and a more fervent thirst for adventure at school our hero obtained the name that stuck to him through life wandering will the seaport town in the west of england in which he dwelt had been explored by him in all its ramifications there was not a retired court a dark lane or a blind alley with which he was unfamiliar every height crag cliff plantation and moor within ten miles of his father s mansion had been thoroughly explored by will before he was eight years of age and his aspiring spirit longed to take a wider flight i want to go to sea father said he one evening after tea looking in his father s face with much more of the leonine gaze than the father had bargained for his training up to that point had been almost too successful this was not the first time that the boy had stated the same wish his gaze therefore did not quail when his father looked up from his newspaper and said sternly fiddlesticks boy hold your tongue father repeated will in a tone that caused mr osten to

in the shape of improvement new york will probably never possess any churches of an architecture to attract attention for their magnitude and magnificence the policy of the country which separates religion from the state precludes this by confining all the expenditures of this nature to the several parishes few of which are rich enough to do more than erect edifices of moderate dimensions and cost the romish church so much addicted to addressing the senses manifests some desire to construct its cathedrals but they are necessarily confined to the limits and ornaments suited to the resources of a branch of the church that in this country is by no means affluent the manner in which the americans are subdivided into sects also conflicts with any commendable desire that may exist to build glorious temples in honor of the deity and convenience is more consulted than taste perhaps in all that relates to ecclesiastical architecture nevertheless a sensible improvement in this respect has occurred within the last few years to which we shall elsewhere advert it will be in their trade their resources their activity and their influence on the rest of the world as well as in their population that the towns of manhattan will be first entitled to rank with the larger capitals of europe so obvious rapid and natural has been the advance of all the places that it is not easy for the mind to regard anything belonging to them as extraordinary or out of rule there is not a port in the whole country that is less indebted to art and the fostering hand of government than this it is true certain forts most of them of very doubtful necessity have been constructed for defence but no attack having ever been contemplated or if contemplated attempted they have been dead letters in the history of its progress we are not aware that government has ever expended one cent in the waters of manhattan except for the surveys construction of the aforesaid military works and the erection of the lighthouses that form a part of the general provision for the safe navigation of the entire coast some money has been expended for the improvement of the shallow waters of the hudson but it has been as much or more for the advantage of the upper towns and the trade coastwise generally than for the special benefit of new york the immense natural advantages of the bays and islands at the mouth of the hudson have in a great degree superseded the necessity of such assistance nature has made every material provision for a mart of the first importance and perhaps it has been fortunate that the towns have been left like healthful and vigorous children managed by prudent parents to take the inclination and growth pointed out to them by this safest and best of guides london is indebted to artificial causes in a great degree for its growth and power that great law of trade which renders settling places indispensable has contributed to her prosperity and continued ascendency long after the day when rival ports are carrying away her fleets and commerce she is a proof of the difficulty of shaking a commercial superiority long established scarce a cargo that enters the ports of the kingdom that does not pay tribute to her bankers or merchants but london is a political capital and that in a country where the representation of the government is more imposing possessing greater influence than in any other christian nation the english aristocracy which wields the real authority of the state here makes its annual exhibition of luxury and wealth such as the world has never beheld anywhere else ancient rome possibly excepted and has had a large share in rendering london what it is new york has none of this adventitious aid both of the governments that of the united states and that of the state have long been taken from her leaving her nothing of this sort but her own local authorities but representation forms no part of the machinery of american policy it is supposed that man is too intellectual and philosophical to need it in this intellectual and philosophical country par excellence although such is the theory the whole struggle in private life is limited to the impression made by representation in the hands of individuals that which the government has improvidently cast aside society has seized upon and hundreds who have no claim to distinction beyond the possession of money profit by the mistake to place themselves in positions perhaps that they are not always exactly qualified to fill of all social usurpations that of mere

on ticonderoga in ruins and cast a dream like glance over pictures of the past and scenes of which this spot had been the theatre at first my fancy saw only the stern hills lonely lakes and venerable woods not a tree since their seeds were first scattered over the infant soil had felt the axe but had grown up and flourished through its long generation had fallen beneath the weight of years been buried in green moss and nourished the roots of others as gigantic hark a light paddle dips into the lake a birch canoe glides round the point and an indian chief has passed painted and feather crested armed with a bow of hickory a stone tomahawk and flint headed arrows but the ripple had hardly vanished from the water when a white flag caught the breeze over a castle in the wilderness with frowning ramparts and a hundred cannon there stood a french chevalier commandant of the fortress paying court to a copper colored lady the princess of the land and winning her wild love by the arts which had been successful with parisian dames a war party of french and indians were issuing from the gate to lay waste some village of new england near the fortress there was a group of dancers the merry soldiers footing it with the swart savage maids deeper in the wood some red men were growing frantic around a keg of the fire water and elsewhere a jesuit preached the faith of high cathedrals beneath a canopy of forest boughs and distributed crucifixes to be worn beside english scalps i tried to make a series of pictures from the old french war when fleets were on the lake and armies in the woods and especially of abercrombie s disastrous repulse where thousands of lives were utterly thrown away but being at a loss how to order the battle i chose an evening scene in the barracks after the fortress had surrendered to sir jeffrey amherst what an immense fire blazes on that hearth gleaming on swords bayonets and musket barrels and blending with the hue of the scarlet coats till the whole barrack room is quivering with ruddy light one soldier has thrown himself down to rest after a deer hunt or perhaps a long run through the woods with indians on his trail two stand up to wrestle and are on the point of coming to blows a fifer plays a shrill accompaniment to a drummer s song a strain of light love and bloody war with a chorus thundered forth by twenty voices meantime a veteran in the corner is prosing about dettingen and fontenoy and relates camp traditions of marlborough s battles till his pipe having been roguishly charged with gunpowder makes a terrible explosion under his nose and now they all vanish in a puff of smoke from the chimney i merely glanced at the ensuing twenty years which glided peacefully over the frontier fortress till ethan allen s shout was

the cannon of burgoyne pointing down upon their stronghold from the brow of mount defiance announced a new conqueror of ticonderoga no virgin fortress this forth rushed the motley throng from the

behold only the gray and weed grown ruins they were as peaceful in the sun as a warrior s grave hastening to the rampart i perceived that the signal had been given by the steamboat franklin which landed a passenger from whitehall at the tavern and resumed its progress northward to reach canada the next morning a sloop was pursuing the same track a little skiff had just crossed the ferry while

proprietor of the chateau which had so attracted his admiration and was equally surprised and pleased at hearing in reply a nobleman named whom we shall call lord woodville how fortunate much of browne s early recollections both at school and at college had been connected with young woodville whom by a few questions he now ascertained to be the same with the owner of this fair domain he had been raised to the peerage by the decease of his father a few months before and as the general learned from the landlord the term of mourning being ended was now taking possession of his paternal estate in the jovial season of merry autumn accompanied by a select party of friends to enjoy the sports of a country famous for game this was delightful news to our traveller frank woodville had been richard browne s fag at eton and his chosen intimate at christ church their pleasures and their tasks had been the same and the honest soldier s heart warmed to find his early friend in possession of so delightful a residence and of an estate as the landlord assured him with a nod and a wink fully adequate to maintain and add to his dignity nothing was more natural than that the traveller should suspend a journey which there was nothing to render hurried to pay a visit to an old friend under such agreeable circumstances the fresh horses therefore had only the brief task of conveying the general s travelling carriage to woodville castle a porter admitted them at a modern gothic lodge built in that style to correspond with the castle itself and at the same time rang a bell to give warning of the approach of visitors apparently the sound of the bell had suspended the separation of the company bent on the various amusements of the morning for on entering the court of the chateau several young men were lounging about in their sporting dresses looking at and criticizing the dogs which the keepers held in readiness to attend their pastime as general browne alighted the young lord came to the gate of the hall and for an instant gazed as at a stranger upon the countenance of his friend on which war with its fatigues and its wounds had made a great alteration but the uncertainty lasted no longer than till the visitor had spoken and the hearty greeting which followed was such as can only be exchanged betwixt those who have passed together the merry days of careless boyhood or early youth if i could have formed a wish my dear browne said lord woodville it would have been to have you here of all men upon this occasion which my friends are good enough to hold as a sort of holiday do not think you have been unwatched during the years you have been absent from us i have traced you through your dangers your triumphs your misfortunes and was delighted to see that whether in victory or defeat the name of my old friend was always distinguished with applause the general made a suitable reply and congratulated his friend on his new dignities and the possession of a place and domain so beautiful nay you have seen nothing of it as yet said lord woodville and i trust you do not mean to leave us till you are better acquainted with it it is true i confess that my present party is pretty large and the old house like other places of the kind does not possess so much accommodation as the extent of the outward walls appears to promise but we can give you a comfortable old fashioned room and i venture to suppose that your campaigns have taught you to be glad of worse quarters the general shrugged his shoulders and laughed i presume he said the worst apartment in your chateau is considerably superior to the old tobacco cask in which i was fain to take up my night s lodging when i was in the bush as the virginians call it with the light corps there i lay like diogenes himself so delighted with my covering from the elements that i made a vain attempt to have it rolled on to my next quarters but my commander for the time would give way to no such luxurious provision and i took farewell of my beloved cask with tears in my eyes well then since you do not fear your quarters said lord woodville you will stay with me a week at least of guns dogs fishing rods flies and means of sport by sea and land we have enough and to spare you cannot pitch on an amusement but we will find the means of pursuing it but if you prefer the gun and pointers i will go with you myself and see whether you have mended your shooting since you have been amongst the indians of the back settlements the general gladly accepted his friendly host s proposal in all its points after a morning of manly exercise the company met at dinner where it was the delight of lord woodville to conduce to the display of the high properties of his recovered friend so as to recommend him to his guests most of whom were persons of distinction he led general browne to speak of the scenes he had witnessed and as every word marked alike the brave officer and the sensible man who retained possession of his cool judgment under the most imminent dangers the company looked upon the soldier with general respect as on one who had proved himself possessed of an uncommon portion of personal courage that attribute of all others of which everybody desires to be thought possessed the day at woodville castle ended as usual in such mansions the hospitality stopped within the limits of good order music in which the young lord was a proficient succeeded to the circulation of the bottle cards and billiards for those who preferred such amusements were in readiness but the

how disgracefully the court martial ended as to our marriage would my people acknowledge it at home or would my people acknowledge ours said the bride of tinkling again the two warriors exchanged

too much of the frank freehearted soldier and had inherited too much of his father s temperament to make a scheming trapper or a thrifty bargainer there was something in the whole appearance of the captain that prepossessed me in his favor he was of the middle size well made and well set and a military frock of foreign cut that had seen service gave him a look of compactness his countenance was frank open and engaging well browned by the sun and had something of a french expression he had a pleasant black eye a high forehead and while he kept his hat on the look of a man in the jocund prime of his days but the moment his head was uncovered a bald crown gained him credit for a few more years than he was really entitled to being extremely curious at the time about every thing connected with the far west i addressed numerous questions to him they drew from him a number of extremely striking details which were given with mingled modesty and frankness and in a gentleness of manner and a soft tone of voice contrasting singularly with the wild and often startling nature of his themes it was difficult to conceive the mild quiet looking personage before you the actual hero of the stirring scenes related in the course of three or four months happening to be at the city of washington i again came upon the captain who was attending the slow adjustment of his affairs with the war department i found him quartered with a worthy brother in arms a major in the army here he was writing at a table covered with maps and papers in the centre of a large barrack room fancifully decorated with indian arms and trophies and war dresses and the skins of various wild animals and hung round with pictures of indian games and ceremonies and scenes of war and hunting in a word the captain was beguiling the tediousness of attendance at court by an attempt at authorship and was rewriting and extending his travelling notes and making maps of the regions he had explored as he sat at the table in this curious apartment with his high bald head of somewhat foreign cast he reminded me of some of those antique pictures of authors that i have seen in old spanish volumes the result of his labors was a mass of manuscript which he subsequently put at my disposal to fit it for publication and bring it before the world i found it full of interesting details of life among the mountains and of the singular castes and races both white men and red men among whom he had sojourned it bore too throughout the impress of his character his bonhommie his kindliness of spirit and his susceptibility to the grand and beautiful that manuscript has formed the staple of the following work i have occasionally interwoven facts and details gathered from various sources especially from the conversations and journals of some of the captain s contemporaries who were actors in the scenes he describes i have also given it a tone and coloring drawn from my own observation during an excursion into the indian country beyond the bounds of civilization as i before observed however the work is substantially the narrative of the worthy captain and many of its most graphic passages are but little varied from his own language i shall conclude this notice by a dedication which he had made of his manuscript to his hospitable brother in arms in whose quarters i found him occupied in his literary labors it is a dedication which i believe possesses the qualities not always found in complimentary documents of the kind of being sincere and being merited to james harvey hook major u s a

authorship of mr carlyle says mr james russell lowell alluding to these papers we find some not obscure hints of the future man the outward fashion of them is that of the period but they are distinguished by a certain security of judgment remarkable at any time remarkable especially in one so young carlyle in these first essays already shows the influence of his master goethe the most widely receptive of critics in a compact notice of montaigne there is not a word as to his religious scepticism the character is looked at purely from its human and literary sides here is a passage from the article on newfoundland interesting as containing perhaps the earliest germ of the later style the ships intended for the fishery on the southeast coast arrive early in june each takes her station opposite any unoccupied part of the beach where the fish may be most conveniently cured and retains it till the end of the season formerly the master who arrived first on any station was constituted fishing admiral and had by law the power of settling disputes among the other crews but the jurisdiction of those admirals is now happily superseded by the regular functionaries who reside on shore each captain directs his whole attention to the collection of his own cargo without minding the concerns of his neighbour having taken down what part of the rigging is removable they set about their laborious calling and must pursue it zealously their mode of proceeding is thus described by mr anspach a clerical person who lived in the island several years and has since written a meagre and very confused book which he calls a history of it to the new edinburgh review carlyle also contributed two papers one on joanna baillie s metrical legends and one on goethe s faust in the year he made a translation of legendre s geometry to which he prefixed an essay on proportion and the book appeared a year or two afterwards under the auspices of the late sir david brewster a the essay on proportion remains to this day the most lucid and succinct exposition of the subject hitherto published footnote a elements of geometry and trigonometry with notes translated from the french of a m legendre edited by david brewster ll d with notes and additions and an introductory chapter on proportion edinburgh published by oliver and boyd and g and w b whittaker london pp xvi sir david brewster s preface in which he speaks of an introduction on proportion by the translator is dated edinburgh august i was already says carlyle in his reminiscences getting my head a little up translating legendre s geometry for brewster i still remember a happy forenoon in which i did a fifth book or complete doctrine of proportion for that work complete really and lucid and yet one of the briefest ever known it was begun and done that forenoon and i have except correcting the press next week never seen it since but still i feel as if it were right enough and felicitous in its kind i

honourable promise two touching records remain to us one in verse by thackeray and one in prose by carlyle for the next four years carlyle devoted his attention almost exclusively to german literature his life of schiller first appeared under the title of schiller s life and writings in the london magazine part i october part ii january part iii july august september it was enlarged and separately published by messrs taylor and hessey the proprietors of the magazine in the translation of wilhelm meister in a was the first real introduction of goethe to the reading world of great britain it appeared without the name of the translator but its merits were too palpable to be overlooked though some critics objected to the strong infusion of german phraseology which had been imported into the english version this acquired idiom never left our author even in his original works although the life of schiller written but a few months before is almost entirely free from the peculiarity wilhelm meister in its english dress was better received by the english reading public than by english critics de quincey in one of his dyspeptic fits fell upon the book its author and the translator b and

a sure sign of the revolving movement i will assume that it made at least one revolution during the first twenty four hours early the next morning its position was marked and it made a second revolution in hrs during the latter part of this revolution it moved much quicker and the third circle was performed in the evening in a little over hrs as on the succeeding morning i found that the shoot revolved in hrs m it must have made during the night four revolutions each at the average rate of a little over hrs i should add that the temperature of the room varied only a little the shoot had now grown inches in length and carried at its extremity a young internode inch in length which showed slight changes in its curvature the next or ninth revolution was effected in hrs m from this time forward the revolutions were easily observed the thirty sixth revolution was performed at the usual rate so was the last or thirty seventh but it was not completed for the internode suddenly became upright and after moving to the centre remained motionless i tied a weight to its upper end so as to bow it slightly and thus detect any movement but there was none some time before the last revolution was half performed the lower part of the internode ceased to move a few more remarks will complete all that need be said about this internode it moved during five days but the more rapid movements after the performance of the third revolution lasted during three days and twenty hours the regular revolutions from the ninth to thirty sixth inclusive were effected at the average rate of hrs m but the weather was cold and this affected the temperature of the room especially during the night and consequently retarded the rate of movement a little there was only one irregular movement which consisted in the stem rapidly making after an unusually slow revolution only the segment of a circle after the seventeenth revolution the internode had grown from to inches in length and carried an internode inch long which was just perceptibly moving and this carried a very minute ultimate internode after the twenty first revolution the penultimate internode was inches long and probably revolved in a period of about three hours at the twenty seventh revolution the lower and still moving internode was the penultimate and the ultimate inches in length and the inclination of the whole shoot was such that a circle inches in diameter was swept by it when the movement ceased the lower internode was inches and the penultimate inches in length so that from the twenty seventh to thirty seventh revolutions inclusive three internodes were at the same time revolving the lower internode when it ceased revolving became upright and rigid but as the whole shoot was left to grow unsupported it became after a time bent into a nearly horizontal position the uppermost and growing internodes still revolving at the extremity but of course no longer round the old central point of the supporting stick from the changed position of the centre of gravity of the extremity as it revolved a slight and slow swaying movement was given to the long horizontally projecting shoot and this movement i at first thought was a spontaneous one as the shoot grew it hung down more and more whilst the growing and revolving extremity turned itself up more and more with the hop we have seen that three internodes were at the same time revolving and this was the case with most of the plants observed by me with all if in full health two internodes revolved so that by the time the lower one ceased to revolve the one above was in full action with a terminal internode just commencing to move with hoya carnosa on the other hand a depending shoot without any developed leaves inches in length and consisting of seven internodes a minute terminal one an inch in length being counted continually but slowly swayed from side to side in a semicircular course with the extreme internodes making complete revolutions this swaying movement was certainly due to the movement of the lower internodes which however had not force sufficient to swing the whole shoot round the central supporting stick the case of another asclepiadaceous plant viz ceropegia gardnerii is worth briefly giving i allowed the top to grow out almost horizontally to the length of inches this now consisted of three long internodes terminated by two short ones the whole revolved in a course opposed to the sun the reverse of that of the hop at rates between hrs m and hrs m for each revolution the extreme tip thus made a circle of above feet or inches in diameter and feet in circumference travelling at the rate of or inches per hour the weather being hot the plant was allowed to stand on my study table and it was an interesting spectacle to watch the long shoot sweeping this grand circle night and day in search of some object round which to twine if we take hold of a growing sapling we can of course bend it to all sides in succession so as to make the tip describe a circle like that performed by the summit of a spontaneously revolving plant by this movement the sapling is not in the least twisted round its own axis i mention this because if a black point be painted on the bark on the side which is uppermost when the sapling is bent towards the holder s body as the circle is described the black point gradually turns round and sinks to the lower side and comes up again when the circle is completed and this gives the false appearance of twisting which in the case of spontaneously revolving plants deceived me for a time the appearance is the more deceitful because the ax,2

the english monarchy known through all the world as westminster abbey after a time when england became at length one kingdom the king built his palace and established his parliament and opened his court in westminster not far from the abbey the place being about three miles from the city was very convenient for this purpose in process of time public edifices were erected and noblemen s houses and new palaces for the king or for other members of the royal family were built and shops were set up for the sale of such things as the people of the court might wish to buy and streets and squares were laid out and in fine westminster became gradually quite an extended and famous town it was still however entirely distinct from london being about three miles from it farther up the river the principal road from london to westminster followed the margin of the water and was called the strand towards westminster the road diverged from the river so as to leave a space between wide enough for houses and along this space the great nobles from time to time built magnificent palaces around great square courts where they could ride in under an archway the fronts of these palaces were towards the road and there were gardens behind them leading down to the water at the foot of the garden there was usually a boat house and a landing where the people who lived in the palace or their friends could embark on board boats for excursions on the thames in the mean time while westminster was thus becoming a large and important town london itself three miles farther down the river was also constantly growing too in its own way as a town of merchants and artisans other villages too began to spring up in every direction around these great centres and london and westminster gradually spreading finally met each other and then extending on each side gradually swallowed up these villages until now the whole region for five or six miles in every direction from the original centres forms one mighty mass of streets squares lanes courts terraces all crowded with edifices and thronged with population in this mass all visible distinction between the several villages which have been swallowed up is entirely lost though the two original centres remain as widely separated and as distinct as ever the primeval london has however lost its exclusive right to its name and is now simply called the city and in the same manner westminster is called the west end and sometimes the town while the name london is used to denote the whole of the vast conglomeration which envelops and includes the two original capitals the city and the west end though thus swallowed as it were in the general metropolis are still entirely distinct they are in fact in some respects even more widely distinct from each other now than ever each is in its own way at the head of its class of cities the city is the greatest and wealthiest mart of commerce in the world while the west end is the seat and centre of the proudest and most extended political and military power in fact the commercial organization which centres in the city and the military one which has its head quarters around the throne at the west end are probably the greatest and most powerful organizations each of its kind that the world has ever known mr george explained all this to rollo as they walked together away from the london bridge station where the train in which they came in from the south stopped when it reached london but i will give a more detailed account of their conversation in the next chapter chapter ii london bridge when the train stopped at what is called the london bridge station the passengers all stepped out of their respective cars upon the platform in the english cars the doors are at the sides and not as in america at the ends so that the passengers get out nearly all at once and the platform becomes immediately crowded beyond the platform on the other side there is usually when a train comes in a long row of cabs and carriages drawn up ready to take the passengers from the several cars so that the traveller has generally nothing to do but to step across the platform from the car that he came in to the cab that is waiting there to receive him nor is there as is usual in america any difficulty or delay in regard to the baggage for each man s trunks are placed on the car that he rides in directly over his head so that while he walks across the platform to the cab the railway porter takes his trunk across and places it on the top of the cab and thus he is off from the station in his cab within two minutes sometimes after he arrived at it in the car the railway porters who attend to the business of transferring the passengers thus from the railway carriages to those of the street are very numerous all along the platform and they are very civil and attentive to the passengers especially to those who come in the first class cars and more especially still according to my observation and experience if the traveller has an agreeable looking lady under his charge the porters are dressed in a sort of uniform by which they are readily distinguished from the crowd they are strictly forbidden to receive any fee or gratuity from the passengers this prohibition however does not prevent their taking very thankfully the shillings or sixpences a that are often offered them particularly by americans who being strangers in the country and not understanding the customs very well think that they require a little more attention than others and so are willing to pay a little extra fee it is however contrary to the rules of the station for the porters to receive any thing and if they take it at all they try to do it as secretly as possible i once knew a

there had now begun for friedrich a new rule of procedure which much altered his appearance in the world thrice over had he tried by the aggressive or invasive method thrice over made a plunge at the enemy s heart hoping so to disarm or lame him but that with resources spent to such a degree is what he cannot do a fourth time he is too weak henceforth to think of that prussia has always its king and his unrivalled talent but that is pretty much the only fixed item prussia versus france austria russia sweden and the german reich what is it as a field of supplies for war except its king these are failing year by year and at a rate fatally swift in comparison friedrich cannot now do leuthens rossbachs far shining feats of victory which astonish all the world his fine prussian veterans have mostly perished and have been replaced by new levies and recruits who are inferior both in discipline and native quality though they have still people say a noteworthy taste of the old prussian sort in them and do in fact fight well to the last but it is observable says retzow somewhere and indeed it follows from the nature of the case that while the prussian army presents always its best kind of soldiers at the beginning of a war austria such are its resources in population always improves in that particular and its best troops appear in the last campaigns in a word friedrich stands on the defensive henceforth disputing his ground inch by inch and is reduced more and more to battle obscurely with a hydra coil of enemies and impediments and to do heroisms which make no noise in the gazettes and alas which cannot figure in history either what is more a sorrow to me here friedrich say all judges of soldiership and human character who have studied friedrich sufficiently is greater than ever in these four years now coming berenhorst in kriegskunst retzow c and this i have found more and more to be a true thing verifiable and demonstrable in time and place though unluckily for us hardly in this time or this place at all a thing which cannot by any method be made manifest to the general reader who delights in shining summary feats and is impatient of tedious preliminaries and investigations especially of maps which are the indispensablest requisite of all a thing in short that belongs peculiarly to soldier students who can undergo the dull preliminaries most dull but most

reader under such conditions as there are friedrich s winter in breslau was of secluded silent sombre character this time nothing of stir in it but from work only in marked contrast with the last and its kindly visitors and gayeties a friedrich given up to his manifold businesses to his silent sorrows i have passed my winter like a carthusian monk he writes to d argens i dine alone i spend my life in reading and writing and i do not sup when one is sad it becomes at last too burdensome to hide one s grief continually and it is better to give way to it by oneself than to carry one s gloom into society nothing solaces me but the vigorous application required in steady and continuous labor this distraction does force one to put away painful ideas while it lasts but alas no sooner is the work done than these fatal companions present themselves again as if livelier than ever maupertuis was right the sum of evil does certainly surpass that of good but to me it is all one i have almost

translate itself into a pineapple nor a betony to moralize itself into a lily nor a snapdragon to soften himself into a lilac it is very possible indeed that the recent phrenzy for the investigation

every possible spur spike jag sting rent blotch flaw freckle filth or venom which can be detected in the construction or distilled from the dissolution of vegetable organism but with these obscene processes and prurient apparitions the gentle and happy scholar of flowers has nothing whatever to do i am amazed and saddened more than i can care to say by finding how much that is abominable may be discovered by an ill taught curiosity in the purest things that earth is allowed to produce for us perhaps if we were less reprobate in our own ways the grass which is our type might conduct itself better even though it has no hope but of being cast into the oven in the meantime healthy human eyes and thoughts are to be set on the lovely laws of its growth and habitation and not on the mean mysteries of its birth i relieve therefore our presently inquiring souls from any farther care as to the reason for a violet s spur or for the extremely ugly arrangements of its stamens and style invisible unless by vexatious and vicious peeping you are to think of a violet only in its green leaves and purple or golden petals you are to know the varieties of form in both proper to common species and in what kind of places they all most fondly live and most deeply glow and the recreation of the minde which is taken heereby cannot be but verie good and honest for they admonish and stir up a man to that which is comely and honest for flowers through their beautie varietie of colour and exquisite forme do bring to a liberall and gentle manly minde the remembrance of honestie comeliness and all kinds of vertues for it would be an unseemely and filthie thing as a certain wise man saith for him that doth looke upon and handle faire and beautiful things and who frequenteth and is conversant in faire and beautiful places to have his mind not faire but filthie and deformed thus gerarde in the close of his introductory notice of the violet speaking of things honesty comeliness and the like scarcely now recognized as desirable in the realm of england but having previously observed that violets are useful for the making of garlands for the head and posies to smell to in which last function i observe they are still pleasing to the british public and i found the children here only the other day munching a confection of candied violet leaves what pleasure the flower can still give us uncandied and unbound but in its own place and life i will try to trace through some of its constant laws and first let us be clear that the native colour of the violet is violet and that the white and yellow kinds though pretty in their place and way are not to be thought of in generally meditating the flower s quality or power a white violet is to black ones what a black man is to white ones and the yellow varieties are i believe properly pansies and belong also to wild districts for the most part but the true violet which i have just now called black with gerarde the blacke or purple violet hath a great prerogative above others and all the nobler species of the pansy itself are of full purple inclining however in the ordinary wild violet to blue in the laws of f sole chap vii i have made this dark pansy the representative of purple pure the viola odorata of the link between that full purple and blue and the heath blossom of the link between that full purple and red the reader will do well as much as may be possible to him to associate his study of botany as indeed all other studies of visible things with that of painting but he must remember that he cannot know what violet colour really is unless he watch the flower in its early growth it becomes dim in age and dark when it is gathered at least when it is tied in bunches but i am under the impression that the colour actually deadens also at all events no other single flower of the same quiet colour lights up the ground near it as a violet will the bright hounds tongue looks merely like a spot of bright paint but a young violet glows like painted glass which when you have once well noticed the two lines of milton and shakspeare which seem opposed will both become clear to you the said lines are dragged from hand to hand along their pages of pilfered quotations by the hack botanists who probably never saw them nor anything else in shakspeare or milton in their lives till even in reading them where they rightly come you can scarcely recover their fresh meaning but none of the botanists ever think of asking why perdita calls the violet dim and milton glowing perdita indeed calls it dim at that moment in thinking of her own love and the hidden passion of it unspeakable nor is milton without some purpose of using it as an emblem of love mourning but in both cases the subdued and quiet hue of the flower as an actual tint of colour and the strange force and life of it as a part of light are felt to their uttermost and obs,1

of the neatest feet and ankles that ever stepped pretty thinks i so far so good the way she whacked the pillers shooked the blankets and pitched into the beds was a caution specially one blunderin old featherbed that wouldn t do nothin but sag round in a pig headed sort of way that would have made most girls get mad and give up kitty didn t but just wrastled with it like a good one till she got it turned banged and spread to suit her then she plumped down in the middle of it with a sarcy little nod and chuckle to herself that tickled me mightily plucky thinks i better n better jest then an old woman came flyin out the back door callin kitty kitty squire partridge s son s here long with a friend been gunnin want luncheon and i m all in the suds do come down and see to em where are they says

perfectly happy and jovial and affectionate and innocent as possible he makes them with large noses but he loves them and you always find something kind in the midst of his humor and the ugliness

the way on holidays in order to ponder for an hour before that delightful window in sweeting s alley in walks through fleet street to vanish abruptly down fairburn s passage and there make one at his

no heart even the old dandy of sixty must have laughed at his own wondrous grotesque image as they say louis philippe did who saw all the caricatures that were made of himself and there are some of cruikshank s designs which have the blessed faculty of creating laughter as often as you see them as diggory says in the play who is bidden by his master not to laugh while waiting at table don t tell

perpetual well of laughter buckets full of fun can be drawn from it we have formed no such friendships as that boyish one of the man with the mouth but though in our eyes mr cruikshank reached his apogee some eighteen years since it must not be imagined that such is really the case eighteen sets of children have since then learned to love and admire him and may many more of their successors be brought up in the same delightful faith it is not the artist who fails but the men who grow cold the men from whom the illusions why illusions realities of youth disappear one by one who have no

in their course through life the mild and gentle rule of dr melmoth like that of a father over his children was more destructive to vice than a sterner sway and though youth is never without its follies they have seldom been more harmless than they were here the students indeed ignorant of their own bliss sometimes wished to hasten the time of their entrance on the business of life but they found in after years that many of their happiest remembrances many of the scenes which they would with least reluctance live over again referred to the seat of their early studies the exceptions to this remark were chiefly those whose vices had drawn down even from that paternal government a weighty retribution dr melmoth at the time when he is to be introduced to the reader had borne the matrimonial yoke and in his case it was no light burden nearly twenty years the blessing of children however had been denied him a circumstance which he was accustomed to consider as one of the sorest trials that checkered his pathway for he was a man of a kind and affectionate heart that was continually seeking objects to rest itself upon he was inclined to believe also that a common offspring would have exerted a meliorating influence on the temper of mrs melmoth the character of whose domestic government often compelled him to call to mind such portions of the wisdom of antiquity as relate to the proper endurance of the shrewishness of woman but domestic comforts as well as comforts of every other kind have their drawbacks and so long as the balance is on the side of happiness a wise man will not murmur such was the opinion of dr melmoth and with a little aid from philosophy and more from religion he journeyed on contentedly through life when the storm was loud by the parlor hearth he had always a sure and quiet retreat in his study and there in his deep though not always useful labors he soon forgot whatever of disagreeable nature pertained to his situation this small and dark apartment was the only portion of the house to which since one firmly repelled invasion mrs melmoth s omnipotence did not extend here to reverse the words of queen elizabeth there was but one master and no mistress and that man has little right to complain who possesses so much as one corner in the world where he may be happy or miserable as best suits him in his study then the doctor was accustomed to spend most of the hours that were unoccupied by the duties of his station the flight of time was here as swift as the wind and noiseless as the snow flake and it was a sure proof of real happiness that night often came upon the student before he knew it was midday dr melmoth was wearing towards age having lived nearly sixty years when he was called upon to assume a character to which he had as yet been a stranger he had possessed in his youth a very dear friend with whom his education had associated him and who in his early manhood had been his chief intimate circumstances however had separated them for nearly thirty years half of which had been spent by his friend who was engaged in mercantile pursuits in a foreign country the doctor had nevertheless retained a warm interest

rendered it one of the most interesting and notable campaigns ever undertaken since the expedition of pizarro and cortes in the middle ages no such novel and hazardous expedition is on record the country itself was like that of the far famed prester john x x everything about it smacked of the marvellous it was more mountainous more inaccessible more war loving more wild than any other country in the world the king with whom we waged war was a potentate who by his military talents had raised himself from a comparatively obscure position to the sovereignty of all abyssinia he was enlightened beyond his race patronised strangers encouraged manufactures endeavoured in every way to improve the condition of his country and was yet a bloodthirsty tyrant the people themselves were a strange race far more civilised than other african nations christians in the midst of a mahometan and pagan continent a mixture of many races x x african greek arab and jew altogether it was a land of romance nor had travellers done much to enlighten us as to the country some had described it as fertile in the extreme others had spoken of it as a land of mountain and defile where no sustenance could be hoped for for the army they had united only in prophesying evil things x x hunger and thirst inaccessible mountain and pathless wastes fever cholera small pox dysentery the tetse fly tapeworm and guinea worm we were to be consumed with fire we were to be annihilated with stones rolled upon us when in ravines we were to be cut off in detail upon our marches we were to be harassed to death by repeated night and day attacks all these and many other prophecies were freely uttered and it really appeared as if our expedition was to partake strongly of the nature of a forlorn hope the friends of officers and men said good bye to them as if they were going to certain death and insurance offices doubled and trebled the premium upon their lives all this assisted to raise the public interest and anxiety to the highest point it is needless now to say that almost the whole of the adverse predictions were entirely falsified and that we have met with no difficulties whatever beyond mountain and ravine the want of transport and the scarcity of food generally as the subject is known it is yet necessary before commencing the history of the campaign to say a few words upon the events which preceded and caused it and as the subject has been exhausted by dr beke in his able work on the abyssinian captives i cannot do better than preface my story with a brief epitome of the facts recited in his volume dr beke was well acquainted with mr plowden our late consul there and knew thoroughly the whole of the events which led to the captivity of the english party and he was in intimate communication with their friends here his statements are supported by numerous official documents and this volume in which he now sets forth the state of the case may be apparently received with confidence as reliable in every particular the kingdom of abyssinia is of extreme antiquity and was once a great and flourishing empire it has been ruled by a succession of monarchs claiming direct descent from menilek the son of king solomon by the queen of sheba for the last century the legitimate monarch has had very little power the real authority being in the hands of the most powerful of the chiefs of the various tribes composing the empire and who as in turns they became dominant assumed the title of ras or vizier keeping the puppet emperor in a state of honourable captivity administering affairs and carrying on wars without the slightest reference to his wishes and opinions the kingdom of abyssinia consists of an immense elevated plateau or table land of great fertility and possessing a temperate and agreeable climate at its north eastern extremity it approaches very nearly to the sea the port of massowah at that point being its natural outlet towards the south the table land trends away from the sea being separated from it by a wide low lying plain inhabited by mahometan tribes the religion of the natives of abyssinia itself has been from very early times christian and they possess a native version of the scriptures which dates from the fourth century of the christian era the laws of this singular people are like our own founded upon the code of justinian the various tribes which form the empire although acknowledging the supremacy of the emperor are yet virtually independent paying a mere nominal tribute and making war upon and deposing him whenever they feel strong enough to do so these tribes are very numerous but the principal may be considered to be those inhabiting tigre which is the province nearest to massowah and therefore commanding the avenues of approach to the interior amhara the capital lying to the south of tigre lasta in the centre and shoa godjam and kwara to the west of these tigre is the representative of the ancient kingdom it is almost entirely surrounded by the river takkazye which separates it from the rest of the empire and its inhabitants speak the language of the ancient ethiopic in which is the early version of the bible since the middle of the sixteenth century the turks have claimed the entire seaboard but have only occupied the sawakin and massowah in the year the english government alarmed at the attempts of the french to obtain a footing in egypt dispatched mr salt afterwards consul general in egypt to abyssinia to open friendly relations with that power and that gentleman

in their course through life the mild and gentle rule of dr melmoth like that of a father over his children was more destructive to vice than a sterner sway and though youth is never without its follies they have seldom been more harmless than they were here the students indeed ignorant of their own bliss sometimes wished to hasten the time of their entrance on the business of life but they found in after years that many of their happiest remembrances many of the scenes which they would with least reluctance live over again referred to the seat of their early studies the exceptions to this remark were chiefly those whose vices had drawn down even from that paternal government a weighty retribution dr melmoth at the time when he is to be introduced to the reader had borne the matrimonial yoke and in his case it was no light burden nearly twenty years the blessing of children however had been denied him a circumstance which he was accustomed to consider as one of the sorest trials that checkered his pathway for he was a man of a kind and affectionate heart that was continually seeking objects to rest itself upon he was inclined to believe also that a common offspring would have exerted a meliorating influence on the temper of mrs melmoth the character of whose domestic government often compelled him to call to mind such portions of the wisdom of antiquity as relate to the proper endurance of the shrewishness of woman but domestic comforts as well as comforts of every other kind have their drawbacks and so long as the balance is on the side of happiness a wise man will not murmur such was the opinion of dr melmoth and with a little aid from philosophy and more from religion he journeyed on contentedly through life when the storm was loud by the parlor hearth he had always a sure and quiet retreat in his study and there in his deep though not always useful labors he soon forgot whatever of disagreeable nature pertained to his situation this small and dark apartment was the only portion of the house to which since one firmly repelled invasion mrs melmoth s omnipotence did not extend here to reverse the words of queen elizabeth there was but one master and no mistress and that man has little right to complain who possesses so much as one corner in the world where he may be happy or miserable as best suits him in his study then the doctor was accustomed to spend most of the hours that were unoccupied by the duties of his station the flight of time was here as swift as the wind and noiseless as the snow flake and it was a sure proof of real happiness that night often came upon the student before he knew it was midday dr melmoth was wearing towards age having lived nearly sixty years when he was called upon to assume a character to which he had as yet been a stranger he had possessed in his youth a very dear friend with whom his education had associated him and who in his early manhood had been his chief intimate circumstances however had separated them for nearly thirty years half of which had been spent by his friend who was engaged in mercantile pursuits in a foreign country the doctor had nevertheless retained a warm interest in the welfare of his old associate though the different nature of their thoughts and occupations had prevented them from corresponding after a silence of so long continuance therefore he was

of ploughing to do down the lane he ploughed up the ground by the fences in this lane making one furrow every time he went up and down to his other work then in the spring he ploughed it again and by this time the turf had rotted and so the land had become mellow then jonas went away with the wagon one afternoon about two miles to a place where the raspberries were very abundant and dug up a large number of them and set them out along this lane on both sides of it and so in a year or two there was a great abundance of raspberries very near the house rollo stopped to eat some raspberries as he walked along he thought they would do exceedingly well with his bread to give a little variety to his luncheon after he had eaten as many as he wanted he thought he would gather his dipper full for jonas as he was busy at work and could not have time to gather any for himself he got his dipper full very quick for the raspberries were thick and large he thought it was an excellent plan for jonas to plant the raspberry bushes there but then he thought it was a great deal of trouble to bring them all from so great a distance i wonder said he to himself as he sat upon a log thinking of the subject why it would not have been just as well to plant raspberries themselves instead of setting out the bushes the raspberries must be the seeds i mean to take some of these big ones and try i dare say they ll grow but then he reflected that the spring was planting time and he knew very well that raspberries would not keep till spring and so he determined to ask jonas about it he accordingly rose up from the log and walked along carrying his dipper very carefully in his hand at length he reached the brook there was a rude bridge over it made of two logs placed side by side and short boards nailed across them for a foot way it was only wide enough for persons to walk across the cattle and teams always went across through the water at a shallow place just below the bridge rollo lay down upon the bridge and looked into the water there were some skippers and some whirlabouts upon the water the skippers were long legged insects shaped somewhat like a cricket and they stood tiptoe upon the surface of the water rollo wondered how they could keep up their feet did not sink into the water at all and every now and then they would give a sort of leap and away they would shoot over the surface as if it had been ice rollo reached his hand down and tried to catch one to examine his feet but he could not succeed they were too nimble for him he thought that if he could only catch one and have an opportunity to examine his feet he could see how it was that he could stand so upon the water rollo was considering whether it was possible or not that jonas might make something like the skippers feet for him to put upon his feet so that he might walk on the water when suddenly he heard a bubbling sound in the brook near the shore he looked there and saw some bubbles of air coming up out of the bottom and rising to the top of the water he thought this was very singular it was not strange that the air should come up through the water to the top for air is much lighter than water the wonder was how the air could ever get down there from wondering at this extraordinary phenomenon rollo began to wonder at another quite different question that is where all the water in the brook could come from he looked at a little cascade just above the bridge where the water rushed through a narrow place between two rocks and watched it a few minutes wondering that it should continue running so all the time forever and surprised also that he had never wondered at it before he looked into the clear transparent current which poured steadily down between the rocks and said to himself strange there it runs and runs all the time all day and all night all summer and all winter all this year and all last year and every year where can all the water come from then he thought that he should like to follow the brook up and find where it came from but he concluded that it must be a great way to go through bushes and rocks and marshes and he saw at once that the expedition was out of the question for him just then he heard another gurgling in the water near him and looking down he saw more bubbles coming up to the surface very near where they had come up before rollo thought he would get a stick and see if he could not poke up the mud and find out what there was down there to make such a bubbling he thought that perhaps it might be some sort of animal blowing he went off of the bridge therefore and began to look about for a stick he had just found one when all at once he heard a noise in the bushes he looked up suddenly not knowing what was coming but in a moment saw jonas walking along towards him ah jonas said rollo are you going home yes said jonas unless you will go for me well said rollo what do you want me to get i want some fire to burn up some brush you can bring out the lantern very well said rollo i will go only i wish you would tell me where these bubbles come from out of the bottom of the brook what bubbles said jonas so rollo took his stick and pushed the end of it down into the mud and that made more bubbles come up they are bubbles of air said jonas but how comes the air down there said rollo under the water i don t know said jonas and besides i must not stay and talk here i must go back to my work i will talk to you about it when you come back so jonas returned to his work and rollo went to the house again after the lantern when he came back to the brook he found that he could not make any more bubbles come up but,2

pressed their goods seized for some debts of his and she with two small children turned into the streets a begging it is a circumstance not to be forgotten that she was very young under nineteen and most remarkably handsome she went to a linen draper s shop took some coarse linen off the counter and slipped it under her cloak the shopman saw her and she laid it down for this she was hanged her defence was i have the trial in my pocket that she had lived in credit and wanted for nothing till a press gang came and stole her husband from her but since then she had no bed to lie on nothing to give her children to eat and they were almost naked and perhaps she might have done something wrong for she hardly knew what she did the parish officers testified the truth of this story but it seems there had been a good deal of shop lifting about ludgate an example was thought necessary and this woman was hanged for the comfort and satisfaction of shopkeepers in ludgate street when brought to receive sentence she behaved in such a frantic manner as proved her mind to be in a distracted and desponding state and the child was sucking at her breast when she set out for tyburn chapter in the year there stood upon the borders of epping forest at a distance of about twelve miles from london measuring from the standard in cornhill or rather from the spot on or near to which the standard used to be in days of yore a house of public entertainment called the maypole which fact was demonstrated to all such travellers as could neither read nor write and at that time a vast number both of travellers and stay at homes were in this condition by the emblem reared on the roadside over against the house which if not of those goodly proportions that maypoles were wont to present in olden times was a fair young ash thirty feet in height and straight as any arrow that ever english yeoman drew the maypole by which term from henceforth is meant the house and not its sign the maypole was an old building with more gable ends than a lazy man would care to count on a sunny day huge zig zag chimneys out of which it seemed as though even smoke could not choose but come in more than naturally fantastic shapes imparted to it in its tortuous progress and vast stables gloomy ruinous and empty the place was said to have been built in the days of king henry the eighth and there was a legend not only that queen elizabeth had slept there one night while upon a hunting excursion to wit in a certain oak panelled room with a deep bay window but that next morning while standing on a mounting block before the door with one foot in the stirrup the virgin monarch had then and there boxed and cuffed an unlucky page for some neglect of duty the matter of fact and doubtful folks of whom there were a few among the maypole customers as unluckily there always are in every little community were inclined to look upon this tradition as rather apocryphal but whenever the landlord of that ancient hostelry appealed to the mounting block itself as evidence and triumphantly pointed out that there it stood in the same place to that very day the doubters never failed to be put down by a large majority and all true believers exulted as in a victory whether these and many other stories of the like nature were true or untrue the maypole was really an old house a very old house perhaps as old as it claimed to be and perhaps older which will sometimes happen with houses of an uncertain as with ladies of a certain age its windows were old diamond pane lattices its floors were sunken and uneven its ceilings blackened by the hand of time and heavy with massive beams over the doorway was an ancient porch quaintly and grotesquely carved and here on summer evenings the more favoured customers smoked and drank ay and sang many a good song too sometimes reposing on two grim looking high backed settles which like the twin dragons of some fairy tale guarded the entrance to the mansion in the chimneys of the disused rooms swallows had built their nests for many a long year and from earliest spring to latest autumn whole colonies of sparrows chirped and twittered in the eaves there were more pigeons about the dreary stable yard and out buildings than anybody but the landlord could reckon up the wheeling and circling flights of runts fantails tumblers and pouters were perhaps not quite consistent with the grave and sober character of the building but the monotonous cooing which never ceased to be raised by some among them all day long suited it exactly and seemed to lull it to rest with its overhanging stories drowsy little panes of glass and front bulging out and projecting over the pathway the old house looked as if it were nodding in its sleep indeed it needed no very great stretch of fancy to detect in it other resemblances to humanity the bricks of which it was built had originally been a deep dark red but had grown yellow and discoloured like an old man s skin the sturdy timbers had decayed like teeth and here and there the ivy like a warm garment to comfort it in its age wrapt its green leaves closely round the time worn walls it was a hale and hearty age though still and in the summer or autumn evenings when the glow of the setting sun fell upon the oak and chestnut trees of the adjacent forest the old house partaking of its lustre seemed their fit companion and to have many good years of life in him yet the evening with which we have to do was neither a summer nor an autumn one but the twilight of a day in march when the

and tangible good has resulted from his constant interference in my affairs so that in my distrustful moods i am apt to suspect monsieur du miroir s sympathy to be mere outward show not a whit better nor worse than other people s sympathy nevertheless as mortal man must have something in the guise of sympathy and whether the true metal or merely copper washed is of less moment i choose rather to content myself with monsieur du miroir s such as it is than to seek the sterling coin and perhaps miss even the counterfeit in my age of vanities i have often seen him in the ballroom and might again were i to seek him there we have encountered each other at the tremont theatre where however he took his seat neither in the dress circle pit nor upper regions nor threw a single glance at the stage though the brightest star even fanny kemble herself might be culminating there no this whimsical friend of mine chose to linger in the saloon near one of the large looking glasses which throw back their pictures of the illuminated room he is so full of these unaccountable eccentricities that i never like to notice monsieur du miroir nor to acknowledge the slightest connection with him in places of public resort he however has no scruple about claiming my acquaintance even when his common sense if he had any might teach him that i would as willingly exchange a nod with the old nick it was but the other day that he got into a large brass kettle at the entrance of a hardware store and thrust his head the moment afterwards into a bright new warming pan whence he gave me a most merciless look of recognition he smiled and so did i but these childish tricks make decent people rather shy of monsieur du miroir and subject him to more dead cuts than any other gentleman in town one of this singular person s most remarkable peculiarities is his fondness for water wherein he excels any temperance man whatever his pleasure it must be owned is not so much to drink it in which respect a very moderate quantity will answer his occasions as to souse himself over head and ears wherever he may meet with it perhaps he is a merman or born of a mermaid s marriage with a mortal and thus amphibious by hereditary right like the children which the old river deities or nymphs of fountains gave to earthly love when no cleaner bathing place happened to be at hand i have seen the foolish fellow in a horse pond some times he refreshes himself in the trough of a town pump without caring what the people think about him often while carefully picking my way along the street after a heavy shower i have been scandalized to see monsieur du miroir in full dress paddling from one mud puddle to another and plunging into the filthy depths of each seldom have i peeped into a well without discerning this ridiculous gentleman at the bottom whence he gazes up as through a long telescopic tube and probably makes discoveries among the stars by daylight wandering along lonesome paths or in pathless forests when i have come to virgin fountains of which it would have been pleasant to deem myself the first discoverer i have started to find monsieur du miroir there before me the solitude seemed lonelier for his presence i have leaned from a precipice that frowns over lake george which the french call nature s font of sacramental water and used it in their log churches here and their cathedrals beyond the sea and seen him far below in that pure element at niagara too where i would gladly have forgotten both myself and him i could not help observing my companion in the smooth water on the very verge of the cataract just above the table rock were i to reach the sources of the nile i should expect to meet him there unless he be another ladurlad whose garments the depth of ocean could not moisten it is difficult to conceive how he keeps himself in any decent pickle though i am bound to confess that his clothes seem always as dry and comfortable as my own but as a friend i could wish that he would not so often expose himself in liquor all that i have hitherto related may be classed among those little personal oddities which agreeably diversify the surface of society and though they may sometimes annoy us yet keep our daily intercourse fresher and livelier than if they were done away by an occasional hint however i have endeavored to pave the way for stranger things to come which had they been disclosed at once monsieur du miroir might have been deemed a shadow and myself a person of no veracity and this truthful history a fabulous legend but now that the reader knows me worthy of his confidence i will begin to make him stare to speak frankly then i could bring the most astounding proofs that monsieur du miroir is at least a conjurer if not one of that unearthly tribe with whom conjurers deal he has inscrutable methods of conveying himself from place to place with the rapidity of the swiftest steamboat or rail car brick walls and oaken doors and iron bolts are no impediment to his passage here in my chamber for instance as the evening deepens into night i sit alone the key turned and withdrawn from the lock the keyhole stuffed with paper to keep out a peevish little blast of wind yet lonely as i seem were i to lift one of the lamps and step five paces eastward monsieur du miroir would be sure to meet me with a lamp also in his hand and were i to take the stage

into doors and windows then after a moment s pause she added if we should mark the place on the floor all the year round we should find what time the sun is farthest to the south so we should said rollo it would be in the winter said lucy yes said rollo in the middle of the winter exactly yes said lucy and in the middle of the summer it would be nearest overhead jonas and i will try it said rollo i can try it in the house said lucy where the sun shines in at my chamber window o no said rollo that won t do why not said lucy because the window does not come down to the floor and so does not let the sun in enough o that makes no difference said lucy we have nothing to do with the bottom of the door you only mark where it shines in the farthest and that place is made by the top of the door for it shines in farthest by the top of the door well said rollo i don t know but that the house will do but then you can t chalk on the carpet chalk on the carpet said lucy yes to mark the place no said lucy thinking but i can mark it some other way how asked rollo why i can put a pin in said lucy o dear said rollo with a laugh put a pin in that s no way to mark a shadow it isn t a shadow said lucy yes it is said rollo no said lucy a shadow is dark and this is bright yes said rollo this is a bright shadow some shadows are bright and some are dark o rollo said lucy and she turned away from him a little out of humor the truth was that rollo and lucy were getting decidedly into a dispute from the sublime heights of practical astronomy they had fallen by a sad and very rapid descent to a childish altercation rollo had a very high idea of the superior facilities afforded by jonas s barn floor for observing the daily changes in the sun s meridian altitude and he did not like the idea of lucy s finding that she had equally good opportunities for observation at her home lucy was a little fretted at rollo s captious spirit but then her mind soon became unruffled again and she turned back towards rollo and said as they walked along the yard i don t think the sunshine on the floor is a shadow rollo but then i don t see why a shadow would not do just as well how said rollo why look there at the shadow of that post that would do she pointed to a post with a rounded top upon it which stood by the side of the garden gate the shadow clear distinct and well defined was projected upon the walk and lucy told rollo that they might mark the place where the top of that shadow came every day and that that would do just as well but how could we mark it said rollo why we could drive a little stake unto the ground o that would not do said rollo people would trip over them and break them down they would be exactly in the walk lucy saw that this would be a difficulty and for a moment seemed to be at a loss at length she said we might go somewhere else then where the people would not come but what should we do for a post said rollo could not we get jonas to drive a tall stake down said lucy yes said rollo i suppose so the children went out into the garden to find a good smooth place and while they were walking about there rollo s mother came out and they told her the whole story she seemed quite interested in the plan and told them of a better way than any that they had thought of you see said she that the height of the stake or pole that makes the shadow is not material for the shadow of a small one will vary just as much in proportion to its length as that of a long one will so instead of taking a wooden stake out of doors you might take a large pin and drive it down a little way into the window sill in the house then you can mark the shadow with a pen very exactly so we can said lucy clapping her hands and you might put a piece of white paper or a card down first continued rollo s mother and drive the pin through that and then mark the places where the end of the shadow comes every day directly on the card with a fine pen thus you could be a great deal more exact than you can in chalking upon a barn floor rollo asked his mother if she would not be kind enough to help them fix their apparatus but she said she would give them particular directions though she should prefer letting them do the whole themselves and then if they met with any difficulties they might come and report them to her and she would tell them how to surmount them so she recommended to them to go and find a blank card or piece of white pasteboard or of stiff white paper as big as a common card then said she choose some window where the sun shines in at noon and put the card down upon the sill and drive the pin down through it but you must not drive the pin through the middle of the card for the shadow will always be off to the north of the pin and therefore the pin may be pretty near the south end of the card then the shadow will be more likely to come wholly upon the card even when it is longest you had better place the card in such a position too that its sides shall lie in the direction of north and south then the shadow at noon will lie along exactly in the middle of it you must get a large and stout pin too and drive it in firmly a little way with a small hammer it will be well too to drive another smaller pin into the other end of the card so as to keep it fixed in its north and south position how can we know when it is north and south exactly said lucy you cannot do it exactly said rollo s mother but you can get it pretty near one way is to borrow father s little compass and adjust it by that another way is to see when it is exactly twelv,2

fields of fancy as are significant ii the three notebooks are alike in format iii one of lord abinger s notebooks contains the first part of the fields of fancy chapter through the beginning of chapter pages the concluding portion occupies the first fifty four pages of the bodleian notebook there is then a blank page followed by three and a half pages scored out of what seems to be a variant of the end of chapter and the beginning of chapter a revised and expanded version of the first part of mathilda s narrative follows chapter and the beginning of chapter with a break between the account of her girlhood in scotland and the brief description of her father after his return finally there are four pages of a new opening which was used in mathilda this is an extremely rough draft punctuation is largely confined to the dash and there are many corrections and alterations the shelley rolls fragments twenty five sheets or slips of paper usually represent additions to or revisions of the fields of fancy many of them are numbered and some are keyed into the manuscript in lord abinger s notebook most of the changes were incorporated in mathilda the second abinger notebook contains the complete and final draft of mathilda pages it is for the most part a fair copy the text is punctuated and there are relatively few corrections most of them apparently the result of a final rereading made to avoid the repetition of words a few additions are written in the margins on several pages slips of paper containing evident revisions quite possibly originally among the shelley rolls fragments have been pasted over the corresponding lines of the text an occasional passage is scored out and some words and phrases are crossed out to make way for a revision following page four sheets containing the conclusion of the story are cut out of the notebook they appear the pages numbered to among the shelley rolls fragments a revised version pages to follows the cut iv the mode of telling the story in the final draft differs radically from that in the rough draft in the fields of fancy mathilda s history is set in a fanciful framework the author is transported by the fairy fantasia to the elysian fields where she listens to the discourse of diotima and meets mathilda mathilda tells her story which closes with her death in the final draft this unrealistic and largely irrelevant framework is discarded mathilda whose death is approaching writes out for her friend woodville the full details of her tragic history which she had never had the courage to tell him in person the title of the rough draft the fields of fancy and the setting and framework undoubtedly stem from mary wollstonecraft s unfinished tale the cave of fancy in which one of the souls confined in the center of the earth to purify themselves from the dross of their earthly existence tells to sagesta who may be compared with diotima the story of her ill fated love for a man whom she hopes to rejoin after her purgation is completed v mary was completely familiar with her mother s works this title was of course abandoned when the framework was abandoned and the name of the heroine was substituted though it is worth noticing that mary chose a name with the same initial letter as her own it was probably taken from dante there are several references in the story to the cantos of the purgatorio in which mathilda appears mathilda s father is never named nor is mathilda s surname given the name of the poet went through several changes welford lovel herbert and finally woodville the evidence for dating mathilda in the late summer and autumn of comes partly from the manuscript partly from mary s journal on the pages succeeding the portions of the fields of fancy in the bodleian notebook are some of shelley s drafts of verse and prose including parts of prometheus unbound and of epipsychidion both in italian and of the preface to the latter in english some prose fragments and extended portions of the defence of poetry written from the other end of the book are the ode to naples and the witch of atlas since these all belong to the years and it is probable that mary finished her rough draft some time in and that when she had copied her story shelley took over the notebook chapter of mathilda in lord abinger s notebook is headed florence nov th since the whole of mathilda s story takes place in england and scotland the date must be that of the manuscript mary was in florence at that time these dates are supported by entries in mary s journal which indicate that she began writing mathilda early in august while the shelleys were living in the villa valosano near leghorn on august after a gap of two months from the time of her little son s death she resumed her diary almost every day thereafter for a month she recorded write and by september she was saying copy on september she wrote finish copying my tale the next entry to indicate literary activity is the one word write on november on the th percy florence was born and mary did no more writing until march when she was working on valperga it is probable therefore that mary wrote and copied mathilda between august and september that she did some revision on november and finally dated the manuscript november the subsequent history of the manuscript is recorded in letters and journals when the gisbornes went to england on may they took mathilda with them they read it on the journey and recorded their admiration of it in their journal vi they were to show it to godwin and

following morning strained at their cables as if anxious to commence their struggle with the waves it is a custom of the directors of the hudson bay company to give a public dinner annually to the officers of their ships upon the eve of their departure from gravesend accordingly one of the gentlemen of the committee before leaving the vessel invited the captain and officers to attend and to my astonishment and delight also begged me to honour them with my company i accepted the invitation with extreme politeness and from inability to express my joy in any other way winked to my friend wiseacre with whom i had become by this time pretty familiar he being also invited winked in return to me and having disposed of this piece of juvenile freemasonry to our satisfaction we assisted the crew in giving three hearty cheers as the little steamer darted from the side and proceeded to the shore the dinner like all other public dinners was as good and substantial as a lavish expenditure of cash could make it but really my recollections of it are very indistinct the ceaseless din of plates glasses knives forks and tongues was tremendous and this together with the novelty of the scene the heat of the room and excellence of the viands tended to render me oblivious of much that took place almost all the faces present were strange to me who were and who were not the gentlemen of the committee was to me matter of the most perfect indifference and as no one took the trouble to address me in particular i confined myself to the interesting occupation of trying to make sense of a conversation held by upwards of fifty pairs of lungs at one and the same time nothing intelligible however was to be heard except when a sudden lull in the noise gave a bald headed old gentleman near the head of the table an opportunity of drinking the health of a red faced old gentleman near the foot upon whom he bestowed an amount of flattery perfectly bewildering and after making the unfortunate red faced gentleman writhe for half an hour in a fever of modesty sat down amid thunders of applause whether the applause by the way was intended for the speaker or the speakee i do not know but being quite indifferent i clapped my hands with the rest the red faced gentleman now purple with excitement then rose and during a solemn silence delivered himself of a speech to the effect that the day then passing was certainly the happiest in his mortal career that he could not find words adequately to express the varied feelings which swelled his throbbing bosom and that he felt quite faint with the mighty load of honour just thrown upon his delighted shoulders by his bald headed friend the red faced gentleman then sat down to the national air of rat tat tat played in full chorus with knives forks spoons nut crackers and knuckles on the polished surface of the mahogany table we left the dinner table at a late hour and after i in company with some other youngsters had done as much mischief as we conveniently could without risking our detention by the strong arm of the law we went down to the beach and embarked in a boat with the captain for the ship how the sailors ever found her in the impenetrable darkness which prevailed all around is a mystery to me to this day find her however they did and in half an hour i was in the land of nod the sun was blazing high in the heavens next morning when i awoke and gazed around for a few moments to discover where i was but the rattling of ropes and blocks the stamping of feet overhead the shouts of gruff voices and above all a certain strange and disagreeable motion in my dormitory soon enlightened me on that point we were going rapidly down the thames with a fair breeze and had actually set sail for the distant shores of hudson bay what took place during the next five or six days i know not the demon of sea sickness had completely prostrated my faculties bodily and mental some faint recollections i have of stormy weather horrible noises and hurried dinners but the greater part of that period is a miserable blank in my memory towards the sixth day however the savoury flavour of a splendid salmon trout floated past my dried up nostrils like afric s spicy gale and caused my collapsed stomach to yearn with strong emotion the ship too was going more quietly through the water and a broad stream of sunshine shot through the small window of my berth penetrated my breast and went down into the centre of my heart filling it with a calm complacent pleasure quite indescribable sounds however of an attack upon the trout roused me and with a mighty effort i tumbled out of bed donned my clothes and seated myself for the first time at the cabin table our party consisted of the captain mr carles a chief factor in the company s service the doctor young mr wiseacre afore mentioned the first and second mates and myself the captain was a thin middle sized offhand man thoroughly acquainted with his

at which scarcely any charm is lost it was so with elizabeth still the same handsome miss elliot that she had begun to be thirteen years ago and sir walter might be excused therefore in forgetting her age or at least be deemed only half a fool for thinking himself and elizabeth as blooming as ever amidst the wreck of the good looks of everybody else for he could plainly see how old all the rest of his family and acquaintance were growing anne haggard mary coarse every face in the neighbourhood worsting and the rapid increase of the crow s foot about lady russell s temples had long been a distress to him elizabeth did not quite equal her father in personal contentment thirteen years had seen her mistress of kellynch hall presiding and directing with a self possession and decision which could never have given the idea of her being younger than she was for thirteen years had she been doing the honours and laying down the domestic law at home and leading the way to the chaise and four and walking immediately after lady russell out of all the drawing rooms and dining rooms in the country thirteen winters revolving frosts had seen her opening every ball of credit which a scanty neighbourhood afforded and thirteen springs shewn their blossoms as she travelled up to london with her father for a few weeks annual enjoyment of the great world she had the remembrance of all this she had the consciousness of being nine and twenty to give her some regrets and some apprehensions she was fully satisfied of being still quite as handsome as ever but she felt her approach to the years of danger and would have rejoiced to be certain of being properly solicited by baronet blood within the next twelvemonth or two then might she again take up the book of books with as much enjoyment as in her early youth but now she liked it not always to be presented with the date of her own birth and see no marriage follow but that of a youngest sister made the book an evil and more than once when her father had left it open on the table near her had she closed it with averted eyes and pushed it away she had had a disappointment moreover which that book and especially the history of her own family must ever present the remembrance of the heir presumptive the very william walter elliot esq whose rights had been so generously supported by her father had disappointed her she had while a very young girl as soon as she had known him to be in the event of her having no brother the future baronet meant to marry him and her father had always meant that she should he had not been known to them as a boy but soon after lady elliot s death sir walter had sought the acquaintance and though his overtures had not been met with any warmth he had persevered in seeking it making allowance for the modest drawing back of youth and in one of their spring excursions to london when elizabeth was in her first bloom mr elliot had been forced into the introduction he was at that time a very young man just engaged in the study of the law and elizabeth found him extremely agreeable and every plan in his favour was confirmed he was invited to kellynch hall he was talked of and expected all the rest of the year but he never came the following spring he was seen again in town found equally agreeable again encouraged invited and expected and again he did not come and the next tidings were that he was married instead of pushing his fortune in the line marked out for the heir of the house of elliot he had purchased independence by uniting himself to a rich woman of inferior birth sir walter has resented it as the head of the house he felt that he ought to have been consulted especially after taking the young man so publicly by the hand for they must have been seen together he observed once at tattersall s and twice in the lobby of the house of commons his disapprobation was expressed but apparently very little regarded mr elliot had attempted no apology and shewn himself as unsolicitous of being longer noticed by the family as sir walter considered him unworthy of it all acquaintance between them had ceased this very awkward history of mr elliot was still after an interval of several years felt with anger by elizabeth who had liked the man for himself and still more for being her father s heir and whose strong family pride could see only in him a proper match for sir walter elliot s eldest daughter there was not a baronet from a to z whom her feelings could have so willingly acknowledged as an equal yet so miserably had he conducted himself that though she was at this present time the summer of wearing black ribbons for his wife she could not admit him to be worth thinking of again the disgrace of his first marriage might perhaps as there was no reason to suppose it perpetuated by offspring have been got over had he not done worse but he had as by the accustomary intervention of kind friends they had been informed spoken most

other some species see carpenter and if to these we add the numbers of animal and vegetable species which have become extinct we may safely estimate the number of species that have existed and are

or is it most likely that by continual modifications due to change of circumstances ten millions of varieties have been produced as varieties are being produced still doubtless many will reply that they can more easily conceive ten millions of special creations to have taken place than they can conceive that ten millions of varieties have arisen by successive modifications all such however will

it struggles up out of the ground do its limbs and viscera rush together from all the points of the compass or must we receive the old hebrew idea that god takes clay and moulds a new creature if they say that a new creature is produced in none of these modes which are too absurd to be believed then they are required to describe the mode in which a new creature may be produced a mode which does not seem absurd and such a mode they will find that they neither have conceived nor can conceive should the believers in special creations consider it unfair thus to call upon them to describe how special creations take place i reply that this is far less than they demand from the supporters of the development hypothesis they are merely asked to point out a conceivable mode on the other hand they ask not simply for a conceivable mode but for the actual mode they do not say show us how this may take place but they say show us how this does take place so far from its being unreasonable to put the above question it would be reasonable to ask not only for a possible mode of special creation but for an ascertained mode seeing that this is no greater a demand than they make upon their opponents and here we may perceive how much more defensible the new doctrine is than the old one even could the supporters of the development hypothesis merely show that the origination of species by the process of modification is conceivable they would be in a better position than their opponents but they can do much more than this they can show that the process of modification has effected and is effecting decided changes in all organisms subject to modifying influences though from the impossibility of getting at a sufficiency of facts they are unable to trace the many phases through which any existing species has passed in arriving at its present form or to identify the influences which caused the successive modifications yet they can show that any existing species animal or vegetable when placed under conditions different from its previous ones immediately begins to undergo certain changes fitting it for the new conditions they can show that in successive generations these changes continue until ultimately the new conditions become the natural ones they can show that in cultivated plants in domesticated animals and in the several races of men such alterations have taken place they can show that the degrees of difference so produced are often as in dogs greater than those on which distinctions of species are in other cases founded they can show that it is a matter of dispute whether some of these modified forms are varieties or separate species they can show too that the changes daily taking place in ourselves the facility that attends long practice and the loss of aptitude that begins when practice ceases the strengthening of passions habitually gratified and the weakening of those habitually curbed the development of every faculty bodily moral or intellectual according to the use made of it are all explicable on this same principle and thus they can show that throughout all organic nature there is at work a modifying influence of the kind they assign as the cause of these specific differences an influence which though slow in its action does in time if the circumstances demand it produce marked chang,2

early next spring we mean to go to rome and return here either for good which is very possible or for the purpose of arranging our house affairs and packing up books and furniture as it is we have our apartment for another year and shall let it if we can it has been painted cleaned and improved in all ways till my head and robert s ring again with the confusion of it all oh that we were gone since we are to go when out of sight of florence we shall begin to enjoy i hope the sight of other things but as it is the impression is only painful and dizzying our friends mr and mrs ogilvy go with us as far as venice and then leave us on a direct course for england having committed their children and nurses to the care of her sister at the baths of lucca meantime we take with us only wilson do write to me at venice poste restante that i may know you are thinking of me and excusing me kindly if you knew how uncertain and tormented we have been i won t even ask robert to add a line to this he is so overwhelmed with a flood of businesses but he bids me speak to you of him as affectionately and faithfully because affectionately as i have reason to do so kind it was in you to think of taking the trouble of finding us an apartment so really sensible we are to all your warm hearted goodness with fullness of heart on our side too and after all we are not parting either we shall find you in italy

out a system of romish doctrine from the most romish version of the s s the differences between the protestant version and the papistical are not certainly justifiable by the greek original on the side of the latter in fact the papistical version does not pretend to follow the greek text but a latin translation of the same it s a translation from a translation granting it however to be faithful i must repeat that to make out the romish system from even such a romish version could not be achieved so little does scripture however represented seem to me to justify that system of ecclesiastical doctrine and discipline i answer your question because you bid me but i am not a bit frightened at the idea of your becoming a r c however you may try to frighten me you have too much intelligence and

of ploughing to do down the lane he ploughed up the ground by the fences in this lane making one furrow every time he went up and down to his other work then in the spring he ploughed it again and by this time the turf had rotted and so the land had become mellow then jonas went away with the wagon one afternoon about two miles to a place where the raspberries were very abundant and dug up a large number of them and set them out along this lane on both sides of it and so in a year or two there was a great abundance of raspberries very near the house rollo stopped to eat some raspberries as he walked along he thought they would do exceedingly well with his bread to give a little variety to his luncheon after he had eaten as many as he wanted he thought he would gather his dipper full for jonas as he was busy at work and could not have time to gather any for himself he got his dipper full very quick for the raspberries were thick and large he thought it was an excellent plan for jonas to plant the raspberry bushes there but then he thought it was a great deal of trouble to bring them all from so great a distance i wonder said he to himself as he sat upon a log thinking of the subject why it would not have been just as well to plant raspberries themselves instead of setting out the bushes the raspberries must be the seeds i mean to take some of these big ones and try i dare say they ll grow but then he reflected that the spring was planting time and he knew very well that raspberries would not keep till spring and so he determined to ask jonas about it he accordingly rose up from the log and walked along carrying his dipper very carefully in his hand at length he reached the brook there was a rude bridge over it made of two logs placed side by side and short boards nailed across them for a foot way it was only wide enough for persons to walk across the cattle and teams always went across through the water at a shallow place just below the bridge rollo lay down upon the bridge and looked into the water there were some skippers and some whirlabouts upon the water the skippers were long legged insects shaped somewhat like a cricket and they stood tiptoe upon the surface of the water rollo wondered how they could keep up their feet did not sink into the water at all and every now and then they would give a sort of leap and away they would shoot over the surface as if it had been ice rollo reached his hand down and tried to catch one to examine his feet but he could not succeed they were too nimble for him he thought that if he could only catch one and have an opportunity to examine his feet he could see how it was that he could stand so upon the water rollo was considering whether it was possible or not that jonas might make something like the skippers feet for him to put upon his feet so that he might walk on the water when suddenly he heard a bubbling sound in the brook near the shore he looked there and saw some bubbles of air coming up out of the bottom and rising to the top of the water he thought this was very singular it was not strange that the air should come up through the water to the top for air is much lighter than water the wonder was how the air could ever get down there from wondering at this extraordinary phenomenon rollo began to wonder at another quite different question that is where all the water in the brook could come from he looked at a little cascade just above the bridge where the water rushed through a narrow place between two rocks and watched it a few minutes wondering that it should continue running so all the time forever and surprised also that he had never wondered at it before he looked into the clear transparent current which poured steadily down between the rocks and said to himself strange there it runs and runs all the time all day and all night all summer and all winter all this year and all last year and every year where can all the water come from then he thought that he should like to follow the brook up and find where it came from but he concluded that it must be a great way to go through bushes and rocks and marshes and he saw at once that the expedition was out of the question for him just then he heard another gurgling in the water near him and looking down he saw more bubbles coming up to the surface very near where they had come up before rollo thought he would get a stick and see if he could not poke up the mud and find out what there was down there to make such a bubbling he thought that perhaps it might be some sort of animal blowing he went off of the bridge therefore and began to look about for a stick he had just found one when all at once he heard a noise in the bushes he looked up suddenly not knowing what was coming but in a moment saw jonas walking along towards him ah jonas said rollo are you going home yes said jonas unless you will go for me well said rollo what do you want me to get i want some fire to burn up some brush you can bring out the lantern very well said rollo i will go only i wish you would tell me where these bubbles come from out of the bottom of the brook what bubbles said jonas so rollo took his stick and pushed the end of it down into the mud and that made more bubbles come up they are bubbles of air said jonas but how comes the air down there said rollo under the water i don t know said jonas and besides i must not stay and talk here i must go back to my work i will talk to you about it when you come back so jonas returned to his work and rollo went to the house again after the lantern when he came back to the brook he found that he could not make any more bubbles come up but,2

were nearly ended and when according to the ordinary routine he might have become a preacher a change of views induced him to abandon the intended profession this appears to have been about the year or when he was twenty four years of age for some time he seems to have been uncertain as to his future course along with irving he employed himself for a year or two as a teacher in fifeshire but gradually it became clear to him that his true vocation was that of literature accordingly parting from irving about the year the younger scot of annandale deliberately embraced the alternative open to him and became a general man of letters probably few have ever embraced that profession with qualifications so wide or with aims so high and severe apart altogether from his diligence in learning and from the extraordinary amount of acquired knowledge of all kinds which was the fruit of it there had been remarked in him from the first a strong originality of character a noble earnestness and fervor in all that he said or did and a vein of inherent constitutional contempt for the mean and the frivolous inclining him in some degree to a life of isolation and solitude add to this that his acquaintance with german literature in particular had familiarized him with ideas modes of thinking and types of literary character not then generally known in this country and yet in his opinion more deserving of being known than much of a corresponding kind that was occupying and ruling british thought the first period of mr carlyle s literary life may be said to extend from to or from his twenty sixth to his thirty second year it was during this period that he produced besides a translation of legendre s geometry to which he prefixed an essay on proportion his numerous well known translations from german writers and also his life of schiller the latter and a considerable proportion of the former were written by him during the leisure afforded him by an engagement he had formed in as tutor to charles buller whose subsequent brilliant though brief career in the politics of britain gives interest to this connection the first part of the life of schiller appeared originally in the london magazine of which john scott was editor and hazlitt charles lamb allan cunningham de quincey and hood were the best known supporters and the second and third parts were published in the same magazine in in this year appeared also the translation of g the s wilhelm meister which was published by messrs oliver and boyd of edinburgh without the translator s name this translation the first real introduction of g the to the reading world of great britain attracted much notice the translator said a critic in blackwood is we understand a young gentleman in this city who now for the first time appears before the public we congratulate him on his very promising debut and would fain hope to receive a series of really good translations from his hand he has evidently a perfect knowledge of german he already writes english better than is at all common even at this time and we know of no exercise more likely to produce effects of permanent advantage upon a young mind of intellectual ambition the advice here given to mr carlyle by his critic was followed by him in so far that in he published in edinburgh his specimens of german romance in four volumes one of these containing wilhelm meister s wanderjahre as a fresh specimen of g the the others containing tales from jean paul tieck mus us and hoffman meanwhile in mr carlyle had revised and enlarged his life of schiller and given it to the world in a separate form through the press of messrs taylor and hessay the proprietors of the london magazine in the same year quitting his tutorship of charles buller he had married a lady fitted in a pre eminent degree to be the wife of such a man it is interesting to know that mrs carlyle originally miss welch is a lineal descendent of the scottish reformer knox for some time after the marriage mr carlyle continued to reside in edinburgh but before he removed to craigenputtoch a small property in the most solitary part of dumfries shire the second period of mr carlyle s literary life extending from to or from his thirty second to his thirty ninth year was the period of the first decided manifestations of his extraordinary originality as a thinker probably the very seclusion in which he lived helped to develope in stronger proportions his native and peculiar tendencies the following account of his place and mode of life at this time was sent by him in to g the with whom he was then in correspondence and was published by the great german in the preface to a german translation of the life of schiller executed under his immediate care dumfries is a pleasant

people always ought to keep up their connexion with their relations whether they like them or not there were some very stupid people relations of mr staunton s near dykelands whom fanny and jane could not endure but she used to ask them to dinner very often and always made a point well if i had any disagreeable relations said elizabeth i would make a point of cutting them i do not see why relations have a right to be disagreeable i do not see how you could said helen for instance would you prevent mamma from ever seeing the major her own brother he cannot be half so well worth seeing since he chose to marry such a horrid wife said elizabeth would you never see horace again if he did such a thing said katherine i am sure i would not give him up would you i could trust horace i think said

confusions falsehoods and absurdities covering the whole field of life a thing that fills us with astonishment almost if it were possible with incredulity for truly it is not easy to understand that sane men could ever calmly with their eyes open believe and live by such a set of doctrines that men should have worshipped their poor fellow man as a god and not him only but stocks and stones and all manner of animate and inanimate objects and fashioned for themselves such a distracted chaos of hallucinations by way of theory of the universe all this looks like an incredible fable nevertheless it is a clear fact that they did it such hideous inextricable jungle of misworships misbeliefs men made as we are did actually hold by and live at home in this is strange yes we may pause in sorrow and silence over the depths of darkness that are in man if we rejoice in the heights of purer vision he has attained to such things were and are in man in all men in us too some speculators have a short way of accounting for the pagan religion mere quackery priestcraft and dupery say they no sane man ever did believe it merely contrived to persuade other men not worthy of the name of sane to believe it it will be often our duty to protest against this sort of hypothesis about men s doings and history and i here on the very threshold protest against it in reference to paganism and to all other isms by which man has ever for a length of time striven to walk in this world they have all had a truth in them or men would not have taken them up quackery and dupery do abound in religions above all in the more advanced decaying stages of religions they have fearfully abounded but quackery was never the originating influence in such things it was not the health and life of such things but their disease the sure precursor of their being about to die let us never forget this it seems to me a most mournful hypothesis that of quackery giving birth to any faith even in savage men quackery gives birth to nothing gives death to all things we shall not see into the true heart of anything if we look merely at the quackeries of it if we do not reject the quackeries altogether as mere diseases corruptions with which our and all men s sole duty is to have done with them to sweep them out of our thoughts as out of our practice man everywhere is the born enemy of lies i find grand lamaism itself to have a kind of truth in it read the candid clear sighted rather sceptical mr turner s account of his embassy to that country and see they have their belief these poor thibet people that providence sends down always an incarnation of himself into every generation at bottom some belief in a kind of pope at bottom still better belief that there is a greatest man that he is discoverable that once discovered we ought to treat him with an obedience which knows no bounds this is the truth of grand lamaism the discoverability is the only error here the thibet priests have methods of their own of discovering what man is greatest fit to be supreme over them bad methods but are they so much worse than our methods of understanding him to be always the eldest born of a certain genealogy alas it is a difficult thing to find good methods for we shall begin to have a chance of understanding paganism when we first admit that to its followers it was at one time earnestly true let us consider it very certain that men did believe in paganism men with open eyes sound senses men made altogether like ourselves that we had we been there should have believed in it ask now what paganism could have been another theory somewhat more respectable attributes such things to allegory it was a play of poetic minds say these theorists a shadowing forth in allegorical fable in personification and visual form of what such poetic minds had known and felt of this universe which agrees add they with a primary law of human nature still everywhere observably at work though in less important things that what a man feels intensely he struggles to speak out of him to see represented before him in visual shape and as if with a kind of life and historical reality in it now doubtless there is such a law and it is one of the deepest in human nature neither need we doubt that it did operate fundamentally in this business the hypothesis which ascribes paganism wholly or mostly to this agency i call a little more respectable but i cannot yet call it the true hypothesis think would we believe and take with us as our life guidance an allegory a poetic sport not sport but earnest is what we should require it is a most earnest thing to be alive in this world to die is not sport for a man man s life never was a sport to him it was a stern reality altogether a serious matter to be alive i find therefore that though these allegory theorists are on the way towards truth in this matter they have not reached it either pagan religion is indeed an allegory a symbol of what men felt and knew about the universe and all religions are symbols of that altering always as that alters but it seems to me a radical perversion and even inversion of the business to put that forward as the origin and moving cause when it was rather the result and termination to get beautiful allegories a perfect poetic symbol was not the want of men but to know what they were to believe

taking barbara tenderly by the ear for his youngest daughter was the doctor s pet the doctor certainly did not snub his son for he allowed him to go over to london when he was twenty two years of age in order that he might read with an english barrister it was the doctor s wish that his son might be called to the irish bar and the young man s desire that he might go to the english bar the doctor so far gave way under the influence of phineas himself and of all the young women of the family as to pay the usual fee to a very competent and learned gentleman in the middle temple and to allow his son one hundred and fifty pounds per annum for three years dr finn however was still firm in his intention that his son should settle in dublin and take the munster circuit believing that phineas

vacation no rumours of expected successes of expected professional successes reached the ears of any of the finn family at killaloe but nevertheless there came tidings which maintained those high ideas in the maternal bosom of which mention has been made and which were of sufficient strength to induce the doctor in opposition to his own judgment to consent to the continued residence of his son in london phineas belonged to an excellent club the reform club and went into very good society he was hand in glove with the hon laurence fitzgibbon the youngest son of lord claddagh he was intimate with barrington erle who had been private secretary one of the private secretaries to the great whig prime minister who was lately in but was now out he had dined three or four times with that great whig nobleman the earl of brentford and he had been assured that if he stuck to the english bar he would certainly do well though he might fail to succeed in court or in chambers he would doubtless have given to him some one of those numerous appointments for which none but clever young barristers are supposed to be fitting candidates the old doctor yielded for another year although at the end of the second year he was called upon to pay a sum of three hundred pounds which was then due by phineas to creditors in london when the doctor s male friends in and about killaloe heard that he had

giving up the midwifery he buckled to again to the great disgust of dr duggin who at this time said very ill natured things about young phineas at the end of the three years phineas was called to the bar and immediately received a letter from his father asking minutely as to his professional intentions his father recommended him to settle in dublin and promised the one hundred and fifty pounds for three more years on condition that this advice was followed he did not absolutely say that the allowance would be stopped if the advice were not followed but that was plainly to be implied that letter came at the moment of a dissolution of parliament lord de terrier the conservative prime minister who had now been in office for the almost unprecedentedly long period of fifteen months had found that he could not face continued majorities against him in the house of commons and had dissolved the house rumour declared that he would have much preferred to resign and betake himself once again to the easy glories of opposition but his party had naturally been obdurate with him and he had resolved to appeal to the country when phineas received his father s letter it had just been suggested to him at the reform club that he should stand for the irish borough of loughshane this proposition had taken phineas finn so much by surprise that when first made to him by barrington erle it took his breath away what he stand for parliament twenty four years old with no vestige of property belonging to him without a penny in his purse as completely dependent on his father as he was when he first went to school at eleven years of age and for loughshane a little borough in the county galway for which a brother of that fine old irish peer the earl of tulla had been sitting for the last twenty years a fine high minded representative of the thorough going orange protestant feeling of ireland and the earl of tulla to whom almost all loughshane belonged or at any rate the land about loughshane was one of his father s staunchest friends loughshane is in county galway but the earl of tulla usually lived at his seat in county clare not more than ten miles from killaloe and always confided his gouty feet and the weak nerves of the old countess and the stomachs of all his domestics to the care of dr finn how was it possible that phineas should stand,2

audible and startling whispers and the sighs of creatures so obviously not of earth that he could endure it no longer and with a great effort to break some malign spell that bound his faculties to silence and inaction he shouted with the full strength of his lungs his voice broken it seemed into an infinite multitude of unfamiliar sounds went babbling and stammering away into the distant

poet only as he was a penitent in his dream taking from his clothing a small red leather pocketbook one half of which was leaved for memoranda he discovered that he was without a pencil he broke a twig from a bush dipped it into a pool of blood and wrote rapidly he had hardly touched the paper with the point of his twig when a low wild peal of laughter broke out at a measureless distance away and growing ever louder seemed approaching ever nearer a soulless heartless and unjoyous laugh like that of the loon solitary by the lakeside at midnight a laugh which culminated in an unearthly shout close at hand then died away by slow gradations as if the accursed being that uttered it had withdrawn over the verge of the world whence it had come but the man felt that this was not so that it was near by and had not moved a strange sensation began slowly to take possession of his body and his mind he could not have said which if any of his senses was affected he felt it rather as a consciousness a mysterious mental assurance of some overpowering presence some supernatural malevolence different in kind from the invisible existences that swarmed about him and superior to them in power he knew that it had uttered that hideous laugh and now it seemed to be approaching him from what direction he did not know dared not conjecture all his former fears were forgotten or merged in the gigantic terror that now held him in thrall apart from that he had but one thought to complete his written appeal to the benign powers who traversing the haunted wood might some time rescue him if he should be denied the blessing of annihilation he wrote with terrible rapidity the twig in his fingers rilling blood without renewal but in the middle of a sentence his hands denied their service to his will his arms fell to his sides the book to the earth and powerless to move or cry out he found himself staring into the sharply drawn face and blank dead eyes of his own mother standing white and silent in the garments of the grave ii in his youth halpin frayser had lived with his parents in nashville tennessee the fraysers were well to do having a good position in such society as had survived the wreck wrought by civil war their children had the social and educational opportunities of their time and place and had responded to good associations and instruction with agreeable manners and cultivated minds halpin being the youngest and not over robust was perhaps a trifle spoiled he had the double disadvantage of a mother s assiduity and a father s neglect frayser pere was what no southern man of means is not a politician his country or rather his section and state made demands upon his time and attention so exacting that to those of his family he was compelled to turn an ear partly deafened by the thunder of the political captains and the shouting his own included young halpin was of a dreamy indolent and rather romantic turn somewhat more addicted to literature than law the profession to which he was bred among those of his relations who professed the modern faith of heredity it was well understood that in him the character of the late myron bayne a maternal great grandfather had revisited the glimpses of the moon by which orb bayne had in his lifetime been sufficiently affected to be a poet of no small colonial distinction if not specially observed it was observable that while a frayser who was not the proud possessor of a sumptuous copy of the ancestral poetical works printed at the family expense and long ago withdrawn from an inhospitable market was a rare frayser indeed there was an illogical indisposition to honor the great deceased in the person of his spiritual successor halpin was pretty generally deprecated as an intellectual black sheep who was likely at any moment to disgrace the flock by bleating in meter the tennessee fraysers were a practical folk not practical in the popular sense of devotion to sordid pursuits but having a robust contempt for any qualities unfitting a man for the wholesome vocation of politics in justice to young halpin it should be said that while in him were pretty faithfully reproduced most of the mental and moral characteristics ascribed by history and family tradition to the famous colonial bard his succession to the gift and faculty divine was purely inferential not only had he never been known to court the muse but in truth he could not have written correctly a line of verse to save himself from the killer of the wise still there was no knowing when the dormant faculty might wake and

most entire abandonment to grief carefully dressed and with no hint at invalidism but the chair he bore himself as easily and calmly as if the doom of lifelong helplessness did not hang over him a

plainly we couldn t afford it so everything was stopped and changed we gave up rome and you and are now actually on the point of setting out for venice venice is to console us for rome we go to morrow indeed the plan is to stay a fortnight at venice or more or less as the charm works and then to strike across to milan across the spl gen into switzerland and to linger there among the hills and lakes for a part of the summer so working out an intention of economy then down the rhine then by railroad to brussels so to paris settling there after which we pay our visit to england for a few weeks

amusements of the charms of ladies society he had known but little very many of the estates around him had been absolutely abandoned as was the case with his own coffee plantation and from others men had sent away their wives and daughters nay most of the proprietors had gone themselves leaving an overseer to extract what little might yet be extracted out of the property it too often happened that that little was not sufficient to meet the demands of the overseer himself the house at mount pleasant had been an irregular low roofed picturesque residence built with only one floor and surrounded on all sides by large verandahs in the old days it had always been kept in perfect order but now this was far from being the case few young bachelors can keep a house in order but no bachelor young or old can do so under such a doom as that of maurice cumming every shilling that maurice cumming could collect was spent in bribing negroes to work for him but bribe as he would the negroes would not work no massa me pain here me no workee to day and sambo would lay his fat hand on his fat stomach i have said that he lived generally alone occasionally his house on mount pleasant was enlivened by visits of an aunt a maiden sister of his mother whose usual residence was at spanish town it is or should be known to all men that spanish town was and is the seat of jamaica legislature but maurice was not over fond of his relative in this he was both wrong and foolish for miss sarah jack such was her name was in many respects a good woman and was certainly a rich woman it is true that she was not a handsome woman nor a fashionable woman nor perhaps altogether an agreeable woman she was tall thin ungainly and yellow her voice which she used freely was harsh she was a politician and a patriot she regarded england as the greatest of countries and jamaica as the greatest of colonies but much as she loved england she was very loud in denouncing what she called the perfidy of the mother to the brightest of her children and much as she loved jamaica she was equally severe in her taunts against those of her brother islanders who would not believe that the island might yet flourish as it had flourished in her father s days it is because you and men like you will not do your duty by your country she had said some score of times to maurice not with much justice considering the laboriousness of his life but maurice knew well what she meant what could i do there up at spanish town he would answer among such a pack as there are there here i may do something and then she would reply with the full swing of her eloquence it is because you and such as you think only of yourself and not of jamaica that jamaica has come to such a pass as this why is there a pack there as you call them in the honourable house of assembly why are not the best men in the island to be found there as the best men in england are to be found in the british house of commons a pack indeed my father was proud of a seat in that house and i remember the day maurice cumming when your father also thought it no shame to represent his own parish if men like you who have a stake in the country will not go there of course the house is filled with men who have no stake if they are a pack it is you who send them there you and others like you all had its effect though at the moment maurice would shrug his shoulders and turn away his head from the torrent of the lady s discourse but miss jack though she was not greatly liked was greatly respected maurice would not own that she convinced him but at last he did allow his name to be put up as candidate for his own parish and in due time he became a member of the honourable house of assembly in jamaica this honour entails on the holder of it the necessity of living at or within reach of spanish town for some ten weeks towards the chose of every year now on the whole face of the uninhabited globe there is perhaps no spot more dull to look at more lethean in its aspect more corpse like or more cadaverous than spanish town it is the head quarters of the government the seat of the legislature the residence of the governor but nevertheless it is as it were a city of the very dead here as we have said before lived miss jack in a large forlorn ghost like house in which her father and all her family had lived before her and as a matter of course maurice cumming when he came up to attend to his duties as a member of the legislature took up his abode with her now at the time of which we are specially speaking he had completed the first of these annual visits he had already benefited his country by sitting out one session of the colonial parliament and had satisfied himself that he did no other good than that of keeping away some person more objectionable than himself he was however prepared to repeat this self sacrifice in a spirit of patriotism for which he received a very meagre meed of eulogy from miss jack and an amount of self applause which was not much more extensive down at mount pleasant i can do something he would say over and over again but what good can any man do up here you can do your duty miss jack would answer as others did before you when the colony was made to prosper and then they would run off into a long discussion about free labour and protective duties but at the present moment maurice cumming had another vexation on his mind over and above that arising from his wasted hours at spanish town and his fruitless labours at mount pleasant he was in love and

with snow especially if there is a hard crust upon it the woods seem to possess a peculiar charm you can go anywhere then in the summer the thick undergrowth the intertwining vines and the heavy lower branches of the trees make it difficult even to see into the dark recesses of the forest but in the winter all is open the low wet places the deep holes the rotten bogs everything on the ground that is in the way of a good run and a jump is covered up you do not walk a hundred yards under the bare branches of the trees before up starts a rabbit or a hare if you would rather call him by his right name and away go the dogs and away you go all of you tearing along at the top of your speed but poor bunny has a small chance when a hard snow is on the ground his hiding places are all covered up and before he knows it the dogs have caught him and your mother will have stewed rabbit for supper it seems a hard fate for the poor little fellow but he was born partly for that purpose when you have caught your rabbit and come back to where the men are cutting wood you will be just as proud to tell the boy who is cutting up the branches all about your splendid hunt as if you had chased and killed a stag there s where we started him you will cry and away he scudded over there among the chestnuts and rover right at his heels and when we got down there to the creek rover turned heels over head on the ice he was going so fast but i gave one slide right across and just up there by the big walnut the other two dogs got him that boy is almost as much excited as you are and he would drop his axe in one minute and be off with you on another chase if his father were not there and now you find that you have reached the wood cutters exactly in time for that great tree is just about to come down

fertile land which seem to have been formed in this way exist at the present time along the banks of the rhine at various places these plains are all very highly cultivated and are rich and beautiful beyond description to see them however it is necessary to travel over them in a diligence or post chaise or by railway trains for in sailing up and down the river along the margin of them in a steam boat you are not high enough to overlook them you see nothing all the way in these places but a low green bank on each side of the river with a fringe of trees and shrubbery along the margin of it for about one hundred miles of its course however near the central portion of it the river flows through a very wild and mountainous district of country or rather through a district which was once wild though now even in the steepest slopes and declivities it is cultivated like a garden the reason why these mountainous regions are so highly cultivated is because the soil and climate are such that they produce the best and most delicious grapes in the world they have consequently from time immemorial been inhabited by a dense population every foot of ground where there is room for a vine to grow is valuable and where the slope was originally steep and rocky the peasants of former ages have gathered out the rocks and stones and built walls of them to terrace up the land the villages of these peasants too are seen every where nestling in the valleys and clinging to the sides of the hills while the summits of almost all the elevations are crowned with the ruins of old feudal castles

in descending but mr george met some friends of his on the frontier who persuaded him to make a short tour with them in germany and so come to the rhine at cologne we can then said he to rollo go up the river and see it in ascending which i think is the best way when we get through all the fine scenery which we shall do at mayence we can then go up to strasbourg and take the railroad there for paris the same way that we came yes said rollo i shall like that rollo liked it simply because it would make the journey longer when at length at the end of the tour in germany our travellers were approaching cologne on the rhine rollo began to look out some miles before they reached it to watch for the first appearance of the town he had been riding in the coup of the diligence with his uncle but now in order that he might see better he had changed his place and taken a seat on the banquette the banquette is a seat on the top of the coach and though it is covered above it is open in front and so it affords an excellent view mr george remained in the coup being very much interested in reading his guide book footnote the stage coaches on the continent of europe are called diligences at length rollo called out to tell his uncle that the city was in view the windows of the coup were open so that by leaning over and looking down he could speak to his uncle without any difficulty mr george was so busy reading his guide book that he paid little attention to what rollo said uncle george said rollo calling louder i can see the city and in the midst of it is a church with a great square tower and something very singular on the top of it mr george still continued his reading there is a spire on the top of the church continued rollo but it is bent down on one side entirely as if it had half blown over o no said mr george still continuing to read it really is said rollo i wish you would look uncle george it is something very singular indeed illustration cologne in sight mr george yielded at length to these importunities and looked out the country around in every direction was one vast plain covered with fields of grain luxuriant and beautiful beyond description it was without any fences or other divisions except such as were produced by different kinds of cultivation so that the view extended interminably in almost every direction there were rows and copses of trees here and there giving variety and life to the view and from among them were sometimes to be seen the spires of distant villages in the distance too in the direction in which rollo pointed lay the town of cologne the roofs of the houses extended over a very wide area and among them there was seen a dark square tower very high and crowned as rollo had said with what seemed to be a spire only it was bent over half way and there it lay at an angle at which no spire could possibly stand what can it mean asked rollo i am sure i do not know said mr george next to rollo on the banquette was seated a young man who had mounted up there about an hour before though rollo had not yet spoken to him rollo now however turned to him and asked him in english if he spoke english the young man smiled and shook his head implying that he did not understand rollo then asked him in french if he spoke french the young man said nein footnote pronounced nine rollo knew that nein was the german word for no and he presumed that the language of his fellow traveller was german so he pointed to the steeple and asked was ist das this phrase was ist das is the german of what is that rollo knew very little of german but he had learned this question long before having had occasion t,2

humming piazze where he inherited the eager life of his fathers is not the anxious voting with black and white beans still going on down there who are the priori in these months eating soberly regulated official dinners in the palazzo vecchio with removes of tripe and boiled partridges seasoned by practical jokes against the ill fated butt among those potent signors are not the significant banners still hung from the windows still distributed with decent pomp under orcagna s loggia every two months life had its zest for the old florentine when he too trod the marble steps and shared in those dignities his politics had an area as wide as his trade which stretched from syria to britain but they had also the passionate intensity and the detailed practical interest which could belong only to a narrow scene of corporate action only to the members of a community shut in close by the hills and by walls of six miles circuit where men knew each other as they passed in the street set their eyes every day on the memorials of their commonwealth and were conscious of having not simply the right to vote but the chance of being voted for he loved his honours and his gains the business of his counting house of his guild of the public council chamber he loved his enmities too and fingered the white bean which was to keep a hated name out of the borsa with more complacency than if it had been a golden florin he loved to strengthen his family by a good alliance and went home with a triumphant light in his eyes after concluding a satisfactory marriage for his son or daughter under

learned to distrust men without bitterness looking on life mainly as a game of skill but not dead to traditions of heroism and clean handed honour for the human soul is hospitable and will entertain conflicting sentiments and contradictory opinions with much impartiality it was his pride besides that he was duly tinctured with the learning of his age and judged not altogether with the vulgar but in harmony with the ancients he too in his prime had been eager for the most correct manuscripts and had paid many florins for antique vases and for disinterred busts of the ancient immortals some perhaps truncis naribus wanting as to the nose but not the less authentic and in his old age he had made haste to look at the first sheets of that fine homer which was among the early glories of the florentine press but he had not for all that neglected to hang up a waxen image or double of himself under the protection of the madonna annunziata or to do penance for his sins in large gifts to the shrines of saints whose lives had not been modelled on the study of the classics he had not even neglected making liberal bequests towards buildings for the frati against whom he had levelled many a

the libretto of an opera must be to a certain extent a mere vehicle for the music and that it is scarcely fair or reasonable to judge it by those strict rules of criticism which would be justly applicable to a five act tragedy or a finished comedy there is no doubt that the merits of the play were based upon the songs set to hullah s music rather than upon the play itself and it is said that harley s reputation as a vocalist was established by his able rendering of them the village coquettes enjoyed a run of nineteen nights in london during the season and was then transferred to edinburgh where it was performed under the management of mr ramsay a friend of sir walter scott sala as a boy of ten witnessed its first representation in london and ever retained a vivid impression of the event while especial interest appertains to the fact that a copy of the play became the means of first bringing dickens into personal communication with john forster his life long friend and biographer it is more than probable that boz felt a little elated by the reception accorded by the public to the dramatic bantling but as time progressed he realised that the somewhat unfavourable comments of the critics were not entirely devoid of truth indeed when in it was proposed to revive the play he expressed a hope that it might be allowed to sink into its native obscurity i did it he explained in a fit of damnable good nature long ago for hullah who wrote some very pretty music to it i just put down for everybody what everybody at the st james s theatre wanted to say and do and what they could say and do best and i have been most sincerely repentant ever since the novelist confessed that both the operetta and a little farce called the strange gentleman the latter written as a practical joke for the st james s theatre about the same time were done without the least consideration or regard to reputation he also declared that he wouldn t repeat them for a thousand pounds apiece and devoutly wished these early dramatic efforts to be forgotten x propos of this the late frederick locker lampson has recorded that when he asked dickens about a year before the great writer s death whether he possessed a copy of the village coquettes his reply was no and if i knew it was in my house and if i could not get rid of it in any other way i would burn the wing of the house where it was although perhaps not of a high order of merit the village coquettes is not without bibliographical interest and may be regarded as a musical and literary curiosity copies of the first

the very fire that warmed you when you were a babby was picked out of the river alongside the coal barges the very basket that you slept in the tide washed ashore the very rockers that i put it upon to make a cradle of it i cut out of a piece of wood that drifted from some ship or another lizzie took her right hand from the scull it held and touched her lips with it and for a moment held it out

have been developed from a common stock at least there is every reason to believe so but it is a most singular circumstance that while you may run through almost the whole series of physiological processes without finding a check to your argument you come at last to a point where you do find a check and that is in the reproductive processes for there is a most singular circumstance in respect to natural species at least about some of them and it would be sufficient for the purposes of this argument if it were true of only one of them but there is in fact a great number of such cases and that is that similar as they may appear to be to mere races or breeds they present a marked peculiarity in the reproductive process if you breed from the male and female of the same race you of course have offspring of the like kind and if you make the offspring breed together you obtain the same result and if you breed from these again you will still have the same kind of offspring there is no check but if you take members of two distinct species however similar they may be to each other and make them breed together you will find a check with some modifications and exceptions however which i shall speak of presently if you cross two such species with each other then although you may get offspring in the case of the first cross yet if you attempt to breed from the products of that crossing which are what are called hybrids that is if you couple a male and a female hybrid then the result is that in ninety nine cases out of a hundred you will get no offspring at all there will be no result whatsoever the reason of this is quite obvious in some cases the male hybrids although possessing all the external appearances and characteristics of perfect animals are physiologically imperfect and deficient in the structural parts of the reproductive elements necessary to generation it is said to be invariably the case with the male mule the cross between the ass and the mare and hence it is that although crossing the horse with the ass is easy enough and is constantly done as far as i am aware if you take two mules a male and a female and endeavour to breed from them you get no offspring whatever no generation will take place this is what is called the sterility of the hybrids between two distinct species you see that this is a very extraordinary circumstance one does not see why it should be the common teleological explanation is that it is to prevent the impurity of the blood resulting from the crossing of one species with another but you see it does not in reality do anything of the kind there is nothing in this fact that hybrids cannot breed with each other to establish such a theory there is nothing to prevent the horse breeding with the ass or the ass with the horse so that this explanation breaks down as a great many explanations of this kind do that are only founded on mere assumptions thus you see that there is a great difference between mongrels which are crosses between distinct races and hybrids which are crosses between distinct species the mongrels are so far as we know fertile with one another but between species in many cases you cannot succeed in obtaining even the first cross at any rate it is quite certain that the hybrids are often absolutely infertile one with another here is a feature then great or small as it may be which distinguishes natural species of animals can we find any approximation to this in the different races known to be produced by selective breeding from a common stock up to the present time the answer to that question is absolutely a negative one as far as we know at present there is nothing approximating to this check in crossing the breeds between the fantail and the pouter the carrier and the tumbler or any other variety or race you may name so far as we know at present there is no difficulty in breeding together the mongrels take the carrier and the fantail for instance and let them represent the horse and the ass in the case of distinct species then you have as the result of their breeding the carrier fantail mongrel we will say the male and female mongrel and as far as we know these two when crossed would not be less fertile than the original cross or than carrier with carrier here you see is a physiological contrast between the races produced by selective modification and natural species i shall inquire into the value of this fact and of some modifying circumstances by and by for the present i merely put it broadly before you but while considering this question of the limitations of species a word must be said about what is called recurrence the tendency of races which have been developed by selective breeding from varieties to return to their primitive type this is supposed by many to put an absolute limit to the extent of selective and all other variations people say it is all very well to talk about producing these different races but you know very well that if you turned all these birds wild these pouters and carriers and so on they would all return to their primitive stock this is very commonly assumed to be a fact and it is an argument that is commonly brought forward as conclusive but if you will take the trouble to inquire into it rather closely i think you will find that it is not worth very much the first question of course is do they thus return to the primitive stock and commonly as the thing is assumed and accepted it is extremely difficult to get anything like good evidence of it it is constantly said for example that if domesticated horses are turned wild as they have been in some parts of asia minor and south america that they return at once to the primitive stock from which they were bred but the,2

mind to regard anything belonging to them as extraordinary or out of rule there is not a port in the whole country that is less indebted to art and the fostering hand of government than this it is true certain forts most of them of very doubtful necessity have been constructed for defence but no attack having ever been contemplated or if contemplated attempted they have been dead letters in the history of its progress we are not aware that government has ever expended one cent in the waters of manhattan except for the surveys construction of the aforesaid military works and the erection of the lighthouses that form a part of the general provision for the safe navigation of the entire coast some money has been expended for the improvement of the shallow waters of the hudson but it has been as much or more for the advantage of the upper towns and the trade coastwise generally than for the special benefit of new york the immense natural advantages of the bays and islands at the mouth of the hudson have in a great degree superseded the necessity of such assistance nature has made every material provision for a mart of the first importance and perhaps it has been fortunate that the towns have been left like healthful and vigorous children managed by prudent parents to take the inclination and growth pointed out to them by this safest and best of guides london is indebted to artificial causes in a great degree for its growth and power that great law of trade which renders settling places indispensable has contributed to her prosperity and continued ascendency long after the day when rival ports are carrying away her fleets and commerce she is a proof of the difficulty of shaking a commercial superiority long established scarce a cargo that enters the ports of the kingdom that does not pay tribute to her bankers or merchants but london is a political capital and that in a country where the representation of the government is more imposing possessing greater influence than in any other christian nation the english aristocracy which wields the real authority of the state here makes its annual exhibition of luxury and wealth such as the world has never beheld anywhere else ancient rome possibly excepted and has had a large share in rendering london what it is new york has none of this adventitious aid both of the governments that of the united states and that of the state have long been taken from her leaving her nothing of this sort but her own local authorities but representation forms no part of the machinery of american policy it is supposed that man is too intellectual and philosophical to need it in this intellectual and philosophical country par excellence although such is the theory the whole struggle in private life is limited to the impression made by representation in the hands of individuals that which the government has improvidently cast aside society has seized upon and hundreds who have no claim to distinction beyond the possession of money profit by the mistake to place themselves in positions perhaps that they are not always exactly qualified to fill of all social usurpations that of mere money is the least tolerable as one may have a very full purse with empty brains and vulgar tastes and habits the wisdom of thus throwing the control of a feature of society that is of much more moment than is commonly supposed into the chapter of commercial accidents may well he questioned some crude attempts have been made to bring the circles of new york within the control of a code

and clean only as decency might require not nicely clean with feminine care the very stuff of which they were made was brown rather than white and her dress was always the same it was rough and black and clinging disagreeable to the eye in its shape as will always be the dress of any woman which is worn day after day through all hours by nature and education mrs prime was a prim tidy woman but it seemed that her peculiar ideas of duty required her to militate against her nature and education at any rate in appearance and this was her lot in life before she had yet reached her twentieth year dorothea ray had not been wanting in some feminine attraction she had ever been brown and homely but her features had been well formed and her eyes had been bright now as she approached to thirty years of age she might have been as well looking as at any earlier period of her life if it had been her wish to possess good looks but she had had no such wish on the contrary her desire had been to be ugly forbidding unattractive almost repulsive so that in very truth she might be known to be a widow indeed and here i must not be misunderstood there was nothing hypocritical about mrs prime nor did she make any attempt to appear before men to be weighted with a deeper sorrow than that which she truly bore hypocrisy was by no means her fault her fault was this that she had taught herself to believe that cheerfulness was a sin and that the more she became morose the nearer would she be to the fruition of those hopes of future happiness on which her heart was set in all her words and thoughts she was genuine but then in so very many of them she was mistaken this was the wall against which mrs ray had allowed herself to be fastened for many years past and though the support was strong it must be admitted that it could hardly have been at all times pleasant mrs ray had become a widow before she was thirty and she had grieved for her husband with truest sorrow pouring herself out at first in tears and afterwards expending herself in long hours of vain regrets but she had never been rough or hard in her widowhood it had ever been her nature to be soft she was a woman all over and had about her so much of a woman s prettiness that she had not altogether divested herself of it even when her weepers had been of the broadest to obtain favour in men s eyes had never been in her mind since she had first obtained favour in the eyes of him who had been her lord but yet she had never absolutely divested herself of her woman charms of that look half retreating half beseeching which had won the heart of the ecclesiastical lawyer gradually her weeds and her deep heavy crapes had fallen away from her and then without much thought on the matter she dressed herself much as did other women of forty or forty five being driven however on certain occasions by her daughter to a degree of dinginess not by any means rivalling that of the daughter herself but which she would not have achieved had she been left to her own devices she was a sweet tempered good humoured loving timid woman ever listening and believing and learning with a certain aptitude for gentle mirth at her heart which however was always being repressed and controlled by the circumstances of her life she could gossip over a cup of tea and enjoy buttered toast and hot cake very thoroughly if only there was no one near her to whisper into her ear that any such enjoyment was wicked in spite of the sorrows she had suffered she would have taught herself to believe this world to be a pleasant place were it not so often preached into her ears that it is a vale of tribulation in which no satisfaction can abide and it may be said of mrs ray that her religion though it sufficed her tormented her grievously it sufficed her and if on such a subject i may venture to give an opinion i think it was of a nature to suffice her in that great strait for which it had been prepared but in this world it tormented her carrying her hither and thither and leaving her in grievous doubt not as to its own truth in any of its details but as to her own conduct under its injunctions and also as to her own mode of believing in it in truth she believed too much she could never divide the minister from the bible nay the very clerk in the church was sacred to her while exercising his functions therein it never occurred to her to question any word that was said to her if a linen draper were to tell her that one coloured calico was better for her than another she would take that point as settled by the man s word and for the time would be free from all doubt on that heading so also when the clergyman in his sermon told her that she should live simply and altogether for heaven that all thoughts as to this world were wicked thoughts and that nothing belonging to this world could be other than painful full of sorrow and vexations she would go home believing him absolutely and with tear laden eyes would bethink herself how utterly she was a castaway because of that tea and cake and innocent tittle tattle with which the hours of her saturday evening had been beguiled she would weakly resolve that she would laugh no more and that she would live in truth in a valley of tears but then as the bright sun came upon her and the birds sang around her and some one that she loved would cling to her and kiss her she would be happy in her own despite and would laugh with a low musical sweet tone forgetting that such laughter was a sin and then that very clergyman himself would torment her he that told her from the pulpit on sundays how frightfully vain were all attempts at worldly happiness he would come to her on the monday with a good natured rather rubicund face and would ask after all her little worldly belongings for he kne,2

into doors and windows then after a moment s pause she added if we should mark the place on the floor all the year round we should find what time the sun is farthest to the south so we should said rollo it would be in the winter said lucy yes said rollo in the middle of the winter exactly yes said lucy and in the middle of the summer it would be nearest overhead jonas and i will try it said rollo i can try it in the house said lucy where the sun shines in at my chamber window o no said rollo that won t do why not said lucy because the window does not come down to the floor and so does not let the sun in enough o that makes no difference said lucy we have nothing to do with the bottom of the door you only mark where it shines in the farthest and that place is made by the top of the door for it shines in farthest by the top of the door well said rollo i don t know but that the house will do but then you can t chalk on the carpet chalk on the carpet said lucy yes to mark the place no said lucy thinking but i can mark it some other way how asked rollo why i can put a pin in said lucy o dear said rollo with a laugh put a pin in that s no way to mark a shadow it isn t a shadow said lucy yes it is said rollo no said lucy a shadow is dark and this is bright yes said rollo this is a bright shadow some shadows are bright and some are dark o rollo said lucy and she turned away from him a little out of humor the truth was that rollo and lucy were getting decidedly into a dispute from the sublime heights of practical astronomy they had fallen by a sad and very rapid descent to a childish altercation rollo had a very high idea of the superior facilities afforded by jonas s barn floor for observing the daily changes in the sun s meridian altitude and he did not like the idea of lucy s finding that she had equally good opportunities for observation at her home lucy was a little fretted at rollo s captious spirit but then her mind soon became unruffled again and she turned back towards rollo and said as they walked along the yard i don t think the sunshine on the floor is a shadow rollo but then i don t see why a shadow would not do just as well how said rollo why look there at the shadow of that post that would do she pointed to a post with a rounded top upon it which stood by the side of the garden gate the shadow clear distinct and well defined was projected upon the walk and lucy told rollo that they might mark the place where the top of that shadow came every day and that that would do just as well but how could we mark it said rollo why we could drive a little stake unto the ground o that would not do said rollo people would trip over them and break them down they would be exactly in the walk lucy saw that this would be a difficulty and for a moment seemed to be at a loss at length she said we might go somewhere else then where the people would not come but what should we do for a post said rollo could not we get jonas to drive a tall stake down said lucy yes said rollo i suppose so the children went out into the garden to find a good smooth place and while they were walking about there rollo s mother came out and they told her the whole story she seemed quite interested in the plan and told them of a better way than any that they had thought of you see said she that the height of the stake or pole that makes the shadow is not material for the shadow of a small one will vary just as much in proportion to its length as that of a long one will so instead of taking a wooden stake out of doors you might take a large pin and drive it down a little way into the window sill in the house then you can mark the shadow with a pen very exactly so we can said lucy clapping her hands and you might put a piece of white paper or a card down first continued rollo s mother and drive the pin through that and then mark the places where the end of the shadow comes every day directly on the card with a fine pen thus you could be a great deal more exact than you can in chalking upon a barn floor rollo asked his mother if she would not be kind enough to help them fix their apparatus but she said she would give them particular directions though she should prefer letting them do the whole themselves and then if they met with any difficulties they might come and report them to her and she would tell them how to surmount them so she recommended to them to go and find a blank card or piece of white pasteboard or of stiff white paper as big as a common card then said she choose some window where the sun shines in at noon and put the card down upon the sill and drive the pin down through it but you must not drive the pin through the middle of the card for the shadow will always be off to the north of the pin and therefore the pin may be pretty near the south end of the card then the shadow will be more likely to come wholly upon the card even when it is longest you had better place the card in such a position too that its sides shall lie in the direction of north and south then the shadow at noon will lie along exactly in the middle of it you must get a large and stout pin too and drive it in firmly a little way with a small hammer it will be well too to drive another smaller pin into the other end of the card so as to keep it fixed in its north and south position how can we know when it is north and south exactly said lucy you cannot do it exactly said rollo s mother but you can get it pretty near one way is to borrow father s little compass and adjust it by that another way is to see when it is exactly twelv,2

was as worthy of note as the ultimate object to which you were journeying it is possible indeed that coleridge did not in fact possess the precise gladiatorial power of johnson yet he understood a sword play of his own and i have upon several occasions seen him exhibit brilliant proofs of its effectiveness upon disputants of considerable pretensions in their particular lines but he had a genuine dislike of the practice in himself or others and no slight provocation could move him to any such exertion he was indeed to my observation more distinguished from other great men of letters by his moral thirst after the truth the ideal truth in his own mind than by his merely intellectual qualifications to leave the everyday circle of society in which the literary and scientific rarely the rest never break through the spell of personality where anecdote reigns everlastingly paramount and exclusive and the mildest attempt to generalize the babel of facts and to control temporary and individual phenomena by the application of eternal and overruling principles is unintelligible to many and disagreeable to more to leave this species of converse if converse it deserves to be called and pass an entire day with coleridge was a marvellous change indeed it was a sabbath past expression deep and tranquil and serene you came to a man who had travelled in many countries and in critical times who had seen and felt the world in most of its ranks and in many of its vicissitudes and weaknesses one to whom all literature and genial art were absolutely subject and to whom with a reasonable allowance as to technical details all science was in a most extraordinary degree familiar throughout a long drawn summer s day would this man talk to you in low equable but clear and musical tones concerning things human and divine marshalling all history harmonizing all experiment probing the depths of your consciousness and revealing visions of glory and of terror to the imagination but pouring withal such floods of light upon the mind that you might for a season like paul become blind in the very act of conversion and this he would do without so much as one allusion to himself without a word of reflection on others save when any given act fell naturally in the way of his discourse without one anecdote that was not proof and illustration of a previous position gratifying no passion indulging no caprice but with a calm mastery over your soul leading you onward and onward for ever through a thousand windings yet with no pause to some magnificent point in which as in a focus all the party coloured rays of his discourse should converge in light in all this he was in truth your teacher and guide but in a little while you might forget that he was other than a fellow student and the companion of your way so playful was his manner so simple his language so affectionate the glance of his pleasant eye there were indeed some whom coleridge tired and some whom he sent asleep it would occasionally so happen when the abstruser mood was strong upon him and the visiter was narrow and ungenial i have seen him at times when you could not incarnate him when he shook aside your petty questions or doubts and burst with some impatience through the obstacles of common conversation then escaped from the flesh he would soar upwards into an atmosphere almost too rare to breathe but which seemed proper to him and there he would float at ease like enough what coleridge then said his subtlest listener would not understand as a man understands a newspaper but upon such a listener there would steal an influence and an impression and a sympathy there would be a gradual attempering of his body and spirit till his total being vibrated with one pulse alone and thought became merged in contemplation and so his senses gradually wrapt in a half sleep he d dream of better worlds and dreaming hear thee still o singing lark that sangest like an angel in the clouds but it would be a great mistake to suppose that the general character of mr coleridge s conversation was abstruse or rhapsodical the contents of the following pages may i think be taken as pretty strong presumptive evidence that his ordinary manner was plain and direct enough and even when as sometimes happened he seemed to ramble from the road and to lose himself in a wilderness of digressions the truth was that at that very time he was working out his fore known conclusion through an almost miraculous logic the difficulty of which consisted precisely in the very fact of its minuteness and universality he took so large a scope that if he was interrupted before he got to the end he appeared to have been talking without an object although perhaps a few steps more would have brought you to a point a retrospect from which would show you the pertinence of all he had been saying i have heard persons complain that they could get no answer to a question from coleridge the truth is he answered or meant to answer so fully that the querist should have no second question to ask in nine cases out of ten he saw the question was short or misdirected and knew that a mere yes or no answer could not embrace the truth that is the whole truth and might very probably by implication convey error hence that exhaustive cyclical mode of discoursing in which he frequently indulged unfit indeed for a dinner table and too long breathed for the patience of a chance visiter but which to those who knew for what they came was the object of their profoundest admiration as it was the source of their most valuable instruction mr coleridge s affectionate disciples learned their lessons of philosophy and criticism from his own mouth he was to them as an old master of the academy or lyceum the,2

preparing tumblers of punch others sitting at the windows of different parlors some with faces flushed puffing cigars the bill of fare for the day was stuck up beside the bar opposite this principal hotel there was another called the mechanics which seemed to be equally thronged i suspect that the company were about on a par in each for at the maverick house though well dressed they seemed to be merely sunday gentlemen mostly young fellows clerks in dry goods stores being the aristocracy of them one very fashionable in appearance with a handsome cane happened to stop by me and lift up his foot and i noticed that the sole of his boot which was exquisitely polished was all worn out i apprehend that some such minor deficiencies might have been detected in the general showiness of most of them there were girls too but not pretty ones nor on the whole such good imitations of gentility as the young men there were as many people as are usually collected at a muster or on similar occasions lounging about without any apparent enjoyment but the observation of this may serve me to make a sketch of the mode of spending the sabbath by the majority of unmarried young middling class people near a great town most of the people had smart canes and bosom pins crossing the ferry into boston we went to the city tavern where the bar room presented a sabbath scene of repose stage folk lounging in chairs half asleep smoking cigars generally with clean linen and other niceties of apparel to mark the day the doors and blinds of an oyster and refreshment shop across the street were closed but i saw people enter it there were two owls in a back court visible through a window of the bar room speckled gray with dark blue eyes the queerest looking birds that exist so solemn and wise dozing away the day much like the rest of the people only that they looked wiser than any others their hooked beaks looked like hooked noses a dull scene this a stranger here and there poring over a newspaper many of the stage folk sitting in chairs on the pavement in front of the door we went to the top of the hill which formed part of gardiner greene s estate and which is now in the process of levelling and pretty much taken away except the highest point and a narrow path to ascend to it it gives an admirable view of the city being almost as high as the steeples and the dome of the state house and overlooking the whole mass of brick buildings and slated roofs with glimpses of streets far below it was really a pity to take it down i noticed the stump of a very large elm recently felled no house

been disturbed while nursing her child she answered us with great kindness entering the burial ground where some masons were building a tomb we found a good many old monuments and several covered with slabs of red freestone or slate and with arms sculptured on the slab or an inlaid circle of slate on one slate gravestone of the rev nathl rogers there was a portrait of that worthy about a third of

expression and confounds them with those whose province is action but who quit it to imitate the sayers but homer s words are as costly and admirable to homer as agamemnon s victories are to agamemnon the poet does not wait for the hero or the sage but as they act and think primarily so he writes primarily what will and must be spoken reckoning the others though primaries also yet in respect to him secondaries and servants as sitters or models in the studio of a painter or as assistants who bring building materials to an architect for poetry was all written before time was and whenever we are so finely organized that we can penetrate into that region where the air is music we hear those primal warblings and attempt to write them down but we lose ever and anon a word or a verse and substitute something of our own and thus miswrite the poem the men of more delicate ear write down these cadences more faithfully and these transcripts though imperfect become the songs of the nations for nature is as truly beautiful as it is good or as it is reasonable and must as much appear as it must be done or be known words and deeds are quite indifferent modes of the divine energy words are also actions and actions are a kind of words the sign and credentials of the poet are that he announces that which no man foretold he is the true and only doctor he knows and tells he is the only teller of news for he was present and privy to the appearance which he describes he is a beholder of ideas and an utterer of the necessary and causal for we do not speak now of men of poetical talents or of industry and skill in metre but of the true poet i took part in a conversation the other day concerning a recent writer of lyrics a man of subtle mind whose head appeared to be a music box of delicate tunes and rhythms and whose skill and command of language we could not sufficiently praise but when the question arose whether he was not only a lyrist but a poet we were obliged to confess that he is plainly a contemporary not an eternal man he does not stand out of our low limitations like a chimborazo under the line running up from the torrid base through all the climates of the globe with belts of the herbage of every latitude on its high and mottled sides but this genius is the landscape garden of a modern house adorned with fountains and statues with well bred men and women standing and sitting in the walks and terraces we hear through all the varied music the ground tone of conventional life our poets are men of talents who sing and not the children of music the argument is secondary the finish of the verses is primary for it is not metres but a metre making argument that makes a poem a thought so passionate and alive that like the spirit of a plant or an animal it has an architecture of its own and adorns nature with a new thing the thought and the form are equal in the order of time but in the order of genesis the thought is prior to the form the poet has a new thought he has a whole new experience to unfold he will tell us how it was with him and all men will be the richer in his fortune for the experience of each new age requires a new confession and the world seems always waiting for its poet i remember when i was young how much i was moved one morning by tidings that genius had appeared in a youth who sat near me at table he had left his work and gone rambling none knew whither and had written hundreds of lines but could not tell whether that which was in him was therein told he could tell nothing but that all was changed man beast heaven earth and sea how gladly we listened how credulous society seemed to be compromised we sat in the aurora of a sunrise which was to put out all the stars boston seemed to be at twice the distance it had the night before or was much farther than that rome what was rome plutarch and shakspeare were in the yellow leaf and homer no more should be heard of it is much to know that poetry has been written this very day under this very roof by your side what that wonderful spirit has not expired these stony moments are still sparkling and animated i had fancied that the oracles were all silent and nature had spent her fires and behold all night from every pore these fine auroras have been streaming every one has some interest in the advent of the poet and no one knows how much it may concern him we know that the secret of the world is profound but who or what shall be our interpreter we know not a mountain ramble a new style of face a new person may put the key into our hands of course the value of genius to us is in the veracity of its report talent may frolic and juggle genius realizes and adds mankind in good earnest have availed so far in understanding themselves and their work that the foremost watchman on the peak announces his news it is the truest word ever spoken and the phrase will be the fittest most musical and the unerring voice of the world for that time all that we call sacred history attests that the birth of a poet is the principal event in chronology man never so often deceived still watches for the arrival of a brother who can hold him steady to a truth until he has made it his own with what joy i begin to read a poem which i confide in as an inspiration and now my chains are to be broken i shall mount above these clouds and opaque airs in

when crossed by a distinct species than when fertilised by its proper pollen on the other hand the famous gaertner though he took the greatest pains to cross the primrose and the cowslip succeeded only once or twice in several years and yet it is a well established fact that the primrose and the cowslip are only varieties of the same kind of plant again such cases as the following are well established the female of species a if crossed with the male of species b is fertile but if the female of b is crossed with the male of a she remains barren facts of this kind destroy the value of the supposed criterion if weary of the endless difficulties involved in the determination of species the investigator contenting himself with the rough practical distinction of separable kinds endeavours to study them as they occur in nature to ascertain their relations to the conditions which surround them their mutual harmonies and discordances of structure the bond of union of their parts and their past history he finds himself according to the received notions in a mighty maze and with at most the dimmest adumbration of a plan if he starts with any one clear conviction it is that every part of a living creature is cunningly adapted to some special use in its life has not his paley told him that that seemingly useless organ the spleen is beautifully adjusted as so much packing between the other organs and yet at the outset of his studies he finds that no adaptive reason whatsoever can be given for one half of the peculiarities of vegetable structure he also discovers rudimentary teeth which are never used in the gums of the young calf and in those of the foetal whale insects which never bite have rudimental jaws and others which never fly have rudimental wings naturally blind creatures have rudimental eyes and the halt have rudimentary limbs so again no animal or plant puts on its perfect form at once but all have to start from the same point however various the course which each has to pursue not only men and horses and cats and dogs lobsters and beetles periwinkles and mussels but even the very sponges and animalcules commence their existence under forms which are essentially undistinguishable and this is true of all the infinite variety of plants nay more all living beings march side by side along the high road of development and separate the later the more like they are like people leaving church who all go down the aisle but having reached the door some turn into the parsonage others go down the village and others part only in the next parish a man in his development runs for a little while parallel with though never passing through the form of the meanest worm then travels for a space beside the fish then journeys along with the bird and the reptile for his fellow travellers and only at last after a brief companionship with the highest of the four footed and four handed world rises into the dignity of pure manhood no competent thinker of the present day dreams of explaining these indubitable facts by the notion of the existence of unknown and undiscoverable adaptations to purpose and we would remind those who ignorant of the facts must be moved by authority that no one has asserted the incompetence of the doctrine of final causes in its application to physiology and anatomy more strongly than our own eminent anatomist professor owen who speaking of such cases says on the nature of limbs pp i think it will be obvious that the principle of final adaptations fails to satisfy all the conditions of the problem but if the doctrine of final causes will not help us to comprehend the anomalies of living structure the principle of adaptation must surely lead us to understand why certain living beings are found in certain regions of the world and not in others the palm as we know will not grow in our climate nor the oak in greenland the white bear cannot live where the tiger thrives nor vice versa and the more the natural habits of animal and vegetable species are examined the more do they seem on the whole limited to particular provinces but when we look into the facts established by the study of the geographical distribution of animals and plants it seems utterly hopeless to attempt to understand the strange and apparently capricious relations which they exhibit one would be inclined to suppose a priori that every country must be naturally peopled by those animals that are fittest to live and thrive in it and yet how on this hypothesis are we to account for the absence of cattle in the pampas of south america when those parts of the new world were discovered it is not that they were unfit for cattle for millions of cattle now run wild there and the like holds good of australia and new zealand it is a curious circumstance in fact that the animals and plants of the northern hemisphere are not only as well adapted to live in the southern hemisphere as its own autochthones but are in many cases absolutely better adapted and so overrun and extirpate the aborigines clearly therefore the species which naturally inhabit a country are not necessarily the best adapted to its climate and other conditions the inhabitants of islands are often distinct from any other known species of animal or plants witness our recent examples from the work of sir emerson tennent on ceylon and yet they have almost always a sort of general family resemblance to the animals and plants of the nearest mainland on the other hand there is hardly a species of fish shell or crab common to the opposite sides of the narrow isthmus of panama wherever we look then living nature offers us riddles of difficult solution if we suppose that what we see is all that can be known,2

to this but nothing shall be said here it is merely of the cruelty of spirit that is thus engendered that we now speak success is the only test of merit words have lost their old significance and to deserve only is not meritorious v victis there are so many of them thompson says johnson the young poet when he has at last succeeded in getting the bosomest of his friends alone into his chamber with him have you happened to look at my iphigenia yet thompson can t say that he has he has been busy has had so many water parties and then somehow he doesn t think that he is very partial to modern poetry on subjects of old mythology of course however he means to read it some of these days i wish you would says johnson tendering a copy of the thin volume i really wish you would and let me have your candid opinion the press certainly have not noticed it much and what they have said has been very luke warm i am sorry for that says thompson looking grave and i did my best with it too you would hardly believe how hard i worked at it there is not a line that has not been weighed and written perhaps three times over i do not think i am conceited but i cannot but believe that there is something in it the reviewers are so jealous if a man has not a name they will give him credit for nothing and it is so hard to begin i am sure it is says thompson i don t expect fame and as for money of course i don t think of that but i should like to know that it had been read by one or two persons who could understand it i have given to it the best of my time the best of my labour i cannot but think that there is something in it thus pleads the unsuccessful one for mercy and thus answers to him the successful one with no grain of mercy in his composition my dear johnson my maxim is this that in this world every man gets in the long run exactly what he deserves did milton get what he deserved these are not the days of milton i don t want to hurt your feelings but old friends as we are i should not forgive myself if i didn t tell you what i really think poetry is all very well but you can t create a taste for it if it doesn t exist nobody that i know of cares a d for iphigenia you think i should change my subject then to tell you the truth i think you should change your trade this is the third attempt you know i dare say they are very good in their way but if the world liked them the world would have found it out by this time vox populi vox dei that is my motto i don t trust my own judgment i trust that of the public if you will take my advice you will give up iphigenia and the rest of them you see you are doing nothing whatever at the bar c c and thus johnson is left without a scrap of comfort a word of consolation a spark of sympathy and yet he had given to that iphigenia of his the best that was in him to give had his publisher sold ten thousand copies of it how thompson would have admired it how he would have pressed the poet in his arms and have given him champagne up at richmond but who now has sympathy for failure to fail is to be disgraced v victis there is something very painful in these races which we english are always running to one who has tenderness enough to think of the nine beaten horses instead of the one who has conquered look at that list which has just come out after our grand national struggle at cambridge how many wranglers are there thirty shall we say and it is always glorious to be a wrangler out of that thirty there is probably but one who has not failed who is not called on to submit to the inward grief of having been beaten the youth who is second who has thus shown himself to be possessed of a mass of erudition sufficient to crush an ordinary mind to the earth is ready to eat his heart with true bitterness of spirit after all his labour his midnight oil his many sleepless nights his deserted pleasures his racking headaches amaryllis abandoned and ne ra seen in the arms of another after all this to be beaten by jones had it been green or smith he could have borne it would it not have been better to do as others had done he could have been contented to have gone out in the crowd but there is nothing so base as to be second and then second to jones out of the whole lot jones alone is contented and he is told by his physician that he must spend his next two winters at cairo the intensity of his application has put his lungs into very serious jeopardy it was at oxford in the year that a young man sat in his college rooms at balliol a wretched victim to unsuccessful competition it had been everything to him to come out as a first in classics and he had dared to dream even of a double first but he had failed in both the lists had just appeared and he was only a second class man now a second class man is not

is it at steamboat wharves there are differences however after you had left i stood and sympathised with those around me and observed that there is usually more emotion on a wharf than on a platform naturally enough as in the case of long sea voyages partings it may be presumed are for longer periods and dangers are supposed to be greater and more numerous than in land journeys though this is open to question the waiting process too is prolonged even after the warning bell had sent non voyagers ashore they had to stand for a considerable time in the rain while we cast off our moorings or went through some of those incomprehensible processes by which a leviathan steamer is moved out of dock after having made a first false move which separated us about three yards from the wharf inducing the wearied friends on shore to brighten up and smile and kiss hands and wave kerchiefs with that energy of decision which usually marks a really final farewell our steamer remained in that position for full half an hour during which period we gazed from the bulwarks and our friends gazed from under their dripping umbrellas across the now impassable gulf in mute resignation at that moment a great blessing befell us a boy let his cap drop from the wharf into the water it was an insignificant matter in itself but it acted like the little safety valve which prevents the bursting of a high pressure engine voyagers and friends no longer looked at each other like melancholy imbeciles a gleam of intense interest suffused every visage intelligence sparkled in every eye as we turned and concentrated our attention on that cap the unexpressed blessing of the whole company ashore and afloat descended on the uncovered head of that boy who all unconscious of the great end he was fulfilling made frantic and futile efforts with a long piece of stick to recover his lost property but we did at last get under weigh and then there were some touches of real pathos i felt no disposition to note the humorous elements around when i saw that overgrown lad of apparently eighteen summers press to the side and wave his thin hands in adieu to an elderly lady on shore while tears that he could not and evidently did not care to restrain ran down his hollow cheeks he had no friend on board and was being sent to the cape for the benefit of his health so too was another young man somewhere between twenty and thirty years whose high colour brilliant eye and feeble step told their own tale but this man was not friendless his young wife was there and supported him with tender solicitude towards a seat these two were in the after cabin among the steerage passengers the fell disease was represented in the person of a little boy too late was written on the countenances of at least two of these the married man and the little boy as to the healthy passengers what shall i say of them need i tell you that every species of humanity was represented there were tall men and short men as well as men broad and narrow mentally not less than physically there were ladies pretty and ladies plain as well as grave and gay fat and funny ones we had also lean ones and sad the wise and foolish virgins were represented so too were smokers and drinkers and not a few earnest loving and lovable men and women a tendency had been gaining on me of late to believe that after passing middle life a man cannot make new and enthusiastic friendships never was i more mistaken it is now my firm conviction that men may and do make friendships of the closest kind up to the end of their career of course the new friends do not and cannot take the place of the old it seems to me that they serve a higher purpose and by enabling one to realise the difference between the old and the new draw the cords of ancient friendship tighter at all events you may depend upon it my dear periwinkle that no new friend shall ever tumble you out of the niche which you occupy in my bosom but be this as it may it is a fact that in my berth which held four and was full all the voyage there was a tall dark powerful middle aged man an englishman born in cape colony see note who had been home for a trip and was on his way out again to his african home on the great karroo this man raised within me feelings of disgust when i first saw him in the dim light of our berth because he was big and i knew that a big man requires more air to fill his lungs than a little one and there was no superabundant air in our berth quite the reverse this man occupied the top berth opposite to mine each morning as i awoke my eyes fell on his beard of iron grey and i gazed at his placid countenance till he awoke or i found his placid countenance gazing at me when i awoke from gazing to nodding in recognition is an easy step in ordinary circumstances but not when one s head is on one s pillow we therefore passed at once without the ceremony of nodding into a quiet good morning although reticent he gradually added a smile to the good morning and i noticed that his smile was a peculiarly pleasant one steps that succeed the first are generally easy from disliking this man not on personal but purely selfish grounds i came to like him then to love him i have reason to believe that the attachment was mutual his name why should i not state it i don t think he would object is hobson in the bunk below hobson lay a young wesleyan minister he was a slender young fellow modest and thoughtful if hobson s bunk had given way i fear that his modesty and thoughtfulness might have been put to a severe test i looked down

fruitless speculations the residue of his fortune in partnership with mr rubb all that happened long ago he was now a man of nearly fifty living with his wife and family a family of six or seven children in a house in gower street and things had not gone with him very well nor is it necessary to say very much of walter mackenzie who had been four years younger than his brother he had stuck to the office in spite of his wealth and as he had never married he had been a rich man during his father s lifetime and when he was quite young he had for a while shone in the world of fashion having been patronised by the mackenzie baronet and by others who thought that a clerk from somerset house with twelve thousand pounds must be a very estimable fellow he had not however shone in a very brilliant way he had gone to parties for a year or two and during those years had essayed the life of a young man about town frequenting theatres and billiard rooms and doing a few things which he should have left undone and leaving undone a few things which should not have been so left but as i have said he was weak in body as well as weak in mind early in life he became an invalid and though he kept his place in somerset house till he died the period of his shining in the fashionable world came to a speedy end now at length we will come to margaret mackenzie the sister our heroine who was eight years younger than her brother walter and twelve years younger than mr rubb s partner she had been little more than a child when her father died or i might more correctly say that though she had then reached an age which makes some girls young women it had not as yet had that effect upon her she was then nineteen but her life in her father s house had been dull and monotonous she had gone very little into company and knew very little of the ways of the world the mackenzie baronet people had not noticed her they had failed to make much of walter with his twelve thousand pounds and did not trouble themselves with margaret who had no fortune of her own the ball baronet people were at extreme variance with all her family and as a matter of course she received no countenance from them in those early days she did not receive much countenance from any one and perhaps i may say that she had not shown much claim for such countenance as is often given to young ladies by their richer relatives she was neither beautiful nor clever nor was she in any special manner made charming by any of those softnesses and graces of youth which to some girls seem to atone for a want of beauty and cleverness at the age of nineteen i may almost say that margaret mackenzie was ungainly her brown hair was rough and did not form itself into equal lengths her cheek bones were somewhat high after the manner of the mackenzies she was thin and straggling in her figure with bones larger than they should have been for purposes of youthful grace there was not wanting a certain brightness to her grey eyes but it was a brightness as to the use of which she had no early knowledge at this time her father lived at camberwell and i doubt whether the education which margaret received at miss green s establishment for young ladies in that suburb was of a kind to make up by art for that which nature had not given her this school too she left at an early age at a very early age as her age went when she was nearly sixteen her father who was then almost an old man became ill and the next three years she spent in nursing him when he died she was transferred to her younger brother s house to a house which he had taken in one of the quiet streets leading down from the strand to the river in order that he might be near his office and here for fifteen years she had lived eating his bread and nursing him till he also died and so she was alone in the world during those fifteen years her life had been very weary a moated grange in the country is bad enough for the life of any mariana but a moated grange in town is much worse her life in london had been altogether of the moated grange kind and long before her brother s death it had been very wearisome to her i will not say that she was always waiting for some one that came not or that she declared herself to be aweary or that she wished that she were dead but the mode of her life was as near that as prose may be near to poetry or truth to romance for the coming of one who as things fell out in that matter soon ceased to come at all to her she had for a while been anxious there was a young clerk then in somerset house one harry handcock by name who had visited her brother in the early days of that long sickness and harry handcock had seen beauty in those grey eyes and the straggling uneven locks had by that time settled themselves into some form of tidiness and the big joints having been covered had taken upon themselves softer womanly motions and the sister s tenderness to the brother had been appreciated harry handcock had spoken a word or two margaret being then five and twenty and harry ten years her senior harry had spoken and margaret had listened only too willingly but the sick brother upstairs had become cross and peevish such a thing should never take place with his consent and harry handcock had ceased to speak tenderly he had ceased to speak tenderly though he didn t cease to visit the quiet house in arundel

gloriously for the british arms than advantageously for the british american possessions the inhabitants of the provinces were perhaps never better disposed to the metropolitan state than at the very period of which we are about to write all their early predilections seemed to be gaining strength instead of becoming weaker and as in nature the calm is known to succeed the tempest the blind attachment of the colony to the parent country was but a precursor of the alienation and violent disunion that were so soon to follow although the superiority of the english seamen was well established in the conflicts that took place between the years and that of the naval warfare of the period by no means possessed the very decided character with which it became stamped a quarter of a century later in our own times the british marine appears to have improved in quality as its enemies deteriorated in the year however greek met greek when of a verity came the tug of war the great change that came over the other navies of europe was merely a consequence of the revolutions which drove experienced men into exile and which by rendering armies all important even to the existence of the different states threw nautical enterprises into the shade and gave an engrossing direction to courage and talent in another quarter while france was struggling first for independence and next for

the english marine the gentry of the colonies willingly placed their sons in the royal navy and many a bit of square bunting has been flying at the royal mast heads of king s ships in the nineteenth century as the distinguishing symbols of flag officers who had to look for their birth places among ourselves in the course of a chequered life in which we have been brought in collision with as great a diversity of rank professions and characters as often falls to the lot of any one individual we have been thrown into contact with no less than eight english admirals of american birth while it has never yet been our good fortune to meet with a countryman who has had this rank bestowed on him by his own government on one occasion an englishman who had filled the highest civil office connected with the marine of his nation observed to us that the only man he then knew in the british navy in whom he should feel an entire confidence in entrusting an important command was one of these translated admirals and the thought unavoidably passed through our mind that this favourite commander had done well in adhering to the conventional instead of clinging to his natural allegiance inasmuch as he might have toiled for half a century in the service of his native land and been rewarded with a rank that would merely put him on a level with a colonel in the army how much longer this short sighted policy and grievous injustice are to continue no man can say but it is safe to believe that it is to last until some legislator of influence learns the simple truth that the fancied reluctance of popular constituencies to do right oftener exists in the apprehensions of their representatives than in reality but to our tale england enjoys a wide spread reputation for her fogs but little do they know how much a fog may add to natural scenery who never witnessed its magical effects as it has caused a beautiful landscape to coquette with the eye in playful and capricious changes our opening scene is in one of these much derided fogs though let it always be remembered it was a fog of june and not of november on a high head land of the coast of devonshire stood a little station

more claret i won t go to school chapter ii three or four years passed over and the mind of vivian grey astonishingly developed itself he had long ceased to wear frills had broached the subject of boots three or four times made a sad inroad during the holidays in mr grey s bottle of claret and was reported as having once sworn at the butler the young gentleman began also to hint during every vacation that the fellows at flummery s were somewhat too small for his companionship and first bud of puppyism the former advocate of straight hair now expended a portion of his infant income in the purchase of macassar and began to cultivate his curls mrs grey could not entertain for a moment the idea of her son s associating with children the eldest of whom to adopt his own account was not above eight years old so flummery it was determined he should leave but where to go mr grey was for eton but his lady was one of those women whom nothing in the world can persuade that a public school is anything else but a place where boys are roasted alive and so with tears and taunts and supplications the point of private education was conceded at length it was resolved that the only hope should remain at home a season until some plan should be devised for the cultivation of his promising understanding during this year vivian became a somewhat more constant intruder into the library than heretofore and living so much among books he was insensibly attracted to those silent companions that speak so eloquently how far the character of the parent may influence the character of the child the metaphysician must decide certainly the character of vivian grey underwent at this period of his life a sensible change doubtless constant communion with a mind highly refined severely cultivated and much experienced cannot but produce a beneficial impression even upon a mind formed and upon principles developed how infinitely more powerful must the influence of such communion be upon a youthful heart ardent innocent and unpractised as vivian was not to figure in the microcosm of a public school a place for which from his temper he was almost better fitted than any young genius whom the playing fields of eton or the hills of winton can remember there was some difficulty in fixing upon his future academus mr grey s two axioms were first that no one so young as his son should settle in the metropolis and that vivian must consequently not have a private tutor and secondly that all private schools were quite worthless and therefore there was every probability of vivian not receiving any education whatever at length an exception to axiom second started up in the establishment of mr dallas this gentleman was a clergyman a profound grecian and a poor man he had edited the alcestis and married his laundress lost money by his edition and his fellowship by his match in a few days the hall of mr grey s london mansion was filled with all sorts of portmanteaus trunks and travelling cases directed in a boy s sprawling hand to vivian grey esquire at the reverend everard dallas burnsley vicarage hants god bless you my boy write to your mother soon and remember your journal chapter iii the rumour of the arrival of a new fellow circulated with rapidity through the inmates of burnsley vicarage and about fifty young devils were preparing to quiz the newcomer when the school room door opened and mr dallas accompanied by vivian entered a dandy by jove whispered st leger smith what a knowing set out squeaked johnson secundus mammy sick growled barlow primus this last exclamation was however a scandalous libel for certainly no being ever stood in a pedagogue s presence with more perfect sang froid and with a bolder front than did at this moment vivian grey one principle in mr dallas s system was always to introduce a new comer in school hours he was thus carried immediately in medias res and the curiosity of his co mates being in a great degree satisfied at the time when that curiosity could not personally annoy him the new comer was of course much better prepared to make his way when the absence of the ruler became a signal for some oral communication with the arrival however in the present instance the young savages at burnsley vicarage had caught a tartar and in a very few days vivian grey was decidedly the most popular fellow in the school he was so dashing so devilish good tempered so completely up to everything the magnates of the land were certainly rather jealous of his success but their very sneers bore witness to his popularity cursed puppy whispered st leger smith thinks himself knowing squeaked johnson secundus thinks himself witty growled barlow primus notwithstanding this cabal days rolled on at burnsley vicarage only to witness the increase of vivian s popularity although more deficient than most of his own age in accurate classical attainments he found himself in talents and various acquirements immeasurably their superior and singular is it that at school distinction in such points is ten thousand times more admired by the multitude than the most profound knowledge of greek metres or the most accurate acquaintance with the value of roman coins vivian grey s english verses and vivian grey s english themes were the subject of universal commendation some young lads made copies of these productions to

much doubt whether their be coming invisible is not because of their having fallen and perished by the way and wherefore said media do you mortals undertake the ascent at all why not be content on the plain and even if attainable what would you do upon that lofty clouded summit or how can you hope to breathe that rarefied air unfitted for your human lungs true my lord said babbalanja and bardianna asserts that the plain alone was intended for man who should be content to dwell under the shade of its groves though the roots thereof descend into the darkness of the earth but my lord you well know that there are those in mardi who secretly regard all stories connected with this peak as inventions of the people of maramma they deny that any thing is to be gained by making a pilgrimage thereto and for warranty they appeal to the sayings of the great prophet alma cried mohi but alma is also quoted by others in vindication of the pilgrimages to ofo they declare that the prophet himself was the first pilgrim that thitherward journeyed that from thence he departed to the skies now excepting this same peak maramma is all rolling hill and dale like the sea after a storm which then seems not to roll but to stand still poising its mountains yet the landscape of maramma has not the merriness of meadows partly because of the shadow of ofo and partly because of the solemn groves in which the morais and temples are buried according to mohi not one solitary tree bearing fruit not one esculent root grows in all the isle the population wholly depending upon the large tribute remitted from the neighboring shores it is not that the soil is unproductive said mohi that these things are so it is extremely fertile but the inhabitants say that it would be wrong to make a bread fruit orchard of the holy island and hence my lord said babbalanja while others are charged with the business of their temporal welfare these islanders take no thought of the morrow and broad maramma lies one fertile waste in the lagoon chapter ii they land coming close to the island the pennons and trappings of our canoes were removed and vee vee was commanded to descend from the shark s mouth and for a time to lay aside his conch in token of reverence our paddlers also stripped to the waist an example which even media followed though as a king the same homage he rendered was at times rendered himself at every place hitherto visited joyous crowds stood ready to hail our arrival but the shores of maramma were silent and forlorn said babbalanja it looks not as if the lost one were here at length we landed in a little cove nigh a valley which mohi called uma and here in silence we beached our canoes but presently there came to us an old man with a beard white as the mane of the pale horse he was clad in a midnight robe he fanned himself with a fan of faded leaves a child led him by the hand for he was blind wearing a green plantain leaf over his plaited brow him media accosted making mention who we were and on what errand we came to seek out yillah and behold the isle whereupon pani for such was his name gave us a courteous reception and lavishly promised to discover sweet yillah declaring that in maramma if any where the long lost maiden must be found he assured us that throughout the whole land he would lead us leaving no place desirable to be searched unexplored and so saying he conducted us to his dwelling for refreshment and repose it was large and lofty near by however were many miserable hovels with squalid inmates but the old man s retreat was exceedingly comfortable especially abounding in mats for lounging his rafters were bowed down by calabashes of good cheer during the repast which ensued blind pani freely partaking enlarged upon the merit of abstinence declaring that a thatch overhead and a cocoanut tree comprised all that was necessary for the temporal welfare of a mardian more than this he assured us was sinful he now made known that he officiated as guide in this quarter of the country and that as he had renounced all other pursuits to devote himself to showing strangers the island and more particularly the best way to ascend lofty ofo he was necessitated to seek remuneration for his toil my lord then whispered mohi to media the great prophet alma always declared that without charge this island was free to all what recompense do you desire old man said media to path what i seek is but little twenty rolls of fine tappa two score mats of best upland grass one canoe load of bread fruit and yams ten gourds of wine and forty strings of teeth you are a large company but my requisitions are small very small said mohi you are extortionate good pani said media and what wants an aged mortal like you with all these things i thought superfluities were worthless nay sinful said babbalanja is not this your habitation already more than abundantly supplied with all desirable furnishings asked yoomy i am but a lowly laborer said the old man meekly crossing his arms but does not the lowliest laborer ask and receive his reward and shall i miss mine but i beg charity of none what i ask i demand and in the dread name of great alma who appointed me a guide and to and fro he strode groping as he went marking his blindness whispered babbalanja to media my lord methinks this pani must be a poor guide in his journeys

playthings or tools or materials to work with jonas said he should be very glad to do it for he thought he could buy him some things that would help him very much in his work jonas carried the money into the city the next time he went and bought him a small hone to sharpen his knife a fine toothed saw and a bottle of black varnish with a little brush to put it on with he brought these things home and gave them to georgie s father and he carried them into the house and put them in a drawer that evening when georgie was at supper his father slyly put the things that jonas had bought on his table so that when he went back after supper he found them there he was very much surprised and pleased he examined them all very particularly and was especially glad to have the black varnish for now he could varnish his work and make it look much more handsome the little boxes that he made after this of a bright black outside and lined neatly with paper within were thought by the boys to be elegant he could now earn money faster and as his father insisted on having all his earnings expended for articles for georgie s own use and jonas used to help him about expending it he got at last quite a variety of implements and articles he had some wire and a little pair of pliers for bending it in all shapes and a hammer and little nails he had also a paint box and brushes and paper of various colors for lining boxes and making portfolios and pocket books and he had varnishes red green blue and black all these he kept in his drawers and shelves and made a great many ingenious things with them so georgie was a great friend of both rollo and jonas and they often used to come and see him and play with him and that was the reason that rollo knew his voice so well when he called to him from the landing when rollo was standing on the bridge as described in the beginning of this story two good friends rollo ran along to the end of the bridge clambered down to the water s edge went along the shore among the trees and shrubbery until he came to the seat where georgie was sitting georgie asked him to sit down and stay with him but rollo said he must go directly home and so georgie took his crutches and they began to walk slowly together up the garden walk where have you been rollo said georgie i have been to see my cousin james to ask him to go to the city with us to morrow are you going to the city yes uncle george gave james and i a half a dollar apiece the other day and mother is going to carry us into the city to morrow to buy something with it is jonas going with you yes said rollo he is going to drive we are going in our carryall i wish you would take some money for me then and get jonas to buy me something with it well i will said rollo what shall he buy for you o he may buy any thing he chooses yes but if you do not tell him what to buy he may buy something you have got already o jonas knows every thing i have got as well as i do just then they came up near the house and georgie asked rollo to look up at the golden pippin tree and see how full it was that is my branch said he he pointed to a large branch which came out on one side and which hung down loaded with fruit it would have broken down perhaps if there had not been a crotched pole put under it to prop it up but all the apples on your branch are not golden pippins said rollo there are some on it that are red what beautiful red apples yes said georgie father grafted that for me to make it bear rosy boys i call the red ones my rosy boys grafted said rollo how did he graft it o said georgie i do not know exactly he cut off a little branch from a rosy boy tree and stuck it on somehow and it grew and bears rosy boys still rollo thought this was very curious georgie told him he would give him an apple and that he might have his choice a pippin or a rosy boy rollo hesitated and looked at them first at one and then at another but he could not decide the rosy boys had the brightest and most beautiful color but then the pippins looked so rich and mellow that he could not choose very easily and so georgie laughed and told him he would settle the difficulty by giving him one of each so come here said he rollo and let me lean on you while i knock them down so rollo came and stood near him while georgie leaned on him and with his crutch gave a gentle tap to one of each of his kinds of apples and they fell down upon the soft grass safe and sound illustration they then went into the house and georgie gave rollo his money wrapped up in a small piece of paper and then rollo bidding him good by went out of the little white gate and walked along home the next morning soon after breakfast jonas drove the carryall up to the front door and rollo and his mother walked out to it rollo s mother took the back seat and rollo and jonas sat in front and they drove along they called at the house where james lived and found him waiting for them on the front steps with his half dollar in his hand he ran into the house to tell his mother that the carryall had come and to bid her good morning and then he came out to the gate james said rollo you may sit on the front seat with jonas if you want to james said he should like to very much and so rollo stepped over behind and sat with his mother this was kind and polite for boys all like the front seat when they are riding and rollo therefore did right to offer it to his cousin a lecture on playthings after a short time they came to a smooth and pleasant road with trees and farmhouses on each side and as the horse was

the readability of a story should depend one would say on its intrinsic merit rather than on the site of its adventures no one will think that hampshire is better for such a purpose than cumberland or essex than leicestershire what abstract objection can there then be to the county cork perhaps the most interesting and certainly the most beautiful part of ireland is that which lies down in the extreme south west with fingers stretching far out into the atlantic ocean this consists of the counties cork and kerry or a portion rather of those counties it contains killarney glengarriffe bantry and inchigeela and is watered by the lee the blackwater and the flesk i know not where is to be found a land more rich in all that constitutes the loveliness of scenery within this district but hardly within that portion of it which is most attractive to tourists is situated the house and domain of castle richmond the river blackwater rises in the county kerry and running from west to east through the northern part of the county cork enters the county waterford beyond fermoy in its course it passes near the little town of kanturk and through the town of mallow castle richmond stands close upon its banks within the barony of desmond and in that kanturk region through which the mallow and killarney railway now passes but which some thirteen years since knew nothing of the navvy s spade or even of the engineer s theodolite castle richmond was at this period the abode of sir thomas fitzgerald who resided there ever and always with his wife lady fitzgerald his two daughters mary and emmeline fitzgerald and as often as purposes of education and pleasure suited with his son herbert fitzgerald neither sir thomas nor sir thomas s house had about them any of those interesting picturesque faults which are so generally attributed to irish landlords and irish castles he was not out of elbows nor was he an absentee castle richmond had no appearance of having been thrown out of its own windows it was a good substantial modern family residence built not more than thirty years since by the late baronet with a lawn sloping down to the river with kitchen gardens and walls for fruit with ample stables and a clock over the entrance to the stable yard it stood in a well timbered park duly stocked with deer and with foxes also which are agricultural animals much more valuable in an irish county than deer so that as regards its appearance castle richmond might have been in hampshire or essex and as regards his property sir thomas fitzgerald might have been a leicestershire baronet here at castle richmond lived sir thomas with his wife and daughters and here taking the period of our story as being exactly thirteen years since his son herbert was staying also in those hard winter months his oxford degree having been taken and his english pursuits admitting of a temporary sojourn in ireland but sir thomas fitzgerald was not the great man of that part of the country at least not the greatest man nor was lady fitzgerald by any means the greatest lady as this greatest lady and the greatest man also will with their belongings be among the most prominent of our dramatis person it may be well that i should not even say a word of them all the world must have heard of desmond court it is the largest inhabited residence known in that part of the world where rumours are afloat of how it covers ten acres of ground how in hewing the stones for it a whole mountain was cut away how it should have cost hundreds of thousands of pounds only that the money was never paid by the rapacious wicked bloodthirsty old earl who caused it to be erected and how the cement was thickened with human blood so goes rumour with the more romantic of the celtic tale bearers it is a huge place huge ungainly and uselessly extensive built at a time when at any rate in ireland men considered neither beauty aptitude nor economy it is three stories high and stands round a quadrangle in which there are two entrances opposite to each other nothing can be well uglier than that great paved court in which there is not a spot of anything green except where the damp has produced an unwholesome growth upon the stones nothing can well be more desolate and on the outside of the building matters are not much better there are no gardens close up to the house no flower beds in the nooks and corners no sweet shrubs peeping in at the square windows gardens there are but they are away half a mile off and the great hall door opens out upon a flat bleak park with hardly a scrap around it which courtesy can call a lawn here at this period of ours lived clara countess of desmond widow of patrick once earl of desmond and father of patrick now earl of desmond these desmonds had once been mighty men in their country ruling the people around them as serfs and ruling them with hot iron rods but those days were now long gone and,2

bargain is still advantageous to the foreigner because the commodity which he receives in exchange though it has cost us less would have cost him more as often as a country possesses two commodities one of which it can produce with less labour comparatively to what it would cost in a foreign country than the other so often it is the interest of the country to export the first mentioned commodity and to import the second even though it might be able to produce both the one and the other at a less expense of labour than the foreign country can produce them but not less in the same degree or might be unable to produce either except at a greater expense but not greater in the same degree on the contrary if it produces both commodities with greater facility or both with greater difficulty and greater in exactly the same degree there will be no motive to interchange if the cloth and the corn each of which required days labour in poland required each days labour in england it would follow that the cloth of days labour in england if sent to poland would be equal to the cloth of days labour in poland if exchanged for corn therefore it would exchange for the corn of only days labour but the corn of days labour in poland was supposed to be the same quantity with that of days labour in england with days labour in cloth therefore england would only get as much corn in poland as she could raise with days labour at home and she would in importing it have the cost of carriage besides in these circumstances no exchange would take place if on the other hand while the cloth produced with days labour in poland was produced with days labour in england the corn which was produced in poland with days labour could not be produced in england with less than days labour an adequate motive to exchange would immediately arise with a quantity of cloth which england produced with days labour she would be able to purchase as much corn in poland as was there produced with days labour but the quantity which was there produced with days labour would be as great as the quantity produced in england with days labour the power of poland would be reciprocal with a quantity of corn which cost her days labour equal to the quantity produced in england by days labour she could in the supposed case purchase in england the produce of days labour in cloth but the produce of days labour in england in the article of cloth would be equal to the produce of days labour in poland the remainder of what mr ricardo has done for the philosophical exposition of the principles of foreign trade is to shew that the truth of the propositions now recapitulated is not affected by the introduction of money as a medium of exchange the precious metals always tending to distribute themselves in such a manner throughout the commercial world that every country shall import all that it would have imported and export all that it would have exported if exchanges had taken place as in the example above supposed by barter to this branch of the subject we shall in the sequel of this essay return at present it will be more convenient that we should continue to suppose that exchanges take place by the direct trucking of one commodity against another it is established that the advantage which two countries derive from trading with each other results from the more advantageous employment which thence arises of the labour and capital for shortness let us say the labour of both jointly the circumstances are such that if each country confines itself to the production of one commodity there is a greater total return to the labour of both together and this increase of produce forms the whole of what the two countries taken together gain by the trade it is the purpose of the present essay to inquire in what proportion the increase of produce arising from the saving of labour is divided between the two countries this question was not entered into by mr ricardo whose attention was engrossed by far more important questions and who having a science to create had not time or room to occupy himself with much more than the leading principles when he had done enough to enable any one who came after him and who took the necessary pains to do all the rest he was satisfied he very rarely followed out the principles of the science into the ramifications of their consequences but we believe that to no one who has thoroughly entered into the spirit of his discoveries will even the minutiae of the science offer any difficulty but that which is constituted by the necessity of patience and circumspection in tracing principles to their results mr ricardo while intending to go no further into the question of the advantage of foreign trade than to show what it consisted of and under what circumstances it arose unguardedly expressed himself as if each of the two countries making the exchange separately gained the whole of the difference between the comparative costs of the two commodities in one country and in the other but the whole gain of both countries together consisting in the saving of labour and the saving of labour being exactly equal to the difference between the costs in the two countries of the one commodity as compared with the other the two countries taken together gain no more than this difference and if either country gains the whole of it the other country derives no advantage from the trade suppose for example that yards of broad cloth cost in england as much labour as yards of linen and in germany as much as if england sends yards of broad cloth to germany and is able to exchange them for linen according to the german cost of production sh,2

further that as masters they confer the said authority voluntarily and this implies that they may give or withhold it as they please to call that deputed which is wrenched from men whether they will or not is nonsense but what is here true of all collectively is equally true of each separately as a government can rightly act for the people only when empowered by them so also can it rightly act for the individual only when empowered by him if a b and c debate whether they shall employ an agent to perform for them a certain service and if whilst a and b agree to do so c dissents c cannot equitably be made a party to the agreement in spite of himself and this must be equally true of thirty as of three and if of thirty why not of three hundred or three thousand or three millions of the political superstitions lately alluded to none is so universally diffused as the notion that majorities are omnipotent under the impression that the preservation of order will ever require power to be wielded by some party the moral sense of our time feels that such power cannot rightly be conferred on any but the largest moiety of society it interprets literally the saying that the voice of the people is the voice of god and transferring to the one the sacredness attached to the other it concludes that from the will of the people that is of the majority there can be no appeal yet is this belief entirely erroneous suppose for the sake of argument that struck by some malthusian panic a legislature duly representing public opinion were to enact that all children born during the next ten years should be drowned does any one think such an enactment would be warrantable if not there is evidently a limit to the power of a majority suppose again that of two races living together celts and saxons for example the most numerous determined to make the others their slaves would the authority of the greatest number be in such case valid if not there is something to which its authority must be subordinate suppose once more that all men having incomes under a year were to resolve upon reducing every income above that amount to their own standard and appropriating the excess for public purposes could their resolution be justified if not it must be a third time confessed that there is a law to which the popular voice must defer what then is that law if not the law of pure equity the law of equal freedom these restraints which all would put to the will of the majority are exactly the restraints set up by that law we deny the right of a majority to murder to enslave or to rob simply because murder enslaving and robbery are violations of that law violations too gross to be overlooked but if great violations of it are wrong so also are smaller ones if the will of the many cannot supersede the first principle of morality in these cases neither can it in any so that however insignificant the minority and however trifling the proposed trespass against their rights no such trespass is permissible when we have made our constitution purely democratic thinks to himself the earnest reformer we shall have brought government into harmony with absolute justice such a faith though perhaps needful for the age is a very erroneous one by no process can coercion be made equitable the freest form of government is only the least objectionable form the rule of the many by the few we call tyranny the rule of the few by the many is tyranny also only of a less intense kind you shall do as we will and not as you will is in either case the declaration and if the hundred make it to ninety nine instead of the ninety nine to the hundred it is only a fraction less immoral of two such parties whichever fulfils this declaration necessarily breaks the law of equal freedom the only difference being that by the one it is broken in the persons of ninety nine whilst by the other it is broken in the persons of a hundred and the merit of the democratic form of government consists solely in this that it trespasses against the smallest number the very existence of majorities and minorities is indicative of an immoral state the man whose character harmonises with the moral law we found to be one who can obtain complete happiness without diminishing the happiness of his fellows but the enactment of public arrangements by vote implies a society consisting of men otherwise constituted implies that the desires of some cannot be satisfied without sacrificing the desires of others implies that in the pursuit of their happiness the majority inflict a certain amount of un happiness on the minority implies therefore organic immorality thus from another point of view we again perceive that even in its most equitable form it is impossible for government to dissociate itself from evil and further that unless the right to ignore the state is recognised its acts must be essentially criminal that a man is free to abandon the benefits and throw off the burdens of citizenship may indeed be inferred from the admissions of existing authorities and of current opinion unprepared as they probably are for so extreme a doctrine as the one here maintained the radicals of our day yet unwittingly profess their belief in a maxim which obviously embodies this doctrine do we not continually hear them quote blackstone s assertion that no subject of england can be constrained to pay any aids or taxes even for the defence of the realm or the support of government but such as are imposed by his own consent or that of his representative in parliament and what does this mean it means say they that every man should have a vote true but it means much more if there is any sense in words it is a distinct enunciation of the very right now contended for in aff,2

'andtotake,inyourpresence,theoathprescribedbytheConstitution', 'oftheUnitedStates,tobetaken']",by some action not provided for in the instrument itself again if the united states be not a government proper but an association of states in the nature of contract merely can it as a contract be peaceably unmade by less than all the parties who made it one party to a contract may violate it break it so to speak but does it not require all to lawfully rescind it descending from these general principles we find the proposition that in legal contemplation the union is perpetual confirmed by the history of the union itself the union is much older than the constitution it was formed in fact by the articles of association in it was matured and continued by the declaration of independence in it was further matured and the faith of all the then thirteen states expressly plighted and engaged that it should be perpetual by the articles of confederation in and finally in one of the declared objects for ordaining and establishing the constitution was to form a more perfect union but if the destruction of the union by one or by a part only of the states be lawfully possible the union is less perfect than before the constitution having lost the vital element of perpetuity it follows from these views that no state upon its own mere motion can lawfully get out of the union that resolves and ordinances to that effect are legally void and that acts of violence within any state or states against the authority of the united states are insurrectionary or revolutionary according to circumstances i therefore consider that in view of the constitution and the laws the union is unbroken and to the extent of my ability i shall take care as the constitution itself expressly enjoins upon me that the laws of the union be faithfully executed in all the states doing this i deem to be only a simple duty on my part and i shall perform it so far as practicable unless my rightful masters the american people shall withhold the requisite means or in some authoritative manner direct the contrary i trust this will not be regarded as a menace but only as the declared purpose of the union that it will constitutionally defend and maintain itself in doing this there needs to be no bloodshed or violence and there shall be none unless it be forced upon the national authority the power confided to me will be used to hold occupy and possess the property and places belonging to the government and to collect the duties and imposts but beyond what may be necessary for these objects there will be no invasion no using of force against or among the people anywhere where hostility to the united states in any interior locality shall be so great and universal as to prevent competent resident citizens from holding the federal offices there will be no attempt to force obnoxious strangers among the people for that object while the strict legal right may exist in the government to enforce the exercise of these offices the attempt to do so would be so irritating and so nearly impracticable withal that i deem it better to forego for the time the uses of such offices the mails unless repelled will continue to be furnished in all parts of the union so far as possible the people everywhere shall have that sense of perfect security which is most favorable to calm thought and reflection the course here indicated will be followed unless current events and experience shall show a modification or change to be proper and in every case and exigency my best discretion will be exercised according to circumstances actually existing and with a view and a hope of a peaceful solution of the national troubles and the restoration of fraternal sympathies and affections that there are persons in one section or another who seek to destroy the union at all events and are glad of any pretext to do it i will neither affirm nor deny but if there be such i need address no word to them to those however who really love the union may i not speak before entering upon so grave a matter as the destruction of our national fabric with all its benefits its memories and its hopes would it not be wise to ascertain precisely why we do it will you hazard so desperate a step while there is any possibility that any portion of the ills you fly from have no real existence will you while the certain ills you fly to are greater than all the real ones you fly from will you risk the commission of so fearful a mistake all profess to be content in the union if all constitutional rights can be maintained is it true then that any right plainly written in the constitution has been denied i think not happily the human mind is so constituted that no party can reach to the audacity of doing this think if you can of a single instance in which a plainly written provision of the constitution has ever been denied if by the mere force of numbers a majority should deprive a minority of any clearly written constitutional right it might in a moral point of view justify revolution certainly would if such a right were a vital one but such is not our case all the vital rights of minorities and of individuals are so plainly assured to them by affirmations and negations guaranties and prohibitions in the constitution that controversies never arise concerning them but no organic law can ever be framed with a provision specifically applicable to every question which may occur in practical administration no foresight can anticipate nor any document of reasonable length contain express provisions for all possible questions shall fugitives from labor be surrendered by national or state authority the constitution does not expressly say may congress

talk of mamma s relations in that way lizzie said helen i do not care whose relations they are said elizabeth if people will be disagreeable i must say so mrs staunton used to say replied helen that people always ought to keep up their connexion with their relations whether they like them or not there were some very stupid people relations of mr staunton s near dykelands whom fanny and jane could not endure but she used to ask them to dinner very often and always made a point well if i had any disagreeable relations said elizabeth i would make a point of cutting them i do not see why relations have a right to be disagreeable i do not see how you could said helen for instance would you prevent mamma from ever seeing the major her own brother he cannot be half so well worth seeing since he chose to marry such a horrid wife said elizabeth would you never see horace again if he did such a thing said katherine i am sure i would not give him up would you i could trust horace i think said

the elder sisters get no time to eat if they are attending to them and if the little ones are all together everyone will come and help them the old women in the alms houses will said katherine yes and dora will manage that nicely too the table will not be too high for her to reach and she will be very happy to be able to wait on her little class and they are to have tea and cake instead of dinner

pierre was the only son of an affluent and haughty widow a lady who externally furnished a singular example of the preservative and beautifying influences of unfluctuating rank health and wealth when joined to a fine mind of medium culture uncankered by any inconsolable grief and never worn by sordid cares in mature age the rose still miraculously clung to her cheek litheness had not yet completely uncoiled itself from her waist nor smoothness unscrolled itself from her brow nor diamondness departed from her eyes so that when lit up and bediademed by ball room lights mrs glendinning still eclipsed far younger charms and had she chosen to encourage them would have been followed by a train of infatuated suitors little less young than her own son pierre but a reverential and devoted son seemed lover enough for this widow bloom and besides all this pierre when namelessly annoyed and sometimes even jealously transported by the too ardent admiration of the handsome youths who now and then caught in unintended snares seemed to entertain some insane hopes of wedding this unattainable being pierre had more than once with a playful malice openly sworn that the man gray beard or beardless who should dare to propose marriage to his mother that man would by some peremptory unrevealed agency immediately disappear from the earth this romantic filial love of pierre seemed fully returned by the triumphant maternal pride of the widow who in the clear cut lineaments and noble air of the son saw her own graces strangely translated into the opposite sex there was a striking personal resemblance between them and as the mother seemed to have long stood still in her beauty heedless of the passing years so pierre seemed to meet her half way and by a splendid precocity of form and feature almost advanced himself to that mature stand point in time where his pedestaled mother so long had stood in the playfulness of their unclouded love and with that strange license which a perfect confidence and mutual understanding at all points had long bred between them they were wont to call each other brother and sister both in public and private this was their usage nor when thrown among strangers was this mode of address ever suspected for a sportful assumption since the amaranthiness of mrs glendinning fully sustained this youthful pretension thus freely and lightsomely

choice fate to have been born and nurtured in the country surrounded by scenery whose uncommon loveliness was the perfect mould of a delicate and poetic mind while the popular names of its finest features appealed to the proudest patriotic and family associations of the historic line of glendinning on the meadows which sloped away from the shaded rear of the manorial mansion far to the winding river an indian battle had been fought in the earlier days of the colony and in that battle the paternal great grandfather of pierre mortally wounded had sat unhorsed on his saddle in the grass with his dying voice still cheering his men in the fray this was saddle meadows a name likewise extended to the mansion and the village far beyond these plains a day s walk for pierre rose the storied heights where in the revolutionary war his grandfather had for several months defended a rude but all important stockaded fort against the repeated combined assaults of indians tories and regulars from before that fort the gentlemanly but murderous half breed brandt had fled but had survived to dine with general glendinning in the amicable times which followed that vindictive war all the associations of saddle meadows were full of pride to pierre the glendinning deeds by which their estate had so long been held bore the cyphers of three indian kings the aboriginal and only conveyancers of those noble woods and plains thus loftily in the days of his circumscribed youth did pierre glance along the background of his race little recking of that maturer and larger interior development which should forever deprive these things of their full power of pride in his soul but the breeding of pierre would have been unwisely contracted had his youth been unintermittingly passed in these rural scenes at a very early period he had begun to accompany his father and mother and afterwards his mother alone in their annual visits to the city where naturally mingling in a large and

year there stood upon the borders of epping forest at a distance of about twelve miles from london measuring from the standard in cornhill or rather from the spot on or near to which the standard used to be in days of yore a house of public entertainment called the maypole which fact was demonstrated to all such travellers as could neither read nor write and at that time a vast number both of travellers and stay at homes were in this condition by the emblem reared on the roadside over against the house which if not of those goodly proportions that maypoles were wont to present in olden times was a fair young ash thirty feet in height and straight as any arrow that ever english yeoman drew the maypole by which term from henceforth is meant the house and not its sign the maypole was an old building with more gable ends than a lazy man would care to count on a sunny day huge zig zag chimneys out of which it seemed as though even smoke could not choose but come in more than naturally fantastic shapes imparted to it in its tortuous progress and vast stables gloomy ruinous and empty the place was said to have been built in the days of king henry the eighth and there was a legend not only that queen elizabeth had slept there one night while upon a hunting excursion to wit in a certain oak panelled room with a deep bay window but that next morning while standing on a mounting block before the door with one foot in the stirrup the virgin monarch had then and there boxed and cuffed an unlucky page for some neglect of duty the matter of fact and doubtful folks of whom there were a few among the maypole customers as unluckily there always are in every little community were inclined to look upon this tradition as rather apocryphal but whenever the landlord of that ancient hostelry appealed to the mounting block itself as evidence and triumphantly pointed out that there it stood in the same place to that very day the doubters never failed to be put down by a large majority and all true believers exulted as in a victory whether these and many other stories of the like nature were true or untrue the maypole was really an old house a very old house perhaps as old as it claimed to be and perhaps older which will sometimes happen with houses of an uncertain as with ladies of a certain age its windows were old diamond pane lattices its floors were sunken and uneven its ceilings blackened by the hand of time and heavy with massive beams over the doorway was an ancient porch quaintly and grotesquely carved and here on summer evenings the more favoured customers smoked and drank ay and sang many a good song too sometimes reposing on two grim looking high backed settles which like the twin dragons of some fairy tale guarded the entrance to the mansion in the chimneys of the disused rooms swallows had built their nests for many a long year and from earliest spring to latest autumn whole colonies of sparrows chirped and twittered in the eaves there were more pigeons about the dreary stable yard and out buildings than anybody but the landlord could reckon up the wheeling and circling flights of runts fantails tumblers and pouters were perhaps not quite consistent with the grave and sober character of the building but the monotonous cooing which never ceased to be raised by some among them all day long suited it exactly and seemed to lull it to rest with its overhanging stories drowsy little panes of glass and front bulging out and projecting over the pathway the old house looked as if it were nodding in its sleep indeed it needed no very great stretch of fancy to detect in it other resemblances to humanity the bricks of which it was built had originally been a deep dark red but had grown yellow and discoloured like an old man s skin the sturdy timbers had decayed like teeth and here and there the ivy like a warm garment to comfort it in its age wrapt its green leaves closely round the time worn walls it was a hale and hearty age though still and in the summer or autumn evenings when the glow of the setting sun fell upon the oak and chestnut trees of the adjacent forest the old house partaking of its lustre seemed their fit companion and to have many good years of life in him yet the evening with which we have to do was neither a summer nor an autumn one but the twilight of a day in march when the

prehistoric epoch pre geologic time the views indicated in fact are not only quite consistent with the hypothesis that in the still earlier period referred to the condition of our world was very different but they may be held by some to necessitate that hypothesis the physical philosopher who is accurately acquainted with the velocity of a cannon ball and the precise character of the line which it traverses for a yard of its course is necessitated by what he knows of the laws of nature to conclude that it came from a certain spot whence it was impelled by a certain force and that it has followed a certain trajectory in like manner the student of physical geology who fully believes in the uniformity of the general condition of the earth through geologic time may feel compelled by what he knows of causation and by the general analogy of nature to suppose that our solar system was once a nebulous mass that it gradually condensed that it broke up into that wonderful group of harmoniously rolling balls we call planets and satellites and that then each of these underwent its appointed metamorphosis until at last our own share of the cosmic vapour passed into that condition in which we first meet with definite records of its state and in which it has since with comparatively little change remained the doctrine of uniformity and the doctrine of progression are therefore perfectly consistent perhaps indeed they might be shown to be necessarily connected with one another if however the condition of the world which has obtained throughout geologic time is but the sequel to a vast series of changes which took place in pre geologic time then it seems not unlikely that the duration of this latter is to that of the former as the vast extent of geologic time is to the length of the brief epoch we call the historical period and that even the oldest rocks are records of an epoch almost infinitely remote from that which could have witnessed the first shaping of our globe it is probable that no modern geologist would hesitate to admit the general validity of these reasonings when applied to the physics of his subject whence it is the more remarkable that the moment the question changes from one of physics and chemistry to one of natural history scientific opinions and the popular prejudices which reflect them in a distorted form undergo a sudden metamorphosis geologists and palaeontologists write about the beginning of life and the first created forms of living beings as if they were the most familiar things in the world and even cautious writers seem to be on quite friendly terms with the archetype whereby the creator was guided amidst the crash of falling worlds just as it used to be imagined that the ancient world was physically opposed to the present so it is still widely assumed that the living population of our globe whether animal or vegetable in the older epochs exhibited forms so strikingly contrasted with those which we see around us that there is hardly anything in common between the two it is constantly tacitly assumed that we have before us all the forms of life which have ever existed and though the progress of knowledge yearly and almost monthly drives the defenders of that position from their ground they entrench themselves in the new line of defences as if nothing had happened and proclaim that the new beginning is the real beginning without for an instant denying or endeavouring to soften down the considerable positive differences the negative ones are met by another line of argument which undoubtedly obtain between the ancient and the modern worlds of life we believe they have been vastly overstated and exaggerated and this belief is based upon certain facts whose value does not seem to have been fully appreciated though they have long been more or less completely known the multitudinous kinds of animals and plants both recent and fossil are as is well known arranged by zoologists and botanists in accordance with their natural relations into groups which receive the names of sub kingdoms classes orders families genera and species now it is a most remarkable circumstance that viewed on the great scale living beings have differed so little throughout all geologic time that there is no sub kingdom and no class wholly extinct or without living representatives if we descend to the smaller groups we find that the number of orders of plants is about two hundred and i have it on the best authority that not one of these is exclusively fossil so that there is absolutely not a single extinct ordinal type of vegetable life and it is not until we descend to the next group or the families that we find types which are wholly extinct the number of orders of animals on the other hand may be reckoned at a hundred and twenty or thereabouts and of these eight or nine have no living representatives the proportion of extinct ordinal types of animals to the existing types therefore does not exceed seven per cent a marvellously small proportion when we consider the vastness of geologic time another class of considerations of a different kind it is true but tending in the same direction seems to have been overlooked not only is it true that the general plan of construction of animals and plants has been the same in all recorded time as at present but there are particular kinds of animals and plants which have existed throughout vast epochs sometimes through the whole range of recorded time with very little change by reason of this persistency the typical form of such a kind might be called a persistent type in contradistinction to those types which have appeared for but a short time in the course of the world s history examples of these persistent types are abundant,2

of a long past epoch and as the scene of events more full of interest perhaps than those of a gray feudal castle familiar as it stands in its rusty old age it is therefore only the more difficult to imagine the bright novelty with which it first caught the sunshine hundreds of pilgrims annually visit a house in salem belonging to one branch of the ingersoll family of that place which is stoutly maintained to have been the model for hawthorne s visionary dwelling others have supposed that the now vanished house of the identical philip english whose blood as we have already noticed became mingled with that of the hawthornes supplied the pattern and still a third building known as the curwen mansion has been declared the only genuine establishment notwithstanding persistent popular belief the authenticity of all these must positively be denied although it is possible that isolated reminiscences of all three may have blended with the ideal image in the mind of hawthorne he it will be seen remarks in the preface alluding to himself in the third person that he trusts not to be condemned for laying out a street that infringes upon nobody s private rights and building a house of materials long in use for constructing castles in the air more than this he stated to persons still living that the house of the romance was not copied from any actual edifice but was simply a general reproduction of a style of architecture belonging to colonial days examples of which survived into the period of his youth but have since been radically modified or destroyed here as elsewhere he exercised the liberty of a creative mind to heighten the probability of his pictures without confining himself to a literal description of something he had seen while hawthorne remained at lenox and during the composition of this romance various other literary personages settled or stayed for a time in the vicinity among them herman melville whose intercourse hawthorne greatly enjoyed henry james sr doctor holmes j t headley james russell lowell edwin p whipple frederika bremer and j t fields so that there was no lack of intellectual society in the midst of the beautiful and inspiring mountain scenery of the place in the afternoons nowadays he records shortly before beginning the work this valley in which i dwell seems like a vast basin filled with golden sunshine as with wine and happy in the companionship of his wife and their three children he led a simple refined idyllic life despite the restrictions of a scanty and uncertain income a letter written by mrs hawthorne at this time to a member of her family gives incidentally a glimpse of the scene which may properly find a place here she says i delight to think that you also can look forth as i do now upon a broad valley and a fine amphitheater of hills and are about to watch the stately ceremony of the sunset from your piazza but you have not this lovely lake nor i suppose the delicate purple mist which folds these slumbering mountains in airy veils mr hawthorne has been lying down in the sun shine slightly fleckered with the shadows of a tree and una and julian have been making him look like the mighty pan by covering his chin and breast with long grass blades that looked like a verdant and venerable beard the pleasantness and peace of his surroundings and of his modest home in lenox may be taken into account as harmonizing with the mellow serenity of the romance then produced of the work when it appeared in the early spring of he wrote to horatio bridge these words now published for the first time the house of the seven gables in my opinion is better than the scarlet letter but i should not wonder if i had refined upon the principal character a little too much for popular appreciation nor if the romance of the book should be somewhat at odds with the humble and familiar scenery in which i invest it but i feel that portions of it are as good as anything i can hope to write and the publisher speaks encouragingly of its success from england especially came many warm expressions of praise a fact which mrs hawthorne in a private letter commented on as the fulfillment of a possibility which hawthorne writing in boyhood to his mother had looked forward to he had asked her if she would not like him to become an author and have his books read in england g p l preface when a writer calls his work a romance it need hardly be observed that he wishes to claim a certain latitude both as to its fashion and material which he would not have felt himself entitled to assume had he professed to be writing a novel the latter form of composition is presumed to aim at a very minute fidelity not merely to the possible but to the probable and ordinary course of man s experience the former while as a work of art it must rigidly subject itself to laws and while it sins unpardonably so far as it may swerve aside from the truth of the human heart has fairly a right to present that truth under circumstances to a great extent of the writer s own choosing or creation if he think fit also he may so manage his atmospherical medium as to bring out or mellow the lights and deepen and enrich the shadows of the picture he will be wise no doubt to make a very moderate use of the privileges here stated and especially to mingle the marvelous rather as a slight delicate and evanescent flavor than as any portion of the actual substance of the dish offered to the public he can hardly be said however to commit a literary crime even if he disregard this caution in the

of distaste at best more likely revulsion to the vast majority of the reading public perhaps the nature of the novel itself led him to consider publishing it anonymously although we know he was not averse to controversial subjects in his first book the macdermots of ballycloran which he thought had the best plot of all his novels the principal female character is seduced by a scoundrel and dies giving birth to an illegitimate child certainly nina was well suited for the experiment because of it s different setting and subject matter perhaps further to disguise his authorship trollope wrote nina in a style of prose that reads almost like a translation from a foreign language the experiment did not last long enough to test trollope s hypothesis mr hutton critic for the spectator recognized trollope as the author and so stated in his review trollope did not deny the accusation one cannot discuss nina balatka without addressing the question was trollope himself anti semitic a careful reading of his works does not provide a clear answer jews appear in some of his books and are referred to in others often as disreputable characters or money lenders they are seldom mentioned by his christian characters with respect probably realistically reflecting the sentiments of the classes he wrote about some of his greatest villains in his later novels melmotte in the way we live now and lopez in the prime minister are rumored to be jewish but trollope never unequivocally identifies them as jewish perhaps his christian characters expect them to be jewish because they are foreigners and villains however if one ignores the dialogue of his characters even the descriptive and editorial comments by trollope himself at first seem anti semitic he consistently uses jew as a pejorative adjective instead of jewish his descriptions of the appearance of jewish characters are usually unflattering and stereotypical even anton trendellsohn the hero of nina balatka is described as follows to those who know the outward types of his race there could be no doubt that anton trendellsohn was a very jew among jews he was certainly a handsome man not now very young having reached some year certainly in advance of thirty and his face was full of intellect he was slightly made below the middle height but was well made in every limb with small feet and hands and small ears and a well turned neck he was very dark dark as a man can be and yet show no sign of colour in his blood no white man could be more dark and swarthy than anton trendellsohn his eyes however which were quite black were very bright his jet black hair as it clustered round his ears had in it something of a curl had it been allowed to grow it would almost have hung in ringlets but it was worn very short as though its owner were jealous even of the curl anton trendellsohn was decidedly a handsome man but his eyes were somewhat too close together in his face and the bridge of his aquiline nose was not sharply cut as is mostly the case with such a nose on a christian face the olive oval face was without doubt the face of a jew and the mouth was greedy and the teeth were perfect and bright and the movement of the man s body was the movement of a jew this is not the typical description of the romantic hero of a victorian novel even so trollope s description of anton is less derogatory than his description of ezekiel brehgert a character in a later novel the way we live now he was a fat greasy man good looking in a certain degree about fifty with hair dyed black and beard and moustache dyed a dark purple colour the charm of his face consisted in a pair of very bright black eyes which were however set too near together in his face for the general delight of christians he was stout fat all over rather than corpulent and had that look of command in his face which has become common to master butchers probably by long intercourse with sheep and oxen the case for trollope being anti semitic is harder to support however when one considers the behavior of his jewish characters brehgert whose physical description above is stereotypic is one of the few characters in the way we live now whose actions are completely honorable trollope wrote novels before nina balatka only two of those contain jewish characters the first who plays a minor role in orley farm is soloman aram an attorney a victorian rumpole known for defending the accused at the old bailey his skill is needed to defend lady mason against a charge of perjury much to the distaste of her christian advisors he acts with

parliament in rachel ray this served no purpose in the plot the situation probably was included because legislation to allow jews to serve in parliament had been passed only five years before and the issue was still one of public discussion mr hart s appearance is brief he speaks only one or two lines and the reader is not told enough about him to judge his character trollope describes him thus

is quite difficult to drop the pail in such a manner as to get any water when the vessel is under way i should like to try said marco you can find out whether the water is salt easier than that said forester you can let a twine string down and wet the end that will take up enough for a taste well said marco if i ve got a string long enough so saying he began to feel in his pockets for a string he found a piece of twine which he thought would be long enough but on trial it appeared that it would not reach quite to the water forester then tied it to the end of his cane and allowed marco to take the cane and hold it over the side of the vessel and by this means he succeeded in reaching the water and wetting the end of the string he could after all succeed in wetting only a small part of the string for it was drawn along so rapidly by the motion of the boat that it skipped upon the surface of the water without sinking in at length however after he had got the end a little wetted he drew it up and put it in his mouth how does it taste said forester the question was hardly necessary for the faces which marco made showed sufficiently plain that the water was bitter and salt yes it is salt said he then suddenly casting his eye upon a long dark looking substance which just then came floating by he called out why forester what is that a log said forester the log was round and straight and the ends were square the log glided rapidly by and soon disappeared it is a pine log said forester there are vast forests of pine trees in this state they cut down the trees and then cut the trunks into pieces of moderate length and draw them on the snow to the rivers then in the spring the waters rise and float the logs down this is one of these logs floating down sometimes the river is quite full of them where do they go asked marco oh men stop them all along the river and put them into booms and then fasten them together in rafts how do they fasten them together asked marco they drive a pin into the middle of each log and then extend a rope along fastening it to each pin in this manner the rope holds the logs together and they form a long raft when they catch the logs in booms they afterwards form them into rafts and so float them down the river to the mills where they are to be sawed can men stand upon the rafts said marco yes replied forester very well they make a floor of boards i suppose said marco no replied forester they stand directly upon the logs i should think the logs would sink under them replied marco or at least roll about they sink a little replied forester just about as much as the bulk of the man who stands upon them i don t know what you mean by that exactly said marco why the rule of floating bodies is this rejoined forester when any substance like a cake of ice or a log of wood or a boat is floating upon the water a part of it being above the water and a part under the water if a man steps upon it he makes it sink enough deeper to submerge a part of the wood or ice as large as he is himself if there is just as much of the wood or ice above the water as is equal to the bulk of the man then the man in stepping upon it will sink it just to the water s edge but perhaps one man would be heavier than another man said marco yes replied forester but then he would be larger and so according to the principle he would make more wood sink before the equilibrium was reached what is equilibrium asked marco equilibrium is an equality between two forces replied forester i don t see what two forces there are said marco there is the weight of the man pressing downwards said forester for one and the buoyant power of the water that is its upward pressure for the other the weight of the man remains constantly the same but the upward pressure of the water increases in proportion as the log sinks into it for the deeper the log sinks into the water the more of it is submerged and it is more acted upon and pressed upward by the water now as one of these forces remains constant and the other increases they must at length come to be equal that is in equilibrium and then the log will not sink any farther that s the philosophy of it marco marco did not reply but sat looking at the barren and rocky shores of the river as the boat glided by them presently another log came into view there said forester look at that log and see whether you think that you could float upon it yes said marco i think i could it depends said forester on the question whether the part of it which is out of water is as big as you are i think it is said marco yes added forester i have no doubt that it is only i should roll off said marco true replied forester but the millmen who work about the logs acquire astonishing dexterity in standing upon them if there is only enough of the log above water to equal their bulk so that it has buoyant power enough to float them they will keep it steady with their feet and sail about upon it very safely i should like to try said marco perhaps we shall have an opportunity at some place on the river said forester here marco suddenly interrupted the conversation by pointing up the river to a column of smoke and steam which he saw rising beyond a point of land which was just before them here comes another steamboat said he see forester no said forester i believe that is a steam mill a steam mill repeated marco yes replied forester they have steam mills and tide mills to saw up the logs in this part of the river farther up where there are waterfalls on the r,2

spent all the rest of her life at hartfield emma smiled and chatted as cheerfully as she could to keep him from such thoughts but when tea came it was impossible for him not to say exactly as he had said at dinner poor miss taylor i wish she were here again what a pity it is that mr weston ever thought of her i cannot agree with you papa you know i cannot mr weston is such a good humoured pleasant excellent man that he thoroughly deserves a good wife and you would not have had miss taylor live with us for ever and bear all my odd humours when she might have a house of her own a house of her own but where is the advantage of a house of her own this is three times as large and you have never any odd humours my dear how often we shall be going to see them and they coming to see us we shall be always meeting we must begin we must go and pay wedding visit very soon my dear how am i to get so far randalls is such a distance i could not walk half so far no papa nobody thought of your walking we must go in the carriage to be sure the carriage but james will not like to put the horses to for such a little way and where are the poor horses to be while we are paying our visit they are to be put into mr weston s stable papa you know we have settled all that already we talked it all over with mr weston last night and as for james you may be very sure he will always like going to randalls because of his daughter s being housemaid there i only doubt whether he will ever take us anywhere else that was your doing papa you got hannah that good place nobody thought of hannah till you mentioned her james is so obliged to you i am very glad i did think of her it was very lucky for i would not have had poor james think himself slighted upon any account and i am sure she will make a very good servant she is a civil pretty spoken girl i have a great opinion of her whenever i see her she always curtseys and asks me how i do in a very pretty manner and when you have had her here to do needlework i observe she always turns the lock of the door the right way and never bangs it i am sure she will be an excellent servant and it will be a great comfort to poor miss taylor to have somebody about her that she is used to see whenever james goes over to see his daughter you know she will be hearing of us he will be able to tell her how we all are emma spared no exertions to maintain this happier flow of ideas and hoped by the help of backgammon to get her father tolerably through the evening and be attacked by no regrets but her own the backgammon table was placed but a visitor immediately afterwards walked in and made it unnecessary mr knightley a sensible man about seven or eight and thirty was not only a very old and intimate friend of the family but particularly connected with it as the elder brother of isabella s husband he lived about a mile from highbury was a frequent visitor and always welcome and at this time more welcome than usual as coming directly from their mutual connexions in london he had returned to a late dinner after some days absence and now walked up to hartfield to say that all were well in brunswick square it was a happy circumstance and animated mr woodhouse for some time mr knightley had a cheerful manner which always did him good and his many inquiries after poor isabella and her children were answered most satisfactorily when this was over mr woodhouse gratefully observed it is very kind of you mr knightley to come out at this late hour to call upon us i am afraid you must have had a shocking walk not at all sir it is a beautiful moonlight night and so mild that i must draw back from your great fire but you must have found it very damp and dirty i wish you may not catch cold dirty sir look at my shoes not a speck on them well that is quite surprising for we have had a vast deal of rain here it rained dreadfully hard for half an hour while we were at breakfast i wanted them to put off the wedding by the bye i have not wished you joy being pretty well aware of what sort of joy you must both be feeling i have been in no hurry with my congratulations but i hope it all went off tolerably well how did you all behave who cried most ah poor miss taylor tis a sad business poor mr and miss woodhouse if you please but i cannot possibly say poor miss taylor i have a great regard for you and emma but when it comes to the question of dependence or independence at any rate it must be better to have only one to please than two especially when one of those two is such a fanciful troublesome creature said emma playfully that is what you have in your head i know and what you would certainly say if my father were not by i believe it is very true my dear indeed said mr woodhouse with a sigh i am afraid i am sometimes very fanciful and troublesome my dearest papa you do not think i could mean you or suppose mr knightley to mean you what a horrible idea oh no i meant only myself mr knightley loves to find fault with me you know in a joke it is all a joke we always say what we like to one another mr knightley in fact was one of the few people who could see faults in emma woodhouse and the only one who ever told her of them and though this was not particularly agreeable to emma herself she knew it would be so much less so to her father that she would not have him really suspect such a circumstance as her not being thought perfect by every body emma knows i never flatter her said mr knightley but i meant no reflection on any body miss taylor has been used to have two persons to please she will

the tribes that inhabit greenland and kamtschatka can not preserve their accustomed health and vigor on any other than animal food if put upon a diet of vegetables they soon begin to pine away the reverse is true of the vegetable eaters of the tropics they preserve their health and strength well on a diet of rice or bread fruit or bananas and would undoubtedly be made sick by being fed on the flesh of walruses seals and white bears in the temperate regions the productions of the above mentioned extremes are mingled here many animals whose flesh is fit for human food live and thrive and here grows too a vast variety of nutritious fruits and roots and seeds the physical constitution of the various races of men that inhabit these regions is modified accordingly in the temperate climes men can live on vegetable food or on animal food or on both the constitution differs too in different individuals and it changes at different periods of the year some persons require more of animal and others more of vegetable food to preserve their bodily and mental powers in the best condition and each one observes a change in himself in passing from winter to summer in the summer the desire for a diet of fruits and vegetables seems to come northward with the sun and in the winter the appetite for flesh comes southward from the arctic regions with the cold when we consider the different conditions in which the different regions of the earth are placed in respect to their capacity of production for animal and vegetable food we shall see that this adjustment of the constitution of man both to the differences of climate and to the changes of the seasons is a very wise and beneficent arrangement of divine providence to confine man absolutely either to animal or vegetable food would be to depopulate a large part of the earth it results from these general facts in respect to the distribution of the supplies of animal and vegetable food for man in different latitudes that in all northern climes in our hemisphere men living in a savage state must be hunters while those that live near the equator must depend for their subsistence on fruits and roots growing wild when moreover any tribe or race of men in either of these localities take the first steps toward civilization they begin in the one case by taming animals and rearing them in flocks and herds and in the other case by saving the seeds of food producing plants and cultivating them by artificial tillage in inclosed and private fields this last is the condition of all the half civilized tribes of the tropical regions of the earth whereas the former prevails in all the northern temperate and arctic regions as far to the northward as domesticated animals can live from time immemorial the whole interior of the continent of asia has been inhabited by tribes and nations that have taken this one step in the advance toward civilization but have gone no farther they live not like the indians in north america by hunting wild beasts but by rearing and pasturing flocks and herds of animals that they have tamed these animals feed of course on grass and herbage and as grass and herbage can only grow on open ground the forests have gradually disappeared and the country has for ages consisted of great grassy plains or of smooth hill sides covered with verdure over these plains or along the river valleys wander the different tribes of which these pastoral nations are composed living in tents or in frail huts almost equally movable and driving their flocks and herds before them from one pasture ground to another according as the condition of the grass or that of the springs and streams of water may require we obtain a pretty distinct idea of the nature of this pastoral life and of the manners and customs and the domestic constitution to which it gives rise in the accounts given us in the old testament of abraham and lot and of their wanderings with their flocks and herds over the country lying between the euphrates and the mediterranean sea they lived in tents in order that they might remove their habitations the more easily from place to place in following their flocks and herds to different pasture grounds their wealth consisted almost wholly in these flocks and herds the land being almost every where common sometimes when two parties traveling together came to a fertile and well watered district their herdsmen and followers were disposed to contend for the privilege of feeding their flocks upon it and the contention would often lead to a quarrel and combat if it had not been settled by an amicable agreement on the part of the chieftains illustration encampment of a patriarch the father of a family was the legislator and ruler of it and his sons with their wives and his son s sons remained with him sometimes for many years sharing his means of subsistence submitting to his authority and going with him from place to place with all his flocks and herds they employed too so many herdsmen and other servants and followers as to form in many cases quite an extended community and sometimes in case of hostilities with any other wandering tribe a single patriarch could send forth from his own domestic circle a force of several hundred armed men such a company as this when moving across the country on its way from one region of pasturage to another appeared like an immense caravan on its march and when settled at an encampment the tents formed quite a little town whenever the head of one of these wandering families died the tendency was not for the members of the community to separate but to keep together and allow the oldest son to take the father s place as chieftain and ruler this was necessary for defense as of course such communities as these were in perpetual danger of coming into collision with othe,3

doctrines it is only fair you should have all the old jokes too smith laughing also by the way you call it a conjuring trick that poor people should drink moderately doctor i call it a chemical discovery that alcohol is not a food smith you don t drink wine yourself doctor mildly startled drink wine well what else is there to drink smith so drinking decently is a conjuring trick that you can do anyhow doctor still good humouredly well well let us hope so talking about conjuring tricks there is to be conjuring and all kinds of things here this afternoon smith conjuring indeed why is that enter hastings with a letter in each hand hastings his grace will be with you presently he asked me to deal with the business matter first of all he gives a note to each of them smith turning eagerly to the doctor but this is rather splendid the duke s given to the new public house hastings the duke is very liberal collects papers doctor examining his cheque very but this is rather curious he has also given to the league for opposing the new public house hastings the duke is very liberal minded exit smith staring at his cheque liberal minded absent minded i should call it doctor sitting down

pretty well smith quietly i suppose you mean you knew something odd about the family doctor well they saw fairies and things of that sort smith and i suppose to the medical mind seeing fairies means much the same as seeing snakes doctor with a sour smile well they saw them in ireland i suppose it s quite correct to see fairies in ireland it s like gambling at monte carlo it s quite respectable but i do draw the line at their seeing fairies in england i do object to their bringing their ghosts and goblins and witches into the poor duke s own back garden and within a yard of my own red lamp it shows a lack of tact smith but i do understand that the duke s nephew and niece see witches and fairies between here and your lamp he walks to the garden window and looks out doctor well the nephew has been in america it stands to reason you can t see fairies in america but there is this sort of superstition in the family and i am not easy in my mind about the girl smith why what does she do doctor oh she wanders about the park and the woods in the evenings damp evenings for choice she calls it the celtic twilight i ve no use for the celtic twilight myself it has a tendency to get on the chest but what is worse she is always talking about meeting somebody some elf or wizard or something i don t like it at all smith have you told the duke doctor with a grim smile oh yes i told the duke the result was the conjurer smith with amazement the conjurer doctor puts down his cigar in the ash tray the duke is indescribable he will be here presently and you shall judge for yourself put two or

practical brother from america and he would settle it in some obvious way and satisfy some one send her to america or let her have her fairies in ireland now the duke thinks a conjurer would just meet the case i suppose he vaguely thinks it would brighten things up and somehow satisfy the believers interest in supernatural things and the unbelievers interest in smart things as a matter of fact the

to say and i don t particularly care i only know it was something military i also remember that the costume was two sizes too small for me in the chest and thereabouts and three sizes too large for me in the hat i padded the hat and dined in the middle of the day off a chop and half a glass of soda water i have gained prizes as a boy for mathematics also for scripture history not often but i have done it a literary critic now dead once praised a book of mine i know there have been occasions when my conduct has won the approbation of good men but never never in my whole life have i felt more proud more satisfied with myself than on that evening when the last hook fastened i gazed at my full length self in the cheval glass i was a dream i say it who should not but i am not the only one who said it i was a glittering dream the groundwork was red trimmed with gold braid wherever there was room for gold braid and where there was no more possible room for gold braid there hung gold cords and tassels and straps gold buttons and buckles fastened me gold embroidered belts and sashes caressed me white horse hair plumes waved o er me i am not sure that everything was in its proper place but i managed to get everything on somehow and i looked well it suited me my success was a revelation to me of female human nature girls who had hitherto been cold and distant gathered round me timidly solicitous of notice girls on whom i smiled lost their heads and gave themselves airs girls who were not introduced to me sulked and were rude to girls that had been for one poor child with whom i sat out two dances at least she sat while i stood gracefully beside her i had been advised by the costumier not to sit i was sorry he was a worthy young fellow the son of a cotton broker and he would have made her a good husband i feel sure but he was foolish to come as a beer bottle perhaps after all it is as well those old fashions have gone out a week in that suit might have impaired my natural modesty one wonders that fancy dress balls are not more popular in this grey age of ours the childish instinct to dress up to make believe is with us all we grow so tired of being always ourselves a tea table discussion at which i once assisted fell into this would any one of us when it came to the point change with anybody else the poor man with the millionaire the governess with the princess change not only outward circumstances and surroundings but health and temperament heart brain and soul so that not one mental or physical particle of one s original self one would retain save only memory the general opinion was that we would not but one lady maintained the affirmative oh no you wouldn t really dear argued a friend you think you would yes i would persisted the first lady i am tired of myself i d even be you for a change in my youth the question chiefly important to me was what sort of man shall i decide to be at nineteen one asks oneself this question at thirty nine we say i wish fate hadn t made me this sort of man in those days i was a reader of much well meant advice to young men and i gathered that whether i should become a sir lancelot a herr teufelsdrockh or an iago was a matter for my own individual choice whether i should go through life gaily or gravely was a question the pros and cons of which i carefully considered for patterns i turned to books byron was then still popular and many of us made up our minds to be gloomy saturnine young men weary with the world and prone to soliloquy i determined to join them for a month i rarely smiled or when i did it was with a weary bitter smile concealing a broken heart at least that was the intention shallow minded observers misunderstood i know exactly how it feels they would say looking at me sympathetically i often have it myself it s the sudden change in the weather i think and they would press neat brandy upon me and suggest ginger again it is distressing to the young man busy burying his secret sorrow under a mound of silence to be slapped on the back by commonplace people and asked well how s the hump this morning and to hear his mood of dignified melancholy referred to by those who should know better as the sulks there are practical difficulties also in the way of him who would play the byronic young gentleman he must be supernaturally wicked or rather must have been only alas in the unliterary grammar of life where the future tense stands first and the past is formed not from the indefinite but from the present indicative to have been is to be and to be wicked on a small income is impossible the ruin of even the simplest of maidens costs money in the courts of love one cannot sue in forma pauperis nor would it be the byronic method to drown remembrance in the cup sounds well but then the cup to be fitting should be of some expensive brand to drink deep of old tokay or asti is poetical but when one s purse necessitates that the draught if it is to be deep

people will think that the hundred pages of the italian tour vol ii and some other not very remarkable impressions of travel might as well or better have been left out as a mere letter writer george eliot will not rank among the famous masters of what is usually considered especially a woman s art she was too busy in serious work to have leisure for that most delightful way of wasting time besides that she had by nature none of that fluency rapidity abandonment pleasant volubility which make letters amusing captivating or piquant what mr cross says of her as the mistress of a salon is true of her for the most part as a correspondent playing around many disconnected subjects in talk neither interested nor amused her much she took things too seriously and seldom found the effort of entertaining compensated by the gain iii there is the outpouring of ardent feeling for her friends sobering down as life goes on into a crooning kindliness affectionate and honest but often tinged with considerable self consciousness it was said of some one that his epigrams did honour to his heart in the reverse direction we occasionally feel that george eliot s effusive playfulness does honour to her head it lacks simplicity and verve even in an invitation to dinner the words imply a grave sense of responsibility on both sides and sense of responsibility is fatal to the charm of familiar correspondence as was inevitable in one whose mind was so habitually turned to the deeper elements of life she lets fall the pearls of wise speech even in short notes here are one or two my own experience and development deepen every day my conviction that our moral progress may be measured by the degree in which we sympathise with individual suffering and individual joy if there is one attitude more odious to me than any other of the many attitudes of knowingness it is that air of lofty superiority to the vulgar she will soon find out that i am a very commonplace woman it so often happens that others are measuring us by our past self while we are looking back on that self with a mixture of disgust and sorrow the following is one of the best examples one of the few examples of her best manner i have been made rather unhappy by my husband s impulsive proposal about christmas we are dull old persons and your two sweet young ones ought to find each christmas a new bright bead to string on their memory whereas to spend the time with us would be to string on a dark shrivelled berry they ought to have a group of young creatures to be joyful with our own children always spend their christmas with gertrude s family and we have usually taken our sober merry making with friends out of town illness among these will break our custom this year and thus mein mann feeling that our christmas was free considered how very much he liked being with you omitting the other side of the question namely our total lack of means to make a suitably joyous meeting a real festival for phil and margaret i was conscious of this lack in the very moment of the proposal and the consciousness has been pressing on me more and more painfully ever since even my husband s affectionate hopefulness cannot withstand my melancholy demonstration so pray consider the kill joy proposition as entirely retracted and give us something of yourselves only on simple black letter days when the herald angels have not been raising expectations early in the morning this is very pleasant but such pieces are rare and the infirmity of human nature has sometimes made us sigh over these pages at the recollection of the cordial cheeriness of scott s letters the high spirits of macaulay the graceful levity of voltaire the rattling dare devilry of byron epistolary stilts among men of letters went out of fashion with pope who as was said thought that unless every period finished with a conceit the letter was not worth the postage poor spirits cannot be the explanation of the stiffness in george eliot s case for no letters in the english language are so full of playfulness and charm as those of cowper and he was habitually sunk in gulfs deeper and blacker than george eliot s own it was sometimes observed of her that in her conversation elle s coutait quand elle parlait she seemed to be listening to her own voice while she spoke it must be allowed that we are not always free from an impression of self listening even in the most caressing of the letters before us this is not much better however than trifling i daresay that if a lively frenchman could have watched the inspired pythia on the sublime tripod he would have cried elle s coute quand elle parle when everything of that kind has been said we have the profound satisfaction which is not quite a matter of course in the history of literature of finding after all that the woman and the writer were one the life does not belie the books nor private conduct stultify public profession we close the third volume of the biography as we have so often closed the third volume of her novels feeling to the very core that in spite of a style that the french call alambiqu in spite of tiresome double and treble distillations of phraseology in spite of fatiguing moralities gravities and ponderosities we have still been in communion with a high and commanding intellect and a great nature we are vexed by pedantries that recall the pr cieuses of the h tel rambouillet but we know that she had the soul of the most heroic women in history we crave more of the olympian serenity that makes action natural and repose refreshing but we cannot miss the

and incomprehensible principle of human nature under the influence of which vast masses of men notwithstanding the universal instinct of aversion to control combine under certain circumstances by millions and millions to maintain for many successive centuries the representatives of some one great family in a condition of exalted and absolute and utterly irresponsible ascendency over themselves while they toil for them watch over them submit to endless and most humiliating privations in their behalf and commit if commanded to do so the most inexcusable and atrocious crimes to sustain the demigods they have thus made in their lofty estate we have in the case of this persian monarchy one of the most extraordinary exhibitions the persian monarchy appears in fact even as we look back upon it from this remote distance both of space and of time as a very vast wave of human power and grandeur it swelled up among the populations of asia between the persian gulf and the caspian sea about five hundred years before christ and rolled on in undiminished magnitude and glory for many centuries it bore upon its crest the royal line of astyages and his successors cyrus was however the first of the princes whom it held up conspicuously to the admiration of the world and he rode so gracefully and gallantly on the lofty crest that mankind have given him the credit of raising and sustaining the magnificent billow on which he was borne how far we are to consider him as founding the monarchy or the monarchy as raising and illustrating him will appear more fully in the course of this narrative cotemporaneous with this persian monarchy in the east there flourished in the west the small but very efficient and vigorous republics of greece the greeks had a written character for their language which could be easily and rapidly executed while the ordinary language of the persians was scarcely written at all there was it is true in this latter nation a certain learned character which was used by the priests for their mystic records and also for certain sacred books which constituted the only national archives it was however only slowly and with difficulty that this character could be penned and when penned it was unintelligible to the great mass of the population for this reason among others the greeks wrote narratives of the great events which occurred in their day which narratives they so embellished and adorned by the picturesque lights and shades in which their genius enabled them to present the scenes and characters described as to make them universally admired while the surrounding nations produced nothing but formal governmental records not worth to the community at large the toil and labor necessary to decipher them and make them intelligible thus the greek writers became the historians not only of their own republics but also of all the nations around them and with such admirable genius and power did they fulfill this function that while the records of all other nations cotemporary with them have been almost entirely neglected and forgotten the language of the greeks has been preserved among mankind with infinite labor and toil by successive generations of scholars in every civilized nation for two thousand years solely in order that men may continue to read these tales two greek historians have given us a narrative of the events connected with the life of cyrus herodotus and xenophon these writers disagree very materially in the statements which they make and modern readers are divided in opinion on the question which to believe in order to present this question fairly to the minds of our readers we must commence this volume with some account of these two authorities whose guidance conflicting as it is furnishes all the light which we have to follow herodotus was a philosopher and scholar xenophon was a great general the one spent his life in solitary study or in visiting various countries in the pursuit of knowledge the other distinguished himself in the command of armies and in distant military expeditions which he conducted with great energy and skill they were both by birth men of wealth and high station so that they occupied from the beginning conspicuous positions in society and as they were both energetic and enterprising in character they were led each to a very romantic and adventurous career the one in his travels the other in his campaigns so that their personal history and their exploits attracted great attention even while they lived herodotus was born in the year before christ which was about fifty years after the death of the cyrus whose history forms the subject of this volume he was born in the grecian state of caria in asia minor and in the city of halicarnassus caria as may be seen from the map at the commencement of this volume was in the southwestern part of asia minor near the shores of the x gean sea herodotus became a student at a very early age it was the custom in greece at that time to give to young men of his rank a good intellectual education in other nations the training of the young men in wealthy and powerful families was confined almost exclusively to the use of arms to horsemanship to athletic feats and other such accomplishments as would give them a manly and graceful personal bearing and enable them to excel in the various friendly contests of the public games as well as prepare them to maintain their ground against their enemies in personal combats on the field of battle the greeks without neglecting these things taught their young men also to read and to write explained to them the structure and the philosophy of language and trained them to the study of the poets the orators and the historians which their country had produced,3

may complain of misinterpretation if the greater part of miss taylor s article with which i entirely sympathise is supposed to be applicable to my intolerance let us have full toleration by all means upon all questions in which there is room for doubt or which cannot be distinctly proved to affect the welfare of mankind but when miss taylor has shown what basis exists for criminal legislation except the clear right of mankind not to tolerate that which is demonstrably contrary to the welfare of society i will admit that such demonstration ought only to be believed in by the curates and old women to whom she refers recent events have not weakened the conviction i expressed in a much abused speech at the london school board that ultramontanism is demonstrably the enemy of society and must be met with resistance merely passive if possible but active if necessary by the whole power of the state next in order it seems proper that i should briefly refer to my friend mr mivart s onslaught upon my criticism of mr darwin s critics himself among the number which will be found in this volume in evolution and its consequences i am accused of misrepresentation misquotation misunderstanding and numerous other negative and positive literary and scientific sins and much subtle ingenuity is expended by mr mivart in attempting to extricate himself from the position in which my exposition of the real opinions of father suarez has placed him so much more in fact has mr mivart s ingenuity impressed me than any other feature of his reply that i shall take the liberty of re stating the main issue between us and for the present leaving that issue alone to the judgment of the public footnote contemporary review january in his book on the genesis of species mr mivart after discussing the opinions of sundry catholic writers of authority among whom he especially includes st augustin st thomas aquinas and the jesuit suarez proceeds to say it is then evident that ancient and most venerable theological authorities distinctly assert derivative creation and thus their teachings harmonize with all that modern science can possibly require by the derivative creation of organic forms mr mivart understands that god created them by conferring on the material world the power to evolve them under suitable conditions footnote bunsen s outlines of the philosophy of universal history vol i p on the contrary i proved by evidence which mr mivart does not venture to impugn that suarez in his tractatus de opere sex dierum expressly rejects st augustin s and st thomas views that he vehemently advocates the literal interpretation of the account of the creation given in the book of genesis and that he treats with utter scorn the notion that the almighty could have used the language of that book unless he meant it to be taken literally mr mivart therefore either has read suarez and has totally misrepresented him a hypothesis which i hope i need hardly say i do not for a moment entertain or he has got his information at second hand and has himself been deceived but in that case it is surely an imprudence on his part to reproach me with having read suarez ad hoc and evidently without the guidance of anyone familiar with that author no doubt in the matter of guidance mr mivart has the advantage of me nevertheless the guides who supplied him with his references to suarez metaphysica while they left him in ignorance of the existence of the tractatus are guides with whose services it might be better to dispense leaders who wilfully shut their eyes being even more liable to lodge one in a ditch than blind leaders at the time when the essay on methods and results of ethnology was written i had not met with a passage in professor max m ller s last results of turanian researches which shows so appositely that the profoundest study of philology leads to conclusions respecting the relation of ethnology with philology similar to those at which i had arrived in approaching the question from the anatomist s side that i cannot refrain from quoting it footnote london april nor should we in our phonological studies either expect or desire more than general hints from physical ethnology the proper and rational connection between the two sciences is that of mutual advice and suggestion but nothing more much of the confusion of terms and indistinctness of principles both in ethnology and phonology are due to the combined study of these heterogeneous sciences ethnological race and phonological race are not commensurate except in ante historical times or perhaps at the very dawn of history with the migration of tribes their wars their colonies their conquests and alliances which if we may judge from their effects must have been much more violent in the ethnic than even in the political period of history it is impossible to imagine that race and language should continue to run parallel the physiologist should pursue his own science unconcerned about language it is further desirable to remark that the statements in this essay respecting the forms of native american crania need rectification on this point i refer the reader who is interested in the subject to my paper on the form of the cranium among the patagonians and the fuegians published in the journal of anatomy and physiology for if the problem discussed in my address to the british association in has not yet received its solution it is not because the champions of abiogenesis have been idle or wanting in confidence but every new assertion on their side has been met by a

escaped we don t want to see any more of baxter sam had said but this wish was not to be gratified floating down the mississippi the houseboat got damaged in a big storm and had to be laid up for repairs this being so all on board decided to take a trip inland and accordingly they set out the ladies and girls by way of the railroad and the boys on horseback as already told in the rover boys on the plains this trip was full of mystery and peril dan baxter turned up most unexpectedly and our friends visited a mysterious ranch only to learn that it was a rendezvous for a band of counterfeiters through a government detective the counterfeiters were rounded up only one man sack todd escaping dan baxter also got away but later on he was traced to a big swamp where his horse was found stuck fast in the slimy ooze it was thought by some that baxter had lost his life trying to find his way through the swamp but of this the rovers were somewhat doubtful after the capture of the counterfeiters the boys and their chums had gone on to meet the ladies and the girls and had spent a full week at the ranch of a friend having the best times possible horseback riding hunting and helping to round up cattle then the whole party had gone back to the mississippi embarked on the dora as the houseboat was named and floated down the mighty stream once more this sort of thing is simply grand fred garrison had remarked as he stood on the forward deck of the craft yet an hour later he had changed his tune the houseboat had gone whirling in a bend of the stream struck a snag and hurled poor fred overboard he was hauled up by sam and dick rover and then it was ascertained that the houseboat was leaking and would have to be laid up again for repairs they had stopped at the town of shapette a small place and there they found a carpenter who promised to do what they wanted when the houseboat was laid up the captain had come to them with a letter my brother in cairo is dead said captain starr i shall have to leave you and look after his children the captain was an eccentric individual and the rovers did not like him much so they were perfectly willing to let him go they decided to look around for somebody else to manage the houseboat and in the meantime run the craft themselves with the party as cook and general housekeeper was alexander pop a colored man who had once been a waiter at putnam hall but who was now attached to the rover household the boys had expected to leave aleck as he was called in charge of the dora while they visited a nearby sugar plantation but the colored man had begged to be taken along jes fo de change as he expressed it as aleck had remained on the houseboat during the entire time the boys were on the plains dick agreed to take him along and thus for the time being the dora had been left in the sole care of the planter after the visit to the sugar plantation the party had ridden to shapette to do a little shopping before returning to the houseboat there tom and sam had left the others to make certain that the dora was in proper trim to continue the trip down the mississippi on the way sam stopped at a plantation house to get a drink of water and when he rejoined his brother it was to learn the dismaying news that the houseboat and the man left in charge of the craft had mysteriously disappeared chapter ii about a missing houseboat let us go down the river and see if the dora is behind yonder trees suggested sam after he had had time to digest what his brother had said all right if you say so answered tom but i feel it in my bones it won t do any good the two brothers ran along the wet and slippery bank of the river which at this point sprawled out into almost a lake they had to walk around several wet places and were pretty well out of wind by the time they gained the patch of wood the youngest rover had pointed out they ran to a point where they could get a cle,3

handsome man of pronounced western sort he wore a long gray frock coat without vest and a dark blue stiffly starched shirt over which a red necktie fluttered his carriage was erect his hands large of motion and his profile very fine in its bold lines his eyes were gray and in expression cold and penetrating his nose was broad and the corners of his mouth bitter he could not be called young and yet

companion said be careful mart haney silenced him with a look you re on the outside here partner i didn t mean to butt in i understand but this is a matter between that little girl and me replied the big man in a tone that while friendly ended all further remark on the part of his companion who rose after a little pause and walked away haney remained seated buried in thought amazed at the fever

this child this boyish school girl in a savage selfish and unrestrained way he loved her and had determined to possess her to buy her if necessary he knew something of the toil through which the weary mother plodded and he watched her bend and fade with a certainty that she would one day be on his side when at home and afar from her he felt capable of seizing the girl of carrying her back with him as the old time savage won his bride but when he looked into her clear calm eyes his villiany his resolution fell away from him he found himself not merely a man of the nearer time but a catholic in training at least and the words he had planned to utter fell dead on his lips libertine though he was there were lines over which even his lawlessness could not break he was a desperate character a man of violence and none too delicate in his life among women but away back in his boyhood his good irish mother had taught him to fight fair and to protect the younger and weaker children and this

extremely at the time of their meeting by occupying till the last possible moment a part of the road which she wanted herself on reaching sixty first street she found her way blocked by a lumbering

'THEPOLITICALECONOMYOFART7']",of the most notable appears to me to be the just and wholesome contempt in which we hold poverty i repeat the just and wholesome contempt though i see that some of my hearers look surprised at the expression i assure them i use it in sincerity and i should not have ventured to ask you to listen to me this evening unless i had entertained a profound respect for wealth true wealth that is to say for of course we ought to respect neither wealth nor anything else that is false of its kind and the distinction between real and false wealth is one of the points on which i shall have a few words presently to say to you but true wealth i hold as i said in great honour and sympathize for the most part with that extraordinary feeling of the present age which publicly pays this honour to riches i cannot however help noticing how extraordinary it is and how this epoch of ours differs from all bygone epochs in having no philosophical nor religious worshippers of the ragged godship of poverty in the classical ages not only there were people who voluntarily lived in tubs and who used gravely to maintain the superiority of tub life to town life but the greeks and latins seem to have looked on these eccentric and i do not scruple to say absurd people with as much respect as we do upon large capitalists and landed proprietors so that really in those days no one could be described as purse proud but only as empty purse proud and no less distinct than the honour which those curious greek people pay to their conceited poor is the disrespectful manner in which they speak of the rich so that one cannot listen long either to them or to the roman writers who imitated them without finding oneself entangled in all sorts of plausible absurdities hard upon being convinced of the uselessness of collecting that heavy yellow substance which we call gold and led generally to doubt all the most established maxims of political economy nor are matters much better in the middle ages for the greeks and romans contented themselves with mocking at rich people and constructing merry dialogues between charon and diogenes or menippus in which the ferryman and the cynic rejoiced together as they saw kings and rich men coming down to the shore of acheron in lamenting and lamentable crowds casting their crowns into the dark waters and searching sometimes in vain for the last coin out of all their treasures that could ever be of use to them but these pagan views of the matter were indulgent compared with those which were held in the middle ages when wealth seems to have been looked upon by the best men not only as contemptible but as criminal the purse round the neck is then one of the principal signs of condemnation in the pictured inferno and the spirit of poverty is reverenced with subjection of heart and faithfulness of affection like that of a loyal knight for his lady or a loyal subject for his queen and truly it requires some boldness to quit ourselves of these feelings and to confess their partiality or their error which nevertheless we are certainly bound to do for wealth is simply one of the greatest powers which can be entrusted to human hands a power not indeed to be envied because it seldom makes us happy but still less to be abdicated or despised while in these days and in this country it has become a power all the more notable in that the possessions of a rich man are not represented as they used to be by wedges of gold or coffers of jewels but by masses of men variously employed over whose bodies and minds the wealth according to its direction exercises harmful or helpful influence and becomes in that alternative mammon either of unrighteousness or of righteousness now it seemed to me that since in the name you have given to this great gathering of british pictures you recognise them as treasures that is i suppose as part and parcel of the real wealth of the country you might not be uninterested in tracing certain commercial questions connected with this particular form of wealth most persons express themselves as surprised at its quantity not having known before to what an extent good art had been accumulated in england and it will therefore i should think be held a worthy subject of consideration what are the political interests involved in such accumulations what kind of labour they represent and how this labour may in general be applied and economized so as to produce the richest results now you must have patience with me if in approaching the specialty of this subject i dwell a little on certain points of general political science already known or established for though thus as i believe established some which i shall have occasion to rest arguments on are not yet by any means universally accepted and therefore though i will not lose time in any detailed defence of them it is necessary that i should distinctly tell you in what form i receive and wish to argue from them and this the more because there may perhaps be a part of my audience who have not interested themselves in political economy as it bears on ordinary fields of labour but may yet wish to hear in what way its principles can be applied to art i shall therefore take leave to trespass on your patience with a few elementary statements in the outset and with the expression of some general principles here and there in the course of our particular inquiry to begin then with one of these necessary truisms all economy whether of states households or individuals may be defined to be the art of managing labour the world is so regulated by the laws of providence that a man s labour well applied is always amply sufficient to provide him during his life with all things needful to him

cold though ses george rupert said he didn t mind and then he shut is eyes and pretended to be asleep his idea was to wait till george was asleep and then pinch is clothes consequently is feelings when e opened one eye and saw george getting into bed with is clothes on won t bear thinking about he laid awake for hours and three times that night george who was a very heavy sleeper woke up and found rupert busy tucking him in by the end of the week rupert was getting desperate he hated being black for one thing and the more he washed the better color he looked he didn t mind the black for out o doors in case the army was looking for im but aving no clothes he couldn t get out o doors and when he said he wouldn t perform unless he got some mr alfredi dropped ints about having im took up for a deserter i ve ad my suspicions of it for some days he ses with a wink though you did come to me in a nice serge suit and tell me you was an actor now you be a good boy for another week and i ll advance you a couple o pounds to get some clothes with rupert asked him to let im have it then but e wouldn t and for another week he ad to pretend e was a zulu of an evening and try and persuade kumbo that he was an english gentleman of a daytime he got the money at the end of the week and ad to sign a paper to give a month s notice any time he wanted to leave but he didn t mind that at all being determined the fust time he got outside the place to run away and ship as a nigger cook if e couldn t get the black off he made a list o things out for george to get for im but there seemed to be such a lot for two pounds that mr alfredi shook his ead over it and arter calling imself a soft arted fool and saying he d finish up in the workhouse he made it three pounds and told george to look sharp he s a very good marketer he ses arter george ad gone he don t mind wot trouble he takes he ll very likely haggle for hours to get sixpence knocked off the trousers or twopence off the shirt it was twelve o clock in the morning when george went and at ha past four rupert turned nasty and said e was afraid he was trying to get them for nothing at five o clock he said george was a fool,3

and sky of the merciless blaze of sun and of the whole superheated and implacable universe with which his fate was entangled the mate began to chuckle i told you you couldn t get away with it he said but griffiths was not listening with all his money coming around like a rent collector he chanted his outrage almost in an ecstasy of anger he s loaded with money he s stuffed with money he s busting with money i know for a fact he sold his yringa plantations for three hundred thousand pounds bell told me so himself last time we were drunk at guvutu worth millions and millions and shylocking me for what he wouldn t light his pipe with he whirled on the mate of course you told me so go on and say it and keep on saying it now just what was it you did tell me so i told you you didn t know him

cloth did not serve to hide the well put up body heavy muscled he was but he was not lumped and hummocked by muscles they were softly rounded and when they did move slid softly and silkily under the smooth tanned skin ardent suns had likewise tanned his face till it was swarthy as a spaniard s the yellow mustache appeared incongruous in the midst of such swarthiness while the clear blue of the

influence on the advancement of natural knowledge no delusion is greater than the notion that method and industry can make up for lack of motherwit either in science or in practical life and it is strange that with his knowledge of mankind bacon should have dreamed that his or any other via inveniendi scientias would level men s wits and leave little scope for that inborn capacity which is called genius as a matter of fact bacon s via has proved hopelessly impracticable while the anticipation of nature by the invention of hypotheses based on incomplete inductions which he specially condemns has proved itself to be a most efficient indeed an indispensable instrument of scientific progress finally that transcendental alchemy the superinducement of new forms on matter which bacon declares to be the supreme aim of science has been wholly ignored by those who have created the physical knowledge of the present day even the eloquent advocacy of the chancellor brought no unmixed good to physical science it was natural enough that the man who in his better moments took all knowledge for his patrimony but in his worse sold that birthright for the mess of pottage of court favor and professional success for pomp and show should be led to attach an undue value to the practical advantages which he foresaw as roger bacon and indeed seneca had foreseen long before his time must follow in the train of the advancement of natural knowledge the burden of bacon s pleadings for science is the gathering of fruit the importance of winning solid material advantages by the investigation of nature and the desirableness of limiting the application of scientific methods of inquiry to that field sidenote hobbes sidenote descartes bacon s younger contemporary hobbes casting aside the prudent reserve of his predecessor in regard to those matters about which the crown or the church might have something to say extended scientific methods of inquiry to the phenomena of mind and the problems of social organisation while at the same time he indicated the boundary between the province of real and that of imaginary knowledge the principles of philosophy and the leviathan embody a coherent system of purely scientific thought in language which is a model of clear and vigorous english style at the same time in france a man of far greater scientific capacity than either bacon or hobbes ren descartes not only in his immortal discours de la m thode and elsewhere went down to the foundations of scientific certainty but in his principes de philosophie indicated where the goal of physical science really lay however descartes was an eminent mathematician and it would seem that the bent of his mind led him to overestimate the value of deductive reasoning from general principles as much as bacon had underestimated it the progress of physical science has been effected neither by baconians nor by cartesians as such but by men like galileo and harvey boyle and newton who would have done their work just as well if neither bacon nor descartes had ever propounded their views respecting the manner in which scientific investigation should be pursued sidenote for a time the progress without fruits the progress of science during the first century after bacon s death by means verified his sanguine prediction of the fruits which it would yield for though the revived and renewed study of nature had spread and grown to an extent which surpassed reasonable expectation the practical results the good to men s estate were at first by no means apparent sixty years after bacon s death newton had crowned the long labors of the astronomers and the physicists by coordinating the phenomena of solar motion throughout the visible universe into one vast system but the principia helped no man to either wealth or comfort descartes newton and leibnitz had opened up new worlds to the mathematician but the acquisitions of their genius enriched only man s ideal estate descartes had laid the foundations of rational cosmogony and of physiological psychology boyle had produced models of experimentation in various branches of physics and chemistry pascal and torricelli

for a train she must have or the whole thing would be an utter failure a little sacque was eked out however and when the frills were on it was ravishing as kitty said with a sigh of mingled delight and fatigue the gored skirt was a fearful job as any one who has ever plunged into the mysteries will testify and before the facing even experienced pris quailed the bonnet also was a trial for when the lace was on it was discovered that the ribbons didn t match the dress here was a catastrophe kitty frantically rummaged the house the shops the stores of her friends and rummaged in vain there was no time to send to the city and despair was about to fall on kitty when pris rescued her by quietly making one of the small sacrifices which were easy to her because her life was spent for others some one suggested a strip of blue illusion and that could be got but alas kitty had no money for the gloves were already bought pris heard the lamentations and giving up fresh ribbons for herself pulled her sister out of a slough of despond with two yards of heavenly tulle now the daisies and oh dear me not one can i find in this poverty stricken town sighed kitty prinking at the glass and fervently hoping that nothing would happen to her complexion over night i see plenty just like those on your dress answered pris nodding toward the meadow full of young whiteweed pris you re a treasure i ll wear real ones they keep well i know and are so common i can refresh my bonnet anywhere it s a splendid idea away rushed kitty to return with an apron full of american daisies a pretty cluster was soon fastened just over the left hand frizzle of bright hair and the little bonnet was complete now pris tell me how i look cried kitty as she swept into the room late that afternoon in full gala costume it would have been impossible for the primmest the sourest or the most sensible creature in the world to say that it wasn t a pretty sight the long train the big chignon the apology for a bonnet were all ridiculous no one could deny that but youth beauty and a happy heart made even those absurdities charming the erect young figure gave an air to the crisp folds of the delicate dress the bright eyes and fresh cheeks under the lace rosette made one forget its size and the rippling brown hair won admiration in spite of the ugly bunch which disfigured the girl s head the little jacket set divinely the new gloves were as immaculate as white kids could be and to crown all lizzie king in a burst of generosity lent kitty the blue and white paris sunshade which she couldn t use herself now i could die content i m perfect in all respects and i know jack won t be ashamed of me i really owe it to him to look my best you know and that s why i m so particular said kitty in an apologetic tone as she began to lay away her finery i hope you will enjoy every minute of the time deary don t forget to finish running up the facing i ve basted it carefully and would do it if my head didn t ache so i really can t hold it up any longer answered pris who had worked like a disinterested bee while kitty had flown about like a distracted butterfly go and lie down you dear kind soul and don t think of my nonsense again said kitty feeling remorseful till pris was comfortably asleep when she went to her room and revelled in her finery till bedtime so absorbed was she in learning to manage her train gracefully that she forgot the facing till very late then being worn out with work and worry she did what girls are too apt to do stuck a pin here and there and trusting to priscilla s careful bastings left it as it was retiring to dream of a certain horace fletcher whose aristocratic elegance had made a deep impression upon her during the few evenings she had seen him nothing could have been lovelier than the morning and few hearts happier than kitty s as she arrayed herself with the utmost care and waited in solemn state for the carriage for muslin trains and dewy roads were incompatible and one luxury brought another my goodness where did she get that stylish suit whispered miss smith to miss jones as kitty floated into the station with all sail set finding it impossible to resist the temptation to astonish certain young ladies who had snubbed her in times past which snubs had rankled and were now avenged i looked everywhere for a muslin for to day and couldn t find any i liked so i was forced to wear my mauve silk observed miss smith complacently settling the silvery folds of her dress it s very pretty but one ruins a silk at class day you know i thought this organdie would be more comfortable and appropriate this warm day a friend brought it from paris and it s like one the princess of wales wore at the great flower show this year returned kitty with the air of a young lady who had all her dresses from paris and was intimately acquainted with the royal family those girls were entirely extinguished by this stroke and hadn t a word to say for themselves while kitty casually mentioned horace fletcher lyceum hall and cousin jack for they had only a little freshman brother to boast of and were not going to lyceum hall as she stepped out of the cars at cambridge jack opened his honest blue eyes and indulged in a low whistle of astonishment for if there was anything he especially hated it was the trains chignons and tiny bonnets then in fashion he was very fond of kitty and prided himself on being able to show his friends a girl who was charming and yet not over dressed she has made a regular guy of herself i won t tell her so and the dear little soul shall have a jolly time in spite of her fuss and feathers but i do wish she had let her hair alone and worn that pretty hat of hers as,3

hailed as contributions to our latest cult in all these fields pyle s work may be equaled surpassed save in one it is improbable that anyone else will ever bring his combination of interest and talent to the depiction of these old time pirates any more than there could be a second remington to paint the now extinct indians and gun fighters of the great west important and interesting to the student of history the adventure lover and the artist as they are these pirate stories and pictures have been scattered through many magazines and books here in this volume they are gathered together for the first time perhaps not just as mr pyle would have done but with a completeness and appreciation of the real value of the material which the author s modesty might not have permitted merle johnson illustration illustration preface why is it that a little spice of deviltry lends not an unpleasantly titillating twang to the great mass of respectable flour that goes to make up the pudding of our modern civilization and pertinent to this question another why is it that the pirate has and always has had a certain lurid glamour of the heroical enveloping him round about is there deep under the accumulated debris of culture a hidden groundwork of the old time savage is there even in these well regulated times an unsubdued nature in the respectable mental household of every one of us that still kicks against the pricks of law and order to make my meaning more clear would not every boy for instance that is every boy of any account rather be a pirate captain than a member of parliament and we ourselves would we not rather read such a story as that of captain avery s capture of the east indian treasure ship with its beautiful princess and load of jewels which gems he sold by the handful history sayeth to a bristol merchant than say one of bishop atterbury s sermons or the goodly master robert boyle s religious romance of theodora and didymus it is to be apprehended that to the unregenerate nature of most of us there can be but one answer to such a query in the pleasurable warmth the heart feels in answer to tales of derring do nelson s battles are all mightily interesting but even in spite of their romance of splendid courage i fancy that the majority of us would rather turn back over the leaves of history to read how drake captured the spanish treasure ship in the south sea and of how he divided such a quantity of booty in the island of plate so named because of the tremendous dividend there declared that it had to be measured in quart bowls being too considerable to be counted courage and daring no matter how mad and ungodly have always a redundancy of vim and life to recommend them to the nether man that lies within us and no doubt his desperate courage his battle against the tremendous odds of all the civilized world of law and order have had much to do in making a popular hero of our friend of the black flag but it is not altogether courage and daring that endear him to our hearts there is another and perhaps a greater kinship in that lust for wealth that makes one s fancy revel more pleasantly in the story of the division of treasure in the pirate s island retreat the hiding of his godless gains somewhere in the sandy stretch of tropic beach there to remain hidden until the time should come to rake the doubloons up again and to spend them like a lord in polite society than in the most thrilling tales of his wonderful escapes from commissioned cruisers through tortuous channels between the coral reefs and what a life of adventure is his to be sure a life of constant alertness constant danger constant escape an ocean ishmaelite he wanders forever aimlessly homelessly now unheard of for months now careening his boat on some lonely uninhabited shore now appearing suddenly to swoop down on some merchant vessel with rattle of musketry shouting yells and a hell of unbridled passions let loose to rend and tear what a carlislean hero what a setting of blood and lust and flame and rapine for such a hero piracy such as was practiced in the flower of its days that is during the early eighteenth century was no sudden growth it was an evolution from the semilawful buccaneering of the sixteenth century just as buccaneering was upon its part in a certain sense an evolution from the unorganized unauthorized warfare of the tudor period for there was a deal of piratical smack in the anti spanish ventures of elizabethan days many of the adventurers of the sir francis drake school for instance actually overstepped again and again the bounds of international law entering into the realms of de facto piracy nevertheless while their doings were not recognized officially by the government the perpetrators were neither punished nor reprimanded for their excursions against spanish commerce at home or in the west indies rather were they commended and it was considered not altogether a discreditable thing for men to get rich upon the spoils taken from spanish galleons in times of nominal peace many of the most reputable citizens and merchants of london when they felt that the queen failed in her duty of pushing the fight against the great catholic power fitted out fleets upon their own account and sent them to levy good protestant war of a private nature upon the pope s anointed some of the treasures captured in such ventures were immense stupendous unbelievable for an example one can hardly credit the truth of the purchase gained by drake in the famous capture of the plate ship in the south sea one of the old buccaneer writers of a century later says the spaniards affirm to this day that he took at that time twelvescore tons of plate and sixteen bowls of coined money a

settled in the north had brought with them the vigour of their race they had taken up such dead or dying culture as they found in france and were carrying it further so as in some degree to awaken their neighbours kings and their great vassals could generally read and write and understand the latin in which all records were made but few except the clergy studied at all there were schools in convents and already at paris a university was growing up for the study of theology grammar law philosophy and music the sciences which were held to form a course of education the doctors of these sciences lectured the scholars of low degree lived begged and struggled as best they could and gentlemen were lodged with clergy who served as a sort of private tutors earlier kings of the house of paris neither hugh nor the next three kings robert henry philip were able men and they were almost helpless among the fierce nobles of their own domain and the great counts and dukes around them castles were built of huge strength and served as nests of plunderers who preyed on travellers and made war on each other grievously tormenting one another s villeins as the peasants were termed men could travel nowhere in safety and horrid ferocity and misery prevailed the first three kings were good and pious men but too weak to deal with their ruffian nobles robert called the pious was extremely devout but weak he became embroiled with the pope on account of having married bertha a lady pronounced to be within the degrees of affinity prohibited by the church he was excommunicated but held out till there was a great religious reaction produced by the belief that the world would end in in this expectation many persons left their land untilled and the consequence was a terrible famine followed by a pestilence and the misery of france was probably unequalled in this reign when it was hardly possible to pass safely from one to another of the three royal cities paris orleans and tours beggars swarmed and the king gave to them everything he could lay his hands on and even winked at their stealing gold off his dress to the great wrath of a second wife the imperious constance of provence who coming from the more luxurious and corrupt south hated and despised the roughness and asceticism of her husband she was a fierce and passionate woman and brought an element of cruelty into the court in this reign the first instance of persecution to the death for heresy took place the victim had been the queen s confessor but so far was she from pitying him that she struck out one of his eyes with her staff as he was led past her to the hut where he was shut in and burnt on robert s death constance took part against her son henry i on behalf of his younger brother but henry prevailed during his reign the clergy succeeded in proclaiming what was called the truce of god which forbade war and bloodshed at certain seasons of the year and on certain days of the week and made churches and clerical lands places of refuge and sanctuary which often indeed protected the lawless but which also saved the weak and oppressed it was during these reigns that the papacy was beginning the great struggle for temporal power and freedom from the influence of the empire which resulted in the increased independence and power of the clergy the religious fervour which had begun with the century led to the foundation of many monasteries and to much grand church architecture in the reign of philip i william duke of normandy obtained the kingdom of england and thus became far more powerful than his suzerain the king of france a weak man of vicious habits who lay for many years of his life under sentence of excommunication for an adulterous marriage with bertrade de montfort countess of anjou the power of the king and of the law was probably at the very lowest ebb during the time of philip i though minds and manners were less debased than in the former century the first crusade pilgrimage to the holy land had now become one great means by which the men of the west sought pardon for their sins jerusalem had long been held by the arabs who had treated the pilgrims well but these had been conquered by a fierce turcoman tribe who robbed and oppressed the pilgrims peter the hermit returning from a pilgrimage persuaded pope urban ii that it would be well to stir up christendom to drive back the moslem power and deliver jerusalem and the holy places urban ii accordingly when holding a council at clermont in auvergne permitted peter to describe in glowing words the miseries of pilgrims and the profanation of the holy places cries broke out god wills it and multitudes thronged to receive crosses cut out in cloth which were fastened to the shoulder and pledged the wearer to the holy war or crusade as it was called philip i took no interest in the cause but his brother hugh count of vermandois stephen count of blois robert duke of normandy and raymond count of toulouse joined the expedition which was made under godfrey of bouillon duke of lower lorraine or what we now call the netherlands the crusade proved successful jerusalem was gained and a kingdom of detached cities and forts was founded in palestine of which godfrey became the first king the whole of the west was supposed to keep up the defence of the holy land but in

for myself i feel really as if i should gain all i desire i meet a great many americans who as a general thing i must say are not as polite to me as the people over here the people over here especially the gentlemen are much more what i should call attentive i don t know whether americans are more sincere i haven t yet made up my mind about that the only drawback i experience is when americans sometimes express surprise that i should be travelling round alone so you see it doesn t come from europeans i always have my answer ready for general culture to acquire the languages and to see europe for myself and that generally seems to satisfy them dear mother my money holds out very well and it is real interesting chapter ii from the same to the same september th since i last wrote to you i have left that hotel and come to live in a french family it s a kind of boarding house combined with a kind of school only it s not like an american hoarding house nor like an american school either there are four or five people here that have come to learn the language not to take lessons but to have an opportunity for conversation i was very glad to come to such a place for i had begun to realise that i was not making much progress with the french it seemed to me that i should feel ashamed to have spent two months in paris and not to have acquired more insight into the language i had always heard so much of french conversation and i found i was having no more opportunity to practise it than if i had remained at bangor in fact i used to hear a great deal more at bangor from those french canadians that came down to cut the ice than i saw i should ever hear at that hotel the lady that kept the books seemed to want so much to talk to me in english for the sake of practice too i suppose that i couldn t bear to let her know i didn t like it the chambermaid was irish and all the waiters were german so that i never heard a word of french spoken i suppose you might hear a great deal in the shops only as i don t buy anything i prefer to spend my money for purposes of culture i don t have that advantage i have been thinking some of taking a teacher but i am well acquainted with the grammar already and teachers always keep you bothering over the verbs i was a good deal troubled for i felt as if i didn t want to go away without having at least got a general idea of french conversation the theatre gives you a good deal of insight and as i told you in my last i go a good deal to places of amusement i find no difficulty whatever in going to such places alone and am always treated with the politeness which as i told you before i encounter everywhere i see plenty of other ladies alone mostly french and they generally seem to be enjoying themselves as much as i but at the theatre every one talks so fast that i can scarcely make out what they say and besides there are a great many vulgar expressions which it is unnecessary to learn but it was the theatre nevertheless that put me on the track the very next day after i wrote to you last i went to the palais royal which is one of the principal theatres in paris it is very small but it is very celebrated and in my guide book it is marked with two stars which is a sign of importance attached only to first class objects of interest but after i had been there half an hour i found i couldn t understand a single word of the play they gabbled it off so fast and they made use of such peculiar expressions i felt a good deal disappointed and troubled i was afraid i shouldn t gain all i had come for but while i was thinking it over thinking what i should do i heard two gentlemen talking behind me it was between the acts and i couldn t help listening to what they said they were talking english but i guess they were americans well said one of them it all depends on what you are after i m french that s what i m after well said the other i m after art well said the first i m after art too but i m after french most then dear mother i am sorry to say the second one swore a little he said oh damn french no i won t damn french said his friend i ll acquire it that s what i ll do with it i ll go right into a family what family ll you go into into some french family that s the only way to do to go to some place where you can talk if you re after art you want to stick to the galleries you want to go right through the louvre room by room you want to take a room a day or something of that sort but if you want to acquire french the thing is to look out for a family there are lots of french families here that take you to board and teach you my second cousin that young lady i told you about she got in with a crowd like that and they booked her right up in three months they just took her right in and they talked to her that s what they do to you they set you right down and they talk at you you ve got to understand them you can t help yourself that family my cousin was with

childish so full of pathetic self assertion was still on her lips when a couple of men came out of the dining room and paused to buy some cigars at the counter one of them was at first sight a very handsome man of pronounced western sort he wore a long gray frock coat without vest and a dark blue stiffly starched shirt over which a red necktie fluttered his carriage was erect his hands large of motion and his profile very fine in its bold lines his eyes were gray and in expression cold and penetrating his nose was broad and the corners of his mouth bitter he could not be called young and yet he was not even middle aged his voice was deep and harsh in accent but as he spoke to the girl a certain sweetness came into it well babe here i am again couldn t get along without coming down to

what i came down here to tell you you can boss my ranch any day the girl was visibly alarmed but as she still stood fascinated by his eyes and voice struggling to recover her serenity another group of diners came noisily past and the big man with a parting look went out and took a seat on one of the chairs which stood in a row upon the walk the hand which held the cigar visibly trembled and his companion said be careful mart haney silenced him with a look you re on the outside here partner i didn t mean to butt in i understand but this is a matter between that little girl and me replied the big man in a tone that while friendly ended all further remark on the part of his companion who rose after a little pause and walked away haney remained seated buried in thought amazed at the fever which his encounter with the girl had put into his blood it was true that he had been coming down every saturday for weeks leaving his big saloon on the best evening in the week for a chance to see this child this boyish school girl in a savage selfish and unrestrained way he loved her and had determined to possess her to buy her if necessary he knew something of the toil through which the weary mother plodded and he watched her bend and fade with a certainty that she would one day be on his side when at home and afar from her he felt capable of seizing the girl of carrying her back with him as the old time savage won his bride but when he looked into her clear calm eyes his villiany his resolution fell away from him he found himself not merely a man of the nearer time but a catholic in training at least and the words he had planned to utter fell dead on his lips libertine though he was there were lines over which even his lawlessness could not break he was a desperate character a man of violence and none too delicate in his life among women but away back in his boyhood his good irish mother had taught him to fight fair and to protect the younger and weaker children and this

slowly down the desolate little street by the time he had walked a dozen yards he began to think that he might as well have waited until the morning before he had walked fifty he was certain of it he passed the night at a coffee house and rose so early in the morning that the proprietor took it as a personal affront and advised him to get his breakfast elsewhere it was the longest day in mr hatchard s experience and securing modest lodgings that evening he overslept himself and was late at the warehouse next morning for the first time in ten years his personal effects arrived next day but no letter came from his wife and one which he wrote concerning a pair of missing garments received no reply he wrote again referring to them in laudatory terms and got a brief reply to the effect that they had been exchanged in part payment on a pair of valuable pink vases the pieces of which he could have by paying the carriage in six weeks mr hatchard changed his lodgings twice a lack of those home comforts which he had taken as a matter of course during his married life was a source of much tribulation and it was clear that his weekly bills were compiled by a clever writer of fiction it was his first experience of lodgings and the difficulty of saying unpleasant things to a woman other than his wife was not the least of his troubles he changed his lodgings for a third time and much surprised at his wife s continued silence sought out a cousin of hers named joe pett and poured his troubles into that gentleman s reluctant ear if she was to ask me to take her back he concluded i m not sure mind you that i wouldn t do so it does you credit said mr pett well ta ta i must be off and i expect she d be very much obliged to anybody that told her so said mr hatchard clutching at the other s sleeve mr pett gazing into space said that he thought it highly probable it wants to be done cleverly though said mr hatchard else she might get the idea that i wanted to go back i s pose

calling herself mrs harris after her maiden name he went off before mr hatchard could recover and the latter at once verified the information in part by walking round to his old house bits of straw and paper littered the front garden the blinds were down and a bill was pasted on the front parlor window aghast at such determination he walked back to his lodgings in gloomy thought on saturday afternoon he walked round to john street and from the corner of his eye as he passed stole a glance at no he recognized the curtains at once and seeing that there was nobody in the room leaned over the palings and peered at a card that stood on the window sash furnished apartments for single young man board if desired he walked away whistling and after going a little way turned and passed it again he passed in all four times and then with an odd grin lurking at the corners of his mouth strode up to the front door and knocked loudly he heard somebody moving about inside and more with the idea of keeping his courage up than anything else gave another heavy knock at the door it was thrown open hastily and the astonished face of his wife appeared before him what do you want she inquired

hard green rock was left after the glaciers were gone the ohio climate was still very cold and vast lakes stretched over the state freezing in the long winters and thawing in the short summers one of these spread upward from the neighborhood of akron to the east and west of where cleveland stands but by far the largest flooded nearly all that part of ohio which the glaciers failed to cover from beyond where pittsburg is to where cincinnati is at the last point a mighty ice dam formed every winter till as the climate grew warmer and the ice thawed more and more the waters burst the dam and poured their tide down the ohio river to the mississippi while those of the northern lake rushed through the cuyahoga to lake erie and both lakes disappeared forever for the next four or five thousand years the early ohio men kept very quiet but we need not suppose for that reason that there were none our ice folk who dropped their stone axes in the river banks may have passed away with the ice age or they may have remained in ohio and begun slowly to take on some faint likeness of civilization there is nothing to prove that they went and there is nothing to prove that they staid but ohio must always have been a pleasant place to live in after the great thaw and it seems reasonable to think that the ice folk lingered in part at least and changed with the changing climate and became at last the people who left the signs of their presence in almost every part of the state those were the mound builders whose works are said to be two or three thousand years old though we cannot be very sure of that there are some who think that the mounds are only a few hundred years old and that their builders were the race of red men whom the white men found here one may think very much as one likes and i like to think that the mound builders were a very ancient people who vanished many ages before the indians came here they could not have been savages for the region where they dwelt could not have fed savages enough to heap up the multitude of their mounds each wild man needs fifty thousand acres to live upon as the wild man lives by hunting and fishing in the whole ohio country the earliest white adventurers found only two or three thousand indians at the most and the people who built those forts and temples and tombs and shaped from the earth the mighty images of their strange bird gods and reptile gods could have lived only by tilling the soil their mounds are found everywhere in the west between the alleghany mountains and the mississippi river but they are found mostly in ohio where their farms and gardens once bordered the muskingum the scioto the two miamis and our other large streams which they probably used as highways to the rivers of the southwest their forts were earthworks but they were skillfully planned with a knowledge which no savage race has shown they were real strongholds and they are so large that some of them inclose hundreds of acres within walls of earth which still rise ten and twelve feet from the ground they are on a far grander scale than the supposed temples or religious works and there are more of them than of all the other ruins except the small detached mounds which are almost numberless these from the charred bones found among the ashes in them are known to be tombs and they were probably the sepulchers of the common people whose bodies were burned the large mounds are heaped above walled chambers and in these were platforms supposed to have been altars and whole skeletons supposed to be the skeletons of priests buried there the priests are supposed to have been the chiefs of the people and to have ruled them through their superstitions but there is nothing to prove this for their laws were never put in written words or any other sign of speech in some of the mounds little figures of burnt clay have been found which may be idols and pieces of ancient pottery which may be fragments of sacred vessels and small plates of copper with marks or scratches on them which may be letters some antiquarians have tried to read these letters if they are letters and to make sense out of them but no seeker after true ohio stories can trust their interpretations the mound builders used very little stone and showed no knowledge of masonry but they built so massively out of the earth that their works have lasted to this day in many places just as they left them except for the heavy growth of trees which the first settlers found covering them and which were sometimes seven or eight hundred years old at marietta these works when the white people came were quite perfect and inclosed fifty acres on the bank of the muskingum overlooking the ohio they were in great variety of design the largest mound was included in the grounds of the present cemetery and so has been saved but the plow of the new england emigrant soon passed over the foundations of the mound builders temples at circleville the shape of their fortifications gave its name to the town which has long since hid them from sight one of them was almost perfectly round and the other nearly square the round fort was about seventy feet in diameter and was formed of two walls twenty feet high with a deep ditch between the other fort was fifty five rods square and it had no ditch seven gateways opened into it at the side and corners and it was joined to the round fort by an eighth it is forever to be regretted that these precious ancient works should have been destroyed to make place for the present town but within a few years one of the most marvelous of the mound builders works the great serpent mound near loudon in adams county has been preserved to after time by the friends of science and put in the keeping of the peabody museum

mr st gaudens s statue of the puritan his clothes were slightly shabby but always neat little as one might have guessed it however what may be called a certain transmuted enthusiasm was alive in him he had a hobby almost amounting to an obsession not uncommon amongst americans who have slipped downward in the social scale it was the bumpus family in america he collected documents about his ancestors and relations he wrote letters with a fine painful penmanship on a ruled block he bought at hartshorne s drug store to distant bumpuses in kansas and illinois and michigan common descendants of ebenezer the original immigrant of dolton many of these western kinsmen answered not so the magisterial bumpus who lived in boston on the water side of beacon whom likewise he had ventured to address to the indignation and disgust of his elder daughter janet why are you so proud of ebenezer she demanded once scornfully why aren t we descended from him how many generations seven said edward promptly emphasizing the last syllable janet was quick at figures she made a mental calculation well you ve got one hundred and twenty seven other ancestors of ebenezer s time haven t you edward was a little surprised he had never thought of this but his ardour for ebenezer remained undampened genealogy his own had become his religion and instead of going to church he spent his sunday mornings poring over papers of various degrees of discolouration making careful notes on the ruled block this consciousness of his descent from good american stock that had somehow been deprived of its heritage while a grievance to him was also a comfort it had a compensating side in spite of the lack of sympathy of his daughters and his wife hannah bumpus took the situation more grimly she was a logical projection in a new environment of the religious fatalism of ancestors whose god was a god of vengeance she did not concern herself as to what all this vengeance was about life was a trap into which all mortals walked sooner or later and her particular trap had a treadmill a round of household duties she kept whirling with an energy that might have made their fortunes if she had been the head of the family it is bad to be a fatalist unless one has an incontrovertible belief in one s destiny which hannah had not but she kept the little flat with its worn furniture which had known so many journeys as clean as a merchant ship of old salem and when it was scoured and dusted to her satisfaction she would sally forth to bonnaccossi s grocery and provision store on the corner to do her bargaining in competition with the italian housewives of the neighborhood she was wont indeed to pause outside for a moment her quick eye encompassing the coloured prints of red and yellow jellies cast in rounded moulds decked with slices of orange the gaudy boxes of cereals and buckwheat flour the brookfield eggs in packages significant this modern package system of an era of flats with little storage space she took in at a glance the blue lettered placard announcing the current price of butterine and walked around to the other side of the store on holmes street where the beef and bacon hung where the sidewalk stands were filled in the autumn with cranberries apples cabbages and spinach with little outer complaint she had adapted herself to the constantly lowering levels to which her husband had dropped and if she hoped that in fillmore street they had reached bottom she did not say so her unbetrayed regret was for the loss of what she would have called respectability and the giving up long ago in the little city which had been their home of the servant girl had been the first wrench until they came to hampton they had always lived in houses and her adaptation to a flat had been hard a flat without a parlour hannah bumpus regarded a parlour as necessary to a respectable family as a wedding ring to a virtuous woman janet and lise would be growing up there would be young men and no place to see them save the sidewalks the fear that haunted her came true and she never was reconciled the two girls went to the public schools and afterwards inevitably to work and it seemed to be a part of her punishment for the sins of her forefathers that she had no more control over them than if they had been boarders while she looked on helplessly they did what they pleased janet whom she never understood was almost as much a source of apprehension as lise who became part and parcel of all hannah deemed reprehensible in this new america which she refused to recognize and acknowledge as her own country to send them through the public schools had been a struggle hannah used to lie awake nights wondering what would happen if edward became sick it worried her that they never saved any money try as she would to cut the expenses down there was a limit of decency new england thrift hitherto justly celebrated was put to shame by that which the foreigners displayed and which would have delighted the souls of gentlemen of the manchester school every once in a while there rose up before her fabulous instances of this thrift of italians and jews who ignorant emigrants had entered the mills only a few years before they the bumpuses had come to hampton and were now independent property owners still rankling in hannah s memory was a day when lise had returned from school dark and mutinous with a tale of such a family one of the younger children was a classmate they live on jordan street in a house and laura has roller skates i don t see why i can t this was one

was quite right unc billy had forgotten all about that dinner you see he had something else on his mind while he had been playing with his children he had thought that he heard a voice way off in the distance and it had sounded very very much like the voice of an old friend from way down south in ol virginny he had listened and listened but didn t hear it again and yet he was sure he had heard it

may complain of misinterpretation if the greater part of miss taylor s article with which i entirely sympathise is supposed to be applicable to my intolerance let us have full toleration by all means upon all questions in which there is room for doubt or which cannot be distinctly proved to affect the welfare of mankind but when miss taylor has shown what basis exists for criminal legislation except the clear right of mankind not to tolerate that which is demonstrably contrary to the welfare of society i will admit that such demonstration ought only to be believed in by the curates and old women to whom she refers recent events have not weakened the conviction i expressed in a much abused speech at the london school board that ultramontanism is demonstrably the enemy of society and must be met with resistance merely passive if possible but active if necessary by the whole power of the state next in order it seems proper that i should briefly refer to my friend mr mivart s onslaught upon my criticism of mr darwin s critics himself among the number which will be found in this volume in evolution and its consequences i am accused of misrepresentation misquotation misunderstanding and numerous other negative and positive literary and scientific sins and much subtle ingenuity is expended by mr mivart in attempting to extricate himself from the position in which my exposition of the real opinions of father suarez has placed him so much more in fact has mr mivart s ingenuity impressed me than any other feature of his reply that i shall take the liberty of re stating the main issue between us and for the present leaving that issue alone to the judgment of the public footnote contemporary review january in his book on the genesis of species mr mivart after discussing the opinions of sundry catholic writers of authority among whom he especially includes st augustin st thomas aquinas and the jesuit suarez proceeds to say it is then evident that ancient and most venerable theological authorities distinctly assert derivative creation and thus their teachings harmonize with all that modern science can possibly require by the derivative creation of organic forms mr mivart understands that god created them by conferring on the material world the power to evolve them under suitable conditions footnote bunsen s outlines of the philosophy of universal history vol i p on the contrary i proved by evidence which mr mivart does not venture to impugn that suarez in his tractatus de opere sex dierum expressly rejects st augustin s and st thomas views that he vehemently advocates the literal interpretation of the account of the creation given in the book of genesis and that he treats with utter scorn the notion that the almighty could have used the language of that book unless he meant it to be taken literally mr mivart therefore either has read suarez and has totally misrepresented him a hypothesis which i hope i need hardly say i do not for a moment entertain or he has got his information at second hand and has himself been deceived but in that case it is surely an imprudence on his part to reproach me with having read suarez ad hoc and evidently without the guidance of anyone familiar with that author no doubt in the matter of guidance mr mivart has the advantage of me nevertheless the guides who supplied him with his references to suarez metaphysica while they left him in ignorance of the existence of the tractatus are guides with whose services it might be better to dispense leaders who wilfully shut their eyes being even more liable to lodge one in a ditch than blind leaders at the time when the essay on methods and results of ethnology was written i had not met with a passage in professor max m ller s last results of turanian researches which shows so appositely that the profoundest study of philology leads to conclusions respecting the relation of ethnology with philology similar to those at which i had arrived in approaching the question from the anatomist s side that i cannot refrain from quoting it footnote london april nor should we in our phonological studies either expect or desire more than general hints from physical ethnology the proper and rational connection between the two sciences is that of mutual advice and suggestion but nothing more much of the confusion of terms and indistinctness of principles both in ethnology and phonology are due to the combined study of these heterogeneous sciences ethnological race and phonological race are not commensurate except in ante historical times or perhaps at the very dawn of history with the migration of tribes their wars their colonies their conquests and alliances which if we may judge from their effects must have been much more violent in the ethnic than even in the political period of history it is impossible to imagine that race and language should continue to run parallel the physiologist should pursue his own science unconcerned about language it is further desirable to remark that the statements in this essay respecting the forms of native american crania need rectification on this point i refer the reader who is interested in the subject to my paper on the form of the cranium among the patagonians and the fuegians published in the journal of anatomy and physiology for if the problem discussed in my address to the british association in has not yet received its solution it is not because the champions of abiogenesis have been idle or wanting in confidence but every new assertion on their side has been met by a

discipline as participation in mightier scenes those who write concrete history without ever having taken part in practical politics are one might say in the position of those ancients who wrote about the human body without ever having effectively explored it by dissection mr carlyle it is true by force of penetrating imaginative genius has reproduced in stirring and resplendent dithyrambs the fire and passion the rage and tears the many tinted dawn and the blood red sunset of the french revolution and the more a man learns about the details of the revolution the greater is his admiration for mr carlyle s magnificent performance but it is dramatic presentation not social analysis a masterpiece of literature not a scientific investigation a prodigy of poetic insight not a sane and quantitative exploration of the complex processes the deep lying economical fiscal and political conditions that prepared so immense an explosion we have to remember it is true that m taine is not professing to write a history in the ordinary sense his book lies if we may use two very pompous but indispensable words partly in the region of historiography but much more in the region of sociology the study of the french revolution cannot yet be a history of the past for the french still walk per ignes suppositos and the revolution is still some way from being fully accomplished it was the disputes between the roman and the reformed churches which inspired historical research in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries it is the disputes among french parties that now inspire what professes to be historiography but what is really a sort of experimental investigation in the science of society they little know how long and weary a journey lies before them said burke who undertake to bring great masses of men into the political unity of a nation the process is still going on and a man of m taine s lively intellectual sensibility can no more escape its influences than he can escape the ingredients of the air he breathes we may add that if his work had been really historic he must inevitably have gone further back than the eighteenth century for the origins of contemporary france the very slight vague and unsubstantial chapter with which he opens his work cannot be accepted as a substitute for what the subject really demanded a serious summary however condensed and rapid of the various forces accidents deliberate lines of policy which from the breaking up of the great fiefs down to the death of lewis the fourteenth had prepared the distractions of the monarchy under lewis s descendants full of interest as it is m taine s book can hardly be described as containing much that is new or strikingly significant he develops one idea indeed which we have never before seen stated in its present form but which if it implies more than has been often advanced by previous writers in other forms cannot be accepted as true this is perhaps a point better worth discussing than any other which his book raises the rest is a very elaborate and thorough description of the structure of society of its physiognomy in manners and characteristics the privileges the burdens the daily walk and conversation of the various classes which made up the french people between the regency and the revolution m taine s method of description does not strike one as altogether happy it is a common complaint against french historians that they are too lax about their authorities and too heedless about giving us chapter and verse for their assertions m taine goes to the contrary extreme and pours his note books into his text with a steady handed profusion that is excessively fatiguing and makes the result far less effective than it would have been if all this industrious reading had been thoroughly fused and recast into a homogeneous whole it is an ungenerous trick of criticism to disparage good work by comparing it with better but the reader can scarcely help contrasting m taine s overcrowded pages with the perfect assimilation the pithy fulness the pregnant meditation of de tocqueville s book on the same subject when we attempt to reduce m taine s chapters to a body of propositions standing out in definite relief from one another yet conveying a certain unity of interpretation we soon feel how possible it is for an author to have literary clearness along with historic obscurity in another respect we are inclined to question the felicity of m taine s method it does not convey the impression of movement the steps and changes in the conflict among the organs of the old society are not marked in their order and succession the reader is not kept alive to the gradual progress of the break up of old institutions and ideas the sense of an active and ceaseless struggle extending in various stages across the century is effaced by an exclusive attention to the social details of a given phase we need the story you cannot effectively reproduce the true sense and significance of such an epoch as the eighteenth century in france without telling us however barely the tale for example of the long battle of the ecclesiastical factions and the yet more important series of battles between the judiciary and the crown if m taine s book were a piece of abstract social analysis the above remark would not be true but it is a study of the concrete facts of french life and society,3

distance and it had sounded very very much like the voice of an old friend from way down south in ol virginny he had listened and listened but didn t hear it again and yet he was sure he had heard it that once the very thought that that old friend of his might be somewhere in the green forest excited unc billy so that it fairly made him homesick he just had to go look for him so all the rest of

her had been so serious that when she landed she could not travel until after a few days rest the marriage of the third son had been a much greater surprise compton poynsett was not a family living but the patron hearing of julius charnock as a hard working curate in a distant seaport wrote to offer it to him and the same letter to mrs poynsett to offer it to him and the same letter to mrs

charge her father enjoyed the barren honours of the earldom of rathforlane an unimprovable estate in a remote corner of ireland burthened with successive families of numerous daughters so that he was

sentences as if constrained by the mother s anxious gaze and he was quite well when you parted with him quite ah you nursed my boy and we must nurse you for him thank you i am quite well but she bit her lip and spoke constrainedly as if too shy and reserved to give way to the rush of emotion but the coldness pained mrs poynsett whose expansiveness was easily checked and a brief silence was followed by charlie s return to report that he could not find nurse and thought she was out with the other servants watching for the arrival in another moment the approaching cheers caused him to rush out and after many more noises showing the excitement of the multitude and the advance of the bridal pair during which mrs poynsett lay with deepening colour and clasped hands her nostrils dilating

agitated and then there ran from its root a black headed rat with wings such was the general effect i was not less interested when my startled eyes divided this phenomenon into its component parts and recognized in the disturbance on the opposite bank only another fierce struggle among the hungry animals for existence they need no professor to teach them the doctrine of the survival of the fittest a weasel had gripped a water hen whit rit and beltie they are called in these parts cowering at the root of the rose bush and was being dragged down the bank by the terrified bird which made for the

told me himself he said the beggar was too small for him to lick and that duelling was ridiculous they didn t take that view of it at shephard s hotel well it is not my affair said maitland one should see all sort of characters bielby says this is not an ordinary fellow why he has been a sailor before the mast he says by way of adventure and he is full of good stories i rather like him and he can t do my moral character any harm i m not likely to deal in coolies at my time of life nor quarrel with warlike aliens no but he s not a good man to introduce to these boys from oxford barton was saying when the subject of their conversation came up surrounded by his little court of undergraduates the hon thomas cranley was a good deal older than the company in which he found himself without being one of the hoary youths who play falstaff to every fresh heir s prince harry he was a middle aged man too obviously accustomed to the society of boys his very dress spoke of a prolonged youth x large cat s eye circled with diamonds blazed solitary in his shirt front and his coat was cut after the manner of the contemporary reveller his chin was clean shaven and his face though a good deal worn was ripe smooth shining with good cheer and of a purply bronze hue from exposure to hot suns and familiarity with the beverages of many peoples his full red lips with their humorous corners were shaded by a small black mustache and his twinkling bistre colored eyes beneath mobile black eyebrows gave cranley the air of a jester and a good fellow in manner he was familiar with a kind of deference too and reserve like a dog that is always wagging his tail and deprecating a kick thought barton grimly as he watched the other s genial advance he s going to say good night bless him thought maitland gratefully now the others will be moving too i hope so maitland rose with much alacrity as cranley approached him to stand up would show he thought that he was not inhospitably eager to detain the parting guest good night mr maitland said the senior holding out his hand it is still early said the host doing his best to play his part must you really go yes the night s young it was about half past twelve but i have a kind of engagement to look in at the cockpit and three or four of your young friends here are anxious to come with me and see how we keep it up round there perhaps you and your friend will walk with us here he bowed slightly in the direction of barton there will be a little bac going on he continued un petit bac de sant and these boys tell me they have never played anything more elevating than loo i m afraid i am no good at a round game answered maitland who had played at his aunt s at christmas and who now observed with delight that everyone was moving but here is barton who will be happy to accompany you i daresay if you re for a frolic boys said barton quoting dr johnson and looking rather at the younger men than at cranley why i will not balk you good night maitland and he shook hands with his host good nights were uttered in every direction sticks hats and umbrellas were hunted up and while maitland half asleep was being whirled to his rooms in bloomsbury in a hansom his guests made the frozen pavement of piccadilly ring beneath their elegant heels it is only round the corner said cranley to the four or five men who accompanied him the cockpit where i am taking you is in a fashionable slum off st james s we re just there there was nothing either meretricious or sinister in the aspect of that favored resort the cockpit as the decade club was familiarly called by its friends and enemies two young merton men and the freshman from new who were enjoying their christmas vacation in town and had been dining with maitland were a little disappointed in the appearance of the place they had hoped to knock mysteriously at a back door in a lane and to be shown after investigating through a loopholed wicket into a narrow staircase which again should open on halls of light full of blazing wax candles and magnificent lacqueys while a small mysterious man would point out the secret hiding room and the passages leading on to the roof or into the next house in case of a raid by the police such was the old idea of a hell but the advance of thought has altered all these early notions the decade club was like any other small club a current of warm air charged with tobacco smoke rushed forth into the frosty night when the swinging door was opened a sleepy porter looked out of his little nest and cranley wrote the names of the companions he introduced in a book which was kept for that purpose now you are free of the cockpit for the night he said genially it s a livelier place in the small hours than that classical olympic

'InEngland204']",s wonderful that england should have produced byron it would have been wonderful if she had received any permanently deep impression from him or preserved a lasting appreciation of his work or cheerfully and intelligently recognised his immense force and accordingly we cannot help perceiving that generations are arising who know not byron this is not to say that he goes unread but there is a vast gulf fixed between the author whom we read with pleasure and even delight and that other to whom we turn at all moments for inspiration and encouragement and whose words and ideas spring up incessantly and animatingly within us unbidden whether we turn to him or no for no englishman now does byron hold this highest place and this is not unnatural in any way if we remember in what a different shape the revolution has now by change of circumstance and occasion come to present itself to those who are most ardent in the search after new paths an estimate of byron would be in some sort a measure of the distance that we have travelled within the last half century in our appreciation of the conditions of social change the modern rebel is at least half acquiescence he has developed a historic sense the most hearty aversion to the prolonged reign of some of the old gods does not hinder him from seeing that what are now frigid and unlovely blocks were full of vitality and light in days before the era of their petrifaction there is much less eagerness of praise or blame and much less faith in knife and cautery less confidence that new and right growth will naturally and necessarily follow upon demolition the revolution has never had that long hold on the national imagination in england either as an idol or a bugbear which is essential to keep the poet who sings it in effective harmony with new generations of readers more than this the byronic conception was as transitional and inadequate as the methods and ideas of the practical movers who were to a man left stranded in every country in europe during the period of his poetic activity a transitional and unstable movement of society inevitably fails to supply a propulsion powerful enough to make its poetic expression eternal there is no better proof of the enormous force of byron s genius than that it was able to produce so fine an expression of elements so intrinsically unfavourable to high poetry as doubt denial antagonism and weariness but this force was no guarantee for perpetuity of influence bare rebellion cannot endure and no succession of generations can continue nourishing themselves on the poetry of complaint and the idealisation of revolt if however it is impossible that byron should be all to us that he was to a former generation and if we find no direct guidance in his muse this is no reason why criticism should pass him over nor why there may not be something peculiarly valuable in the noble freedom and genuine modernism of his poetic spirit to an age that is apparently only forsaking the clerical idyll of one school for the reactionary medi valism or paganism intrinsically meaningless and issueless of another more attention is now paid to the mysteries of byron s life than to the merits of his work and criticism and morality are equally injured by the confusion between the worth of the verse he wrote and the virtue or wickedness of the life he lived the admirers of his poetry appear sensible of some obligation to be the champions of his conduct while those who have diligently gathered together the details of an accurate knowledge of the unseemliness of his conduct cannot bear to think that from this bramble men have been able to gather figs the result of the confusion has been that grave men and women have applied themselves to investigate and judge byron s private life as if the exact manner of it the more or less of his outrages upon decorum the degree of the deadness of his sense of moral responsibility were matter of minute and profound interest to all ages as if all this had anything to do with criticism proper it is right that we should know the life and manners of one whom we choose for a friend or of one who asks us to entrust him with the control of public interests in either of these two cases we need a guarantee for present and future art knows nothing of guarantees the work is before us its own warranty what is it to us whether turner had coarse orgies with the trulls of wapping we can judge his art without knowing or thinking of the artist and in the same way what are the stories of byron s libertinism to us they may have biographical interest but of critical interest hardly the least if the name of the author of manfred cain childe harold were already lost as it may be in remote times the work abides and its mark on european opinion je ne consid re les gens apr s leur mort said voltaire que par leurs ouvrages tout la reste est an anti pour moi there is a sense in which biographical detail gives light to criticism but not the sense in which the prurient moralist uses or seeks it the life of the poet may help to explain the growth and prominence of a characteristic sentiment or peculiar idea knowledge of this or that fact in his life may uncover the roots of something that strikes or unravel something that perplexes us considering the relations between a man s character and circumstance and what he produces we can from this point of view hardly know too much as to the personality of a great writer only let us recollect that this personality manifests itself outwardly in two separate forms in conduct and in literary production and that each of these manifestations is to be judged independently of the other if one of them is wholly censurable the other may still be the outcome of the better mind and even from the purely biographical aspect it is a plain injustice to insist on identifying a character with its worse,3

still they could move a little up and down said the medical man easier far easier down than up and you cannot move at all in time you cannot get away from the present moment my dear sir that is just where you are wrong that is just where the whole world has gone wrong we are always getting away from the present moment our mental existences which are immaterial and have no dimensions are passing along the time dimension with a uniform velocity from the cradle to the grave just as we should travel down if we began our existence fifty miles above the earth s surface but the great difficulty is this interrupted the psychologist you can move about in all directions of space but you cannot move about in time that is the germ of my great discovery but you are wrong to say that we cannot move about in time for instance if i am recalling an incident very vividly i go back to the instant of its occurrence i become absent minded as you say i jump back for a moment of course we have no means of staying back for any length of time any more than a savage or an animal has of staying six feet above the ground but a civilized man is better off than the savage in this respect he can go up against gravitation in a balloon and why should he not hope that ultimately he may be able to stop or accelerate his drift along the time dimension or even turn about and travel the other way oh this began filby is all why not said the time traveller it s against reason said filby what reason said the time traveller you can show black is white by argument said filby but you will never convince me possibly not said the time traveller but now you begin to see the object of my investigations into the geometry of four dimensions long ago i had a vague inkling of a machine to travel through time exclaimed the very young man that shall travel indifferently in any direction of space and time as the driver determines filby contented himself with laughter but i have experimental verification said the time traveller it would be remarkably convenient for the historian the psychologist suggested one might travel back and verify the accepted account of the battle of hastings for instance don t you think you would attract attention said the medical man our ancestors had no great tolerance for anachronisms one might get one s greek from the very lips of homer and plato the very young man thought in which case they would certainly plough you for the little go the german scholars have improved greek so much then there is the future said the very young man just think one might invest all one s money leave it to accumulate at interest and hurry on ahead to discover a society said i erected on a strictly communistic basis of all the wild extravagant theories began the psychologist yes so it seemed to me and so i never talked of it until experimental verification cried i you are going to verify that the experiment cried filby who was getting brain weary let s see your experiment anyhow said the psychologist though it s all humbug you know the time traveller smiled round at us then still smiling faintly and with his hands deep in his trousers pockets he walked slowly out of the room and we heard his slippers shuffling down the long passage to his laboratory the psychologist looked at us i wonder what he s got some sleight of hand trick or other said the medical man and filby tried to tell us about a conjurer he had seen at burslem but before he had finished his preface the time traveller came back and filby s anecdote collapsed the thing the time traveller held in his hand was a glittering metallic framework scarcely larger than a small clock and very delicately made there was ivory in it and some transparent crystalline substance and now i must be explicit for this that follows unless his explanation is to be accepted is an absolutely unaccountable thing he took one of the small octagonal tables that were scattered about the room and set it in front of the fire with two legs on the hearthrug on this table he placed the mechanism then he drew up a chair and sat down the only other object on the table was a small shaded lamp the bright light of which fell upon the model there were also perhaps a dozen candles about two in brass candlesticks upon the mantel and several in sconces so that the room was brilliantly illuminated i sat in a low arm chair nearest the fire and i drew this forward so as to be almost between the time traveller and the fireplace filby sat behind him looking over his shoulder the medical man and the provincial mayor watched him in profile from the right the psychologist from the left the very young man stood behind the psychologist we were all on the alert it appears incredible to me that any kind of trick however subtly conceived and however adroitly done could have been played upon us under these conditions the time traveller looked at us and then at the mechanism well said the psychologist this little affair said the time traveller resting his elbows upon the table and pressing his hands together above the apparatus is only a model it is my plan for a machine to travel through time you will notice that it looks singularly askew and that there is an odd twinkling appearance about this bar as though it was in some way unreal he pointed to the part with his finger also here is one little white lever and here is another the medical man got up out of his chair and peered into the thing it s beautifully made he said it took two years to make retorted the time traveller then when we had all imitated the action of the medical man he said now i want you,3

harris were women of sense who would judge him better than to believe for a moment that the suggestion emanated from him this little point settled the question was what sort of a change harris as usual was for the sea he said he knew a yacht just the very thing one that we could manage by ourselves no skulking lot of lubbers loafing about adding to the expense and taking away from the romance give him a handy boy he would sail it himself we knew that yacht and we told him so we had been on it with harris before it smells of bilge water and greens to the exclusion of all other scents no ordinary sea air can hope to head against it so far as sense of smell is concerned one might be spending a week in limehouse hole there is no place to get out of the rain the saloon is ten feet by four and half of that is taken up by a stove which falls to pieces when you go to light it you have to take your bath on deck and the towel blows overboard just as you step out of the tub harris and

the washing up very well then said harris let s take a proper yacht with a skipper and do the thing in style that also i objected to i know that skipper his notion of yachting is to lie in what he calls the offing where he can be well in touch with his wife and family to say nothing of his favourite public house years ago when i was young and inexperienced i hired a yacht myself three things had combined to lead me into this foolishness i had had a stroke of unexpected luck ethelbertha had expressed a yearning for sea air and the very next morning in taking up casually at the club a copy of the sportsman i had come across the following advertisement to yachtsmen unique opportunity rogue ton yawl owner called away suddenly on business is willing to let this superbly fitted greyhound of the sea for any period short or long two cabins and saloon pianette by woffenkoff new copper terms guineas a week apply pertwee and co a bucklersbury it had seemed to me like the answer to a prayer the new copper did not interest me what little washing we might want could wait i thought but the pianette by woffenkoff sounded alluring i pictured ethelbertha playing in the evening something with a chorus in which perhaps the crew with a little training might join while our moving home bounded greyhound like over the silvery billows i took a cab and drove direct to a bucklersbury mr pertwee was an unpretentious looking gentleman who had an unostentatious office on the third floor he showed me a picture in water colours of the rogue flying before the wind the deck was at an angle of to the ocean in the picture no human beings were represented on the deck i suppose they had slipped off indeed i do not see how anyone could have kept on unless nailed i pointed out this disadvantage to the agent who however explained to me that the picture represented the rogue doubling something or other on the well known occasion of her winning the medway challenge shield mr pertwee assumed that i knew all about the event so that i did not like to ask any questions two specks near the frame of the picture which at first i had taken for moths represented it appeared the second and third winners

and incomprehensible principle of human nature under the influence of which vast masses of men notwithstanding the universal instinct of aversion to control combine under certain circumstances by millions and millions to maintain for many successive centuries the representatives of some one great family in a condition of exalted and absolute and utterly irresponsible ascendency over themselves while they toil for them watch over them submit to endless and most humiliating privations in their behalf and commit if commanded to do so the most inexcusable and atrocious crimes to sustain the demigods they have thus made in their lofty estate we have in the case of this persian monarchy one of the most extraordinary exhibitions the persian monarchy appears in fact even as we look back upon it from this remote distance both of space and of time as a very vast wave of human power and grandeur it swelled up among the populations of asia between the persian gulf and the caspian sea about five hundred years before christ and rolled on in undiminished magnitude and glory for many centuries it bore upon its crest the royal line of astyages and his successors cyrus was however the first of the princes whom it held up conspicuously to the admiration of the world and he rode so gracefully and gallantly on the lofty crest that mankind have given him the credit of raising and sustaining the magnificent billow on which he was borne how far we are to consider him as founding the monarchy or the monarchy as raising and illustrating him will appear more fully in the course of this narrative cotemporaneous with this persian monarchy in the east there flourished in the west the small but very efficient and vigorous republics of greece the greeks had a written character for their language which could be easily and rapidly executed while the ordinary language of the persians was scarcely written at all there was it is true in this latter nation a certain learned character which was used by the priests for their mystic records and also for certain sacred books which constituted the only national archives it was however only slowly and with difficulty that this character could be penned and when penned it was unintelligible to the great mass of the population for this reason among others the greeks wrote narratives of the great events which occurred in their day which narratives they so embellished and adorned by the picturesque lights and shades in which their genius enabled them to present the scenes and characters described as to make them universally admired while the surrounding nations produced nothing but formal governmental records not worth to the community at large the toil and labor necessary to decipher them and make them intelligible thus the greek writers became the historians not only of their own republics but also of all the nations around them and with such admirable genius and power did they fulfill this function that while the records of all other nations cotemporary with them have been almost entirely neglected and forgotten the language of the greeks has been preserved among mankind with infinite labor and toil by successive generations of scholars in every civilized nation for two thousand years solely in order that men may continue to read these tales two greek historians have given us a narrative of the events connected with the life of cyrus herodotus and xenophon these writers disagree very materially in the statements which they make and modern readers are divided in opinion on the question which to believe in order to present this question fairly to the minds of our readers we must commence this volume with some account of these two authorities whose guidance conflicting as it is furnishes all the light which we have to follow herodotus was a philosopher and scholar xenophon was a great general the one spent his life in solitary study or in visiting various countries in the pursuit of knowledge the other distinguished himself in the command of armies and in distant military expeditions which he conducted with great energy and skill they were both by birth men of wealth and high station so that they occupied from the beginning conspicuous positions in society and as they were both energetic and enterprising in character they were led each to a very romantic and adventurous career the one in his travels the other in his campaigns so that their personal history and their exploits attracted great attention even while they lived herodotus was born in the year before christ which was about fifty years after the death of the cyrus whose history forms the subject of this volume he was born in the grecian state of caria in asia minor and in the city of halicarnassus caria as may be seen from the map at the commencement of this volume was in the southwestern part of asia minor near the shores of the x gean sea herodotus became a student at a very early age it was the custom in greece at that time to give to young men of his rank a good intellectual education in other nations the training of the young men in wealthy and powerful families was confined almost exclusively to the use of arms to horsemanship to athletic feats and other such accomplishments as would give them a manly and graceful personal bearing and enable them to excel in the various friendly contests of the public games as well as prepare them to maintain their ground against their enemies in personal combats on the field of battle the greeks without neglecting these things taught their young men also to read and to write explained to them the structure and the philosophy of language and trained them to the study of the poets the orators and the historians which their country had produced,3

this latter subject i am not here concerned the older treatises which i have consulted have been of little or no service to me the famous conferences of the painter le brun published in is the best known ancient work and contains some good remarks another somewhat old essay namely the discours delivered by the well known dutch anatomist camper can hardly be considered as having made any marked advance in the subject the following works on the contrary deserve the fullest consideration sir charles bell so illustrious for his discoveries in physiology published in the first edition and in j parsons in his paper in the appendix to the philosophical transactions for p gives a list of forty one old authors who have written on expression conferences sur l expression des differents caracteres des passions paris to i always quote from the republication of the conferences in the edition of lavater by moreau which appeared in as given in vol ix p discours par pierre camper sur le moyen de representer les diverses passions c the third edition of his anatomy and philosophy of expression he may with justice be said not only to have laid the foundations of the subject as a branch of science but to have built up a noble structure his work is in every way deeply interesting it includes graphic descriptions of the various emotions and is admirably illustrated it is generally admitted that his service consists chiefly in having shown the intimate relation which exists between the movements of expression and those of respiration one of the most important points small as it may at first appear is that the muscles round the eyes are involuntarily contracted during violent expiratory efforts in order to protect these delicate organs from the pressure of the blood this fact which has been fully investigated for me with the greatest kindness by professors donders of utrecht throws as we shall hereafter see a flood of light on several of the most important expressions of the human countenance the merits of sir c bell s work have been undervalued or quite ignored by several foreign writers but have been fully admitted by some for instance by m lemoine who with great justice says le livre de ch bell devrait etre medite par quiconque essaye de faire parler le visage de l homme par les philosophes aussi bien que par les artistes car sous une apparence plus legere et sous le pretexte de l esthetique c est un des plus beaux monuments de la science des rapports du physique et du moral i always quote from the third edition which was published after the death of sir c bell and contains his latest corrections the first edition of is much inferior in merit and does not include some of his more important views de la physionomie et de la parole par albert lemoine p from reasons which will presently be assigned sir c bell did not attempt to follow out his views as far as they might have been carried he does not try to explain why different muscles are brought into action under different emotions why for instance the inner ends of the eyebrows are raised and the corners of the mouth depressed by a person suffering from grief or anxiety in m moreau edited an edition of lavater on physiognomy in which he incorporated several of his own essays containing excellent descriptions of the movements of the facial muscles together with many valuable remarks he throws however very little light on the philosophy of the subject for instance m moreau in speaking of the act of frowning that is of the contraction of the muscle called by french writers the soucilier corrigator supercilii remarks with truth cette action des sourciliers est un des symptomes les plus tranches de l expression des affections penibles ou concentrees he then adds that these muscles from their attachment and position are fitted a resserrer a concentrer les principaux traits de la face comme il convient dans toutes ces passions vraiment oppressives ou profondes dans ces affections dont le sentiment semble porter l organisation a revenir sur elle meme a se contracter et a s amoindrir comme pour offrir moins de prise et de surface a des impressions redoutables ou

manner whatever else has happened we have all been photographed with invincible patience and resolution under the direction of colonel barberich in a sunny little court in udine my own manner of testifying must be to tell what i have seen and what i have thought during this extraordinary experience it has been my natural disposition to see this war as something purposeful and epic as it is great as an epoch as the war that will end war but of that last more anon i do not think i am alone in this inclination to a dramatic and logical interpretation the caricatures in the french shops show civilisation and particularly marianne in conflict with a huge and hugely wicked hindenburg ogre well i come back from this tour with something not so simple as that if i were to be tied down to one word for my impression of this war i should say that this war is queer it is not like anything in a really waking world but like something in a dream it hasn t exactly that clearness of light against darkness or of good against ill but it has the quality of wholesome instinct struggling under a nightmare the world is not really awake this vague appeal for explanations to all sorts of people this desire to exhibit the business to get something in the way of elucidation at present missing is extraordinarily suggestive of the efforts of the mind to wake up that will sometimes occur at a deep crisis my memory of this tour i have just made is full of puzzled looking men i have seen thousands of poilus sitting about in cafes by the roadside in tents in trenches thoughtful i have seen alpini sitting restfully and staring with speculative eyes across the mountain gulfs towards unseen and unaccountable enemies i have seen trainloads of wounded staring out of the ambulance train windows as we passed i have seen these dim intimations of questioning reflection in the strangest juxtapositions in malagasy soldiers resting for a spell among the big shells they were hoisting into trucks for the front in a couple of khaki clad maoris sitting upon the step of a horse van in amiens station it is always the same expression one catches rather weary rather sullen inturned the shoulders droop the very outline is a note of interrogation they look up as the privileged tourist of the front in the big automobile or the reserved compartment with his officer or so in charge passes importantly one meets a pair of eyes that seems to say perhaps you understand in which case it is a part i think of this disposition to investigate what makes everyone collect specimens of the war everywhere the souvenir forces itself upon the attention the homecoming permissionaire brings with him invariably a considerable weight of broken objects bits of shell cartridge clips helmets it is a peripatetic museum it is as if he hoped for a clue it is almost impossible i have found to escape these pieces in evidence i am the least collecting of men but i have brought home italian cartridges austrian cartridges the fuse of an austrian shell a broken italian bayonet and a note that is worth half a franc within the confines of amiens but a large heavy piece of exploded shell that had been thrust very urgently upon my attention upon the carso i contrived to lose during the temporary confusion of our party by the arrival and explosion of another prospective souvenir in our close proximity and two really very large and almost complete specimens of some species of ammonites unknown to me from the hills to the east of the adige partially wrapped in a back number of the corriere della sera that were pressed upon me by a friendly officer were unfortunately lost on the line between verona and milan through the gross negligence of a railway porter but i doubt if they would have thrown any very conclusive light upon the war i avow myself an extreme pacifist i am against the man who first takes up the weapon i carry my pacifism far beyond the ambiguous little group of british and foreign sentimentalists who pretend so amusingly to be socialists in the labour leader whose conception of foreign policy is to give germany now a peace that would be no more than a breathing time for a fresh outrage upon civilisation and who would even make heroes of the crazy young assassins of the dublin crime i do not understand those people i do not merely want to stop this war i want to nail down war in its coffin modern war is an intolerable thing it is not a thing to trifle with in this urban district council way it is a thing to end forever i have always hated it so far that is as my imagination enabled me to realise it and now that i have been seeing it sometimes quite closely for a full month i hate it more than ever i never imagined a quarter of its waste its boredom its futility its desolation it is merely a destructive and dispersive instead of a constructive and accumulative industrialism it is a gigantic dusty muddy weedy bloodstained silliness it is the plain duty of every man to give his life and all that he has if by so doing he may help to end it i hate germany which has thrust this experience upon mankind as i hate some horrible infectious disease the

hard green rock was left after the glaciers were gone the ohio climate was still very cold and vast lakes stretched over the state freezing in the long winters and thawing in the short summers one of these spread upward from the neighborhood of akron to the east and west of where cleveland stands but by far the largest flooded nearly all that part of ohio which the glaciers failed to cover from beyond where pittsburg is to where cincinnati is at the last point a mighty ice dam formed every winter till as the climate grew warmer and the ice thawed more and more the waters burst the dam and poured their tide down the ohio river to the mississippi while those of the northern lake rushed through the cuyahoga to lake erie and both lakes disappeared forever for the next four or five thousand years the early ohio men kept very quiet but we need not suppose for that reason that there were none our ice folk who dropped their stone axes in the river banks may have passed away with the ice age or they may have remained in ohio and begun slowly to take on some faint likeness of civilization there is nothing to prove that they went and there is nothing to prove that they staid but ohio must always have been a pleasant place to live in after the great thaw and it seems reasonable to think that the ice folk lingered in part at least and changed with the changing climate and became at last the people who left the signs of their presence in almost every part of the state those were the mound builders whose works are said to be two or three thousand years old though we cannot be very sure of that there are some who think that the mounds are only a few hundred years old and that their builders were the race of red men whom the white men found here one may think very much as one likes and i like to think that the mound builders were a very ancient people who vanished many ages before the indians came here they could not have been savages for the region where they dwelt could not have fed savages enough to heap up the multitude of their mounds each wild man needs fifty thousand acres to live upon as the wild man lives by hunting and fishing in the whole ohio country the earliest white adventurers found only two or three thousand indians at the most and the people who built those forts and temples and tombs and shaped from the earth the mighty images of their strange bird gods and reptile gods could have lived only by tilling the soil their mounds are found everywhere in the west between the alleghany mountains and the mississippi river but they are found mostly in ohio where their farms and gardens once bordered the muskingum the scioto the two miamis and our other large streams which they probably used as highways to the rivers of the southwest their forts were earthworks but they were skillfully planned with a knowledge which no savage race has shown they were real strongholds and they are so large that some of them inclose hundreds of acres within walls of earth which still rise ten and twelve feet from the ground they are on a far grander scale than the supposed temples or religious works and there are more of them than of all the other ruins except the small detached mounds which are almost numberless these from the charred bones found among the ashes in them are known to be tombs and they were probably the sepulchers of the common people whose bodies were burned the large mounds are heaped above walled chambers and in these were platforms supposed to have been altars and whole skeletons supposed to be the skeletons of priests buried there the priests are supposed to have been the chiefs of the people and to have ruled them through their superstitions but there is nothing to prove this for their laws were never put in written words or any other sign of speech in some of the mounds little figures of burnt clay have been found which may be idols and pieces of ancient pottery which may be fragments of sacred vessels and small plates of copper with marks or scratches on them which may be letters some antiquarians have tried to read these letters if they are letters and to make sense out of them but no seeker after true ohio stories can trust their interpretations the mound builders used very little stone and showed no knowledge of masonry but they built so massively out of the earth that their works have lasted to this day in many places just as they left them except for the heavy growth of trees which the first settlers found covering them and which were sometimes seven or eight hundred years old at marietta these works when the white people came were quite perfect and inclosed fifty acres on the bank of the muskingum overlooking the ohio they were in great variety of design the largest mound was included in the grounds of the present cemetery and so has been saved but the plow of the new england emigrant soon passed over the foundations of the mound builders temples at circleville the shape of their fortifications gave its name to the town which has long since hid them from sight one of them was almost perfectly round and the other nearly square the round fort was about seventy feet in diameter and was formed of two walls twenty feet high with a deep ditch between the other fort was fifty five rods square and it had no ditch seven gateways opened into it at the side and corners and it was joined to the round fort by an eighth it is forever to be regretted that these precious ancient works should have been destroyed to make place for the present town but within a few years one of the most marvelous of the mound builders works the great serpent mound near loudon in adams county has been preserved to after time by the friends of science and put in the keeping of the peabody museum

whose labours and some of the most remarkable of turgot s there was so much community we cannot tell how far the gulf between turgot and the earlier band was fixed by the accident that he did not belong to their generation in point of time the accident is in itself only worth calling attention to in connection with his distance from them in other and more important points than time footnote born in and respectively the years of turgot exactly bridge the interval between the ministry of the infamous dubois and the ministry of the inglorious calonne between the despair and confusion of the close of the regency and the despair and confusion of the last ten years of the monarchy in we stand on the threshold of that far resounding fiery workshop where a hundred hands wrought the cunning implements and cyclopean engines that were to serve in storming the hated citadels of superstition and injustice in we emerge from these subterranean realms into the open air to find ourselves surrounded by all the sounds and portents of imminent ruin this then is the significance of the date of turgot s birth his stock was norman and those who amuse themselves by finding a vital condition of the highest ability in antiquity of blood may quote the descent of turgot in support of their delusion his biographers speak of one togut a danish prince who walked the earth some thousand years before the christian era and of saint turgot in the eleventh century the prior of durham biographer of bede and first minister of malcolm iii of scotland we shall do well not to linger in this too dark and frigid air let us pass over togut and saint turgot and the founder of a hospital in the thirteenth century and the great great grandfather who sat as president of the norman nobles in the states general of and the grandfather who deserted arms for the toga history is hardly concerned in this solemn marshalling of shades even with michel etienne the father of turgot we have here no dealing let it suffice to say that he held high municipal office in paris and performed its duties with exceptional honour and spirit giving sumptuous f tes constructing useful public works and on one occasion jeoparding his life with a fine intrepidity that did not fail in his son in appeasing a bloody struggle between two bodies of swiss and french guards there is in the library of the british museum a folio of containing elaborate plates and letterpress descriptive of the f tes celebrated by the city of paris with michel etienne turgot as its chief officer on the occasion of the marriage of louise elizabeth of france to don philip of spain august as one contemplates these courtly sumptuosities la bruy re s famous picture recurs to the mind of far other scenes in the same gay land we see certain wild animals male and female scattered over the fields black livid all burnt by the sun bound to the earth that they dig and work with unconquerable pertinacity they have a sort of articulate voice and when they rise on their feet they show a human face in fact they are men that these violent and humiliating contrasts are eternal and inevitable is the last word of the dominant philosophy of society and one of the reasons why turgot s life is worth studying is that he felt in so pre eminent a degree the urgency of lightening the destiny of that livid wild hardly articulate ever toiling multitude the sum of the genealogical page is that turgot inherited that position which falling to worthy souls is of its nature so invaluable a family tradition of exalted courage and generous public spirit there have been noble and patriotic men who lacked this inheritance but we may be sure that even these would have fought the battle at greater advantage if a magnanimous preference for the larger interests had come to them as a matter of instinctive prejudice instead of being acquired as a matter of reason the question of titular aristocracy is not touched by this consideration for titular aristocracies postpone the larger interests to the narrow interests of their order and turgot s family was only of the secondary noblesse of the robe turgot was the third son of his father as the employments which persons of respectable family could enter were definite and stereotyped there was little room for debate as to the calling for which a youth should prepare himself arms civil administration and the church furnished the only three openings for a gentleman the effects of this rigorous adherence to artificial and exclusive rules of caste were manifestly injurious to society as such caste rules always are after a society has passed beyond a certain stage to identify the interests of the richest and most powerful class with the interests of the church of the army and of a given system of civil government was indeed to give to that class the strongest motives for leaving the existing social order undisturbed it unfortunately went too far in this direction by fostering the strongest possible motives of hostility to such modifications in these gigantic departments as changing circumstances might make needful in the breasts of the only men who could produce these modifications without a violent organic revolution such a system left too little course to spontaneity and its curse is the curse of french genius some of its evil effects were

sloven dejection with the brisk neatness of the service at st johnswort but through all he never lost the awe the sense of responsibility which he bore to the vision vouchsafed him doubtless for some reason and to some end that it behooved him to divine he found a yesterday s paper in the office of the hotel and read it till he began to drowse over it when he pulled himself up with a sharp jerk he discovered that it was now six o clock and he thought if he could walk about for an hour he might return to st johnswort and worry through the remaining hour till breakfast somehow he was still framing in his thoughts some sort of statement concerning the apparition which he should make when the largest number of guests had got together at the table with a fine question whether he should take them between the cantaloupe and the broiled chicken or wait till they had come to the corn griddle cakes which st john s cook served of a filigree perfection in homage to the good old american breakfast ideal there would be more women if he waited and he should need the sympathy and countenance of women his story would be wanting in something of its supreme effect without the electrical response of their keener nerves ii when hewson came up to the cottage he was sensible of a certain agitation in the air which was intensified to him by the sight of st john in his bare bald head and the n glig of a flannel housecoat inspecting with the gardener and one of the grooms the fallen trellis under the library window which from time to time they looked up at as they talked hewson made haste to join them through the garden gate and to say shamefacedly enough oh i m afraid i m responsible for that and he told how he must have thrown down the trellis in getting out of the window oh said st john while the two men walked away with dissatisfied grins at being foiled of their sensation we thought it was burglars i m so glad it was only you but in spite of his profession st john did not give hewson any very lively proof of his enjoyment deuced uncomfortable to have had one s guests murdered in their beds don t say anything about it please hewson the women would all fly the premises if there d been even a suspicion of burglars oh no i won t hewson willingly assented but he perceived a disappointment in st john s tone and manner and he suspected him however unjustly of having meant to give himself importance with his guests by the rumor of a burglary in the house he was a man quite capable of that hewson believed and failing it capable of pretending that he wanted the matter hushed up in the interest of others in any case he saw that it was not to st john primarily or secondarily to st john s guests that he could celebrate the fact of his apparition in the presence of st john s potential vulgarity he keenly felt his own and he recoiled from what he had imagined doing he even realized that he would have been working st john an injury by betraying his house to his guests as the scene of a supernatural incident nobody believes in ghosts but there is not one in a thousand of us who would not be uncomfortable in a haunted house or a house so reputed if hewson told what he had seen he would not only scatter st john s house party to the four winds but he would cast such a blight upon st johnswort that it would never sell for a tenth of its cost iii from that instant hewson renounced his purpose and he remained true to this renunciation in spite of the behavior of st john which might well have tempted him to a revenge in kind no one seemed to have slept late that morning several of the ladies complained that they had not slept a wink the whole night and two or three of the men owned to having waked early and not been able to hit it off again in a morning nap though it appeared that they were adepts in that sort of thing the hour of their vigils corresponded so nearly with that of hewson s apparition that he wondered if a mystical influence from it had not penetrated the whole house the adventitious facts were of such a nature that he controlled with the greater difficulty the wish to explode upon an audience so aptly prepared for it the prodigious incident which he was keeping in reserve but he did not yield even when st john carefully led up to the point through the sensation of his guests by recounting the evidences of the supposed visit of a burglar and then made his effect by suddenly turning upon hewson and saying with his broad guffaw and here you have the burglar in person he has owned his crime to me and i ve let him off the penalty on cond,3

and comfortable he put his arm round her waist and squeezed her hand and aided by this moral support miss harris not only consented to remain but found various advantages in the forecastle over the

herself in the glass waved the amorous ted on deck and started work on her disarranged hair at breakfast time a little friction was caused by what the mate bitterly termed the narrow minded old

hurried meal to find the skipper narrating some of his choicest experiences to an audience which hung on his lightest word the disregard they showed for his feelings was maddening and for the first time in his life he became a prey to jealousy in its worst form it was quite clear to him that the girl had become desperately enamoured of the skipper and he racked his brain in a wild effort to discover the reason with an idea of reminding his brother in law of his position he alluded two or three times in a casual fashion to his wife the skipper hardly listened to him and patting miss harris x x s cheek in a fatherly manner regaled her with an anecdote of the mate x x s boyhood which the latter had spent a goodly portion of his life in denying he denied it again hotly and miss

he looked at his watch again and straightway holding his reins firmly for the horses were still pawing the ground restlessly and shaking their heads he climbed to his box as though the time had come for proceeding on our journey i felt a little obstinate and did not at once get into the carriage tell me i said about this place where the road leads and i pointed down again he crossed himself and mumbled a prayer before he answered it is unholy what is unholy i enquired the village then there is a village no no no one lives there hundreds of years my curiosity was piqued but you said there was a village there was where is it now whereupon he burst out into a long story in german and english so mixed up that i could not quite understand exactly what he said but roughly i gathered that long ago hundreds of years men had died there and been buried in their graves and sounds were heard under the clay and when the graves were opened men and women were found rosy with life and their mouths red with blood and so in haste to save their lives aye and their souls and here he crossed himself those who were left fled away to other places where the living lived and the dead were dead and not not something he was evidently afraid to speak the last words as he proceeded with his narration he grew more and more excited it seemed as if his imagination had got hold of him and he ended in a perfect paroxysm of fear white faced perspiring trembling and looking round him as if expecting that some dreadful presence would manifest itself there in the bright sunshine on the open plain finally in an agony of desperation he cried walpurgis nacht and pointed to the carriage for me to get in all my english blood rose at this and standing back i said you are afraid johann you are afraid go home i shall return alone the walk will do me good the carriage door was open i took from the seat my oak walking stick which i always carry on my holiday excursions and closed the door pointing back to munich and said go home johann walpurgis nacht doesn t concern englishmen the horses were now more restive than ever and johann was trying to hold them in while excitedly imploring me not to do anything so foolish i pitied the poor fellow he was deeply in earnest but all the same i could not help laughing his english was quite gone now in his anxiety he had forgotten that his only means of making me understand was to talk my language so he jabbered away in his native german it began to be a little tedious after giving the direction home i turned to go down the cross road into the valley with a despairing gesture johann turned his horses towards munich i leaned on my stick and looked after him he went slowly along the road for a while then there came over the crest of the hill a man tall and thin i could see so much in the distance when he drew near the horses they began to jump and kick about then to scream with terror johann could not hold them in they bolted down the road running away madly i watched them out of sight then looked for the stranger but i found that he too was gone with a light heart i turned down the side road through the deepening valley to which johann had objected there was not the slightest reason that i could see for his objection and i daresay i tramped for a couple of hours without thinking of time or distance and certainly without seeing a person or a house so far as the place was concerned it was desolation itself but i did not notice this particularly till on turning a bend in the road i came upon a scattered fringe of wood then i recognised that i had been impressed unconsciously by the desolation of the region through which i had passed i sat down to rest myself and began to look around it struck me that it was considerably colder than it had been at the commencement of my walk a sort of sighing sound seemed to be around me with now and then high overhead a sort of muffled roar looking upwards i noticed that great thick clouds were drifting rapidly across the sky from north to south at a great height there were signs of coming storm in some lofty stratum of the air i was a little chilly and thinking that it was the sitting still after the exercise of walking i resumed my journey the ground i passed over was now much more picturesque there were no striking objects that the eye might single out but in all there was a charm of beauty i took little heed of time and it was only when the deepening twilight forced itself upon me that i began to think of how i should find my way home the brightness of the day had gone the air was cold and the drifting of clouds high overhead was more marked they were accompanied by a sort of far away rushing sound through which seemed to come at intervals that mysterious cry which the driver had said came from a wolf for a while i hesitated i had said i would see the deserted village so on i went and presently came on a wide stretch of open country shut in by hills all around their sides were covered with trees which spread down to the plain dotting in clumps the gentler slopes and hollows which showed here and there i followed with my eye the winding of the road and saw that it curved close to one of the densest of these clumps and was lost behind it as i looked there came a cold shiver in the air and the snow began to fall i thought of the miles and miles of bleak country i had passed and then hurried on to seek the shelter of the wood in front darker and darker grew the sky and faster and heavier fell the snow till the earth before and around me was a glistening white carpet the further edge of which was lost in misty vagueness the road was here but crude and when on the level its boundaries were not so marked as when it passed through the cuttings

dear old briar patch yes sir that s the only thing that s wrong with me i m just tired of myself and that s why i ve lost my appetite and now i know what s the matter what am i going to do about it if i were sure absolutely sure that old man coyote meant what he said about our being friends i d start out this very minute to call on all my old friends my my my it seems an age since i visited the smiling pool and saw grandfather frog and jerry muskrat and billy mink and little joe otter mr coyote sounded as if he really meant to leave me alone but but well perhaps he did mean it when he saw me sitting here safe among the brambles but if i should meet him out in the open he might change his mind and oh dear his teeth are terrible long and sharp peter sat a little longer thinking and thinking then a bright idea popped into his head he kicked up his heels i ll do it said he i ll make a journey that s what i ll do i ll make a journey and see the great world by staying here and sitting still i m sure i ll simply grow quite ill a change of scene is what i need to be from all my trouble freed of course if peter had really stopped to think the matter over thoroughly he would have known that running away from one kind of trouble is almost sure to lead to other troubles but peter is one of those who does his thinking afterward peter is what is called impulsive that is he does things and then thinks about them later and often wishes he hadn t done them so now the minute the idea of making a journey popped into his head he made up his mind that he would do it and that was all there was to it you see peter never looks ahead if he could get rid of the trouble that bothered him now which you know was nothing but lonesomeness he wouldn t worry about the troubles he might get into later now the minute peter made up his mind to make a journey he began to feel better his lost appetite returned and the first thing he did was to eat a good meal of sweet clover let me see said he as he filled his big stomach i believe i ll visit the old pasture it s a long way off and i ve never been there but i ve heard sammy jay say that it s a very wonderful place and i don t believe it is any more dangerous than the green meadows and the green forest now that old man coyote and reddy and granny fox are all living here i ll start tonight when i am sure that old man coyote is nowhere around and i won t tell a soul where i am going so peter settled himself and tried to sleep the long day away but his mind was so full of the long journey he was going to make that he couldn t sleep much and when he did have a nap he dreamed of wonderful sights and adventures out in the great world at last he saw jolly round red mr sun drop down to his bed behind the purple hills old mother west wind came hurrying back from her day s work and gathered her children the merry little breezes into her big bag and then she too started for her home behind the purple hills a little star came out and winked at peter and then way over on the edge of the green forest he heard old man coyote laugh peter grinned that was what he had been waiting for since it meant that old man coyote was so far away that there was nothing to fear from him peter hopped out from the dear safe old briar patch looked this way and that way and then with his heart in his mouth started towards the old pasture as fast as he could go lipperty lipperty lip chapter iii hooty the owl changes his hunting grounds a full stomach makes a pleasant day an empty stomach turns the whole world gray peter rabbit hooty the owl sat on the tip top of a tall dead tree in the green forest while the black shadows crept swiftly among the trees he was talking to himself it wouldn t have done for him to have spoken aloud what he was saying to himself for then the little people in feathers and fur on whom he likes to make his dinner would have heard him and known just where he was so he said it to himself and sat so still that he looked for all the world like a part of the tree on which he was sitting what he was saying was this towhit towhoo towhit towhoo will some one tell me what to do my children have an appetite that keeps me hunting all the night and though their stomachs i may stuff they never seem to have enough towhit towhoo towhit towhoo will some one tell me what to do when it was dark enough he gave his fierce hunting call whooo hoo hoo whoo hoo now that is a terrible sound in the dark woods very terrible indeed to the little forest people because it sounds so fierce and hungry it makes them jump and shiver and that is just what hooty wants them to do for in doing it one of them is likely to make just the least scratching with his claws or to rustle a leaf if he does hooty whose ears are very very wonderful is almost sure to hear and with his great yellow eyes see him and then hooty has his dinner the very night when peter rabbit started on his journey to the old pasture hooty the owl had made up his mind that something had got to be done to get more food for those hungry babies of his up in the big hemlock tree in the darkest corner of the green forest hunting was very poor very poor indeed and hooty was at his wits end to know what he should do he had hooted and hooted in vain in the green forest and he had sailed back and forth over the green meadows like a great black shadow without seeing so much as a single mouse it s all because of old man coyote and granny and reddy fox said hooty angrily they ve spoiled the hunting yes sir that s just what they have done if i expect to feed those hungry babies of mine i must find new hunting,4

candle with his hand led the way forward to the foot of the stairs shut the door somebody he said there s too much draught it is shut said white glancing behind him meagle fingered his chin who shut it he inquired looking from one to the other who came in last i did said lester but i don t remember shutting it perhaps i did though meagle about to speak thought better of it and still carefully guarding the flame began to explore the house with the others close behind shadows danced on the walls and lurked in the corners as they proceeded at the end of the passage they found a second staircase and ascending it slowly gained the first floor careful said meagle as they gained the landing he held the candle forward and showed where the balusters had broken away then he peered curiously into the void beneath this is where the tramp hanged himself i suppose he said thoughtfully you ve got an unwholesome mind said white as they walked on this place is qutie creepy enough without your remembering that now let s find a comfortable room and have a little nip of whiskey apiece and a pipe how will this do he opened a door at the end of the passage and revealed a small square room meagle led the way with the candle and first melting a drop or two of tallow stuck it on the mantelpiece the others seated themselves on the floor and watched pleasantly as white drew from his pocket a small bottle of whiskey and a tin cup h m i ve forgotten the water he exclaimed i ll soon get some said meagle he tugged violently at the bell handle and the rusty jangling of a bell sounded from a distant kitchen he rang again don t play the fool said barnes roughly meagle laughed i only wanted to convince you he said kindly there ought to be at any rate one ghost in the servants hall barnes held up his hand for silence yes said meagle with a grin at the other two is anybody coming suppose we drop this game and go back said barnes suddenly i don t believe in spirits but nerves are outside anybody s command you may laugh as you like but it really seemed to me that i heard a door open below and steps on the stairs his voice was drowned in a roar of laughter he is coming round said meagle with a smirk by the time i have done with him he will be a confirmed believer well who will go and get some water will you barnes no was the reply if there is any it might not be safe to drink after all these years said lester we must do without it meagle nodded and taking a seat on the floor held out his hand for the cup pipes were lit and the clean wholesome smell of tobacco filled the room white produced a pack of cards talk and laughter rang through the room and died away reluctantly in distant corridors empty rooms always delude me into the belief that i possess a deep voice said meagle to morrow he started up with a smothered exclamation as the light went out suddenly and something struck him on the head the others sprang to their feet then meagle laughed it s the candle he exclaimed i didn t stick it enough barnes struck a match and relighting the candle stuck it on the mantelpiece and sitting down took up his cards again what was i going to say said meagle oh i know to morrow i listen said white laying his hand on the other s sleeve upon my word i really thought i heard a laugh look here said barnes what do you say to going back i ve had enough of this i keep fancying that i hear things too sounds of something moving about in the passage outside i know it s only fancy but it s uncomfortable you go if you want to said meagle and we will play dummy or you might ask the tramp to take your hand for you as you go downstairs barnes shivered and exclaimed angrily he got up and walking to the half closed door listened go outside said meagle winking at the other two i ll dare you to go down to the hall door and back by yourself barnes came back and bending forward lit his pipe at the candle i am nervous but rational he said blowing out a thin cloud of smoke my nerves tell me that there is something prowling up and down the long passage outside my reason tells me that it is all nonsense where are my cards he sat down again and taking up his hand looked through it carefully and led your play white he said after a pause white made no sign why he is asleep said meagle wake up old man wake up and play lester who was sitting next to him took the sleeping man by the arm and shook him gently at first and then with some roughness but white with his back against the wall and his head bowed made no sign meagle bawled in his ear and then turned a puzzled face to the others he sleeps like the dead he said grimacing well there are still three of us to keep each other company yes said lester nodding unless good lord suppose he broke off and eyed

of hinting that they understood one another and osborn vaguely suspected that he worked upon his prejudices but he was a sportsman he had pluck and knew what the osborn traditions demanded in fact gerald might go far if he went straight then osborn thought he needed a drink and after ringing a bell he sat down by the window with the tray and glass a servant brought it was significant that he had given no order the servants knew what the bell meant when he had drained the glass he vacantly looked out boggy pasture and stony cornfields ran back from the tarn here and there a white farmstead surrounded by stunted trees stood at the hill foot farther back a waterfall seamed the rocks and yellow grass with threads of foam and then a lofty moor red with heather shut off the view the land was poor at the dale head but there was better below where the hills dropped down to the flat country and with the exception of ashness farm all was osborn s from force crag where the beck plunged from the moor to the rich bottoms round allerby mill unfortunately the estate was encumbered when he inherited it and he had paid off one mortgage by raising another he might perhaps have used other means letting his sporting rights and using economy but this would have jarred the only osborn who bothered about money was his wife and alice was parsimonious enough for both money was certainly what his agent called tight but as long as he could give his friends some shooting and a good dinner and live as an osborn ought to live he was satisfied still gerald must have his chance at woolwich and this needed thought osborn felt he would like another drink but glanced at his watch and saw that his visitors would arrive in a few minutes they were punctual and osborn got up when his agent and another man came in hayes was tall urbane and dressed with rather fastidious neatness bell was round shouldered and shabby he had a weather beaten skin gray hair and small cunning eyes osborn indicated chairs and sat down at the top of the big table he disliked business and knew the others meant to persuade him to do something he would sooner leave alone this would have been impossible had he not needed money mr bell wishes to know if his tender for the slate company s haulage is approved hayes began his traction engine is suited for the work and he is prepared to buy a trailer lurry which we would find useful in the dale mechanical transport would be a public advantage on our hilly roads it needs a good horse to bring half a load from station bell interposed t lurry would move as much in yan day as farmers carts in four osborn agreed he was not much of an economist but it was obvious that time and labor were wasted when a farmer took a few sacks of potatoes to the railway and another a sack of wool there was no difficulty about the tender because osborn was chairman of the small slate company the trouble was that the contract would help bell to carry out another plan the fellow was greedy and was getting a rather dangerous control he had already a lease of the limekilns and allerby mill but his rents were regularly paid and it was an advantage to deal with one prosperous tenant instead of several who had not his punctuality and capital the trailer would be useful if you decided to make the new terrace you thought about hayes suggested the cost of carting the gravel and the slabs for the wall would be heavy but i have no doubt mr bell would undertake the work with the trailer on very reasonable terms i might forget to send in t bill yan good turn deserves another bell remarked hayes frowned he had meant to imply something like this but bell was too blunt for all that osborn was not very fastidious and had long meant to make the terrace when funds permitted in fact he hardly saw the thing as a bribe it was rather a graceful recognition of his authority very well he said i ll sign the contract there is another matter hayes resumed mr bell is willing to take up harkness tenancy of the coal yard and seed store at the station he hopes you will grant him a long lease osborn pondered harkness had been drunken careless and often behind with his rent he had let his business fall away and it was understood that bell who managed the opposition coal yard had lent him small sums and until recently kept him on his feet this was not because bell was charitable but because if harkness came down while he had any trade left a capable rival might take his place in the meantime his customers gradually went to bell and now harkness had failed there was no business to attract a newcomer i don t know said osborn i had thought of advertising the yard and store you ll get nobody to pay what i m offering bell replied a stranger would want to see harkness books and there s nowt in them as would tempt him to pay a decent rent then with trailer going back from station i could beat him on the haulage up the dale he d niver get his money back if he bowt an engine like mine this was plausible but osborn hesitated he saw that bell wanted a monopoly and had a vague notion that he ought to protect his tenants it s sometimes an advantage to have two traders in a place he remarked a certain amount of competition is healthy i don t know if it would be an advantage to the estate and imagine you would not get a tenant to pay what bell offers hayes replied besides rival traders sometimes agree to keep up prices and competition does not always make things cheap that s one of the ridiculous arguments people who want the government to manage everything sometimes use said osborn with a scorn,4

for a train she must have or the whole thing would be an utter failure a little sacque was eked out however and when the frills were on it was ravishing as kitty said with a sigh of mingled delight and fatigue the gored skirt was a fearful job as any one who has ever plunged into the mysteries will testify and before the facing even experienced pris quailed the bonnet also was a trial for when the lace was on it was discovered that the ribbons didn t match the dress here was a catastrophe kitty frantically rummaged the house the shops the stores of her friends and rummaged in vain there was no time to send to the city and despair was about to fall on kitty when pris rescued her by quietly making one of the small sacrifices which were easy to her because her life was spent for others some one suggested a strip of blue illusion and that could be got but alas kitty had no money for the gloves were already bought pris heard the lamentations and giving up fresh ribbons for herself pulled her sister out of a slough of despond with two yards of heavenly tulle now the daisies and oh dear me not one can i find in this poverty stricken town sighed kitty prinking at the glass and fervently hoping that nothing would happen to her complexion over night i see plenty just like those on your dress answered pris nodding toward the meadow full of young whiteweed pris you re a treasure i ll wear real ones they keep well i know and are so common i can refresh my bonnet anywhere it s a splendid idea away rushed kitty to return with an apron full of american daisies a pretty cluster was soon fastened just over the left hand frizzle of bright hair and the little bonnet was complete now pris tell me how i look cried kitty as she swept into the room late that afternoon in full gala costume it would have been impossible for the primmest the sourest or the most sensible creature in the world to say that it wasn t a pretty sight the long train the big chignon the apology for a bonnet were all ridiculous no one could deny that but youth beauty and a happy heart made even those absurdities charming the erect young figure gave an air to the crisp folds of the delicate dress the bright eyes and fresh cheeks under the lace rosette made one forget its size and the rippling brown hair won admiration in spite of the ugly bunch which disfigured the girl s head the little jacket set divinely the new gloves were as immaculate as white kids could be and to crown all lizzie king in a burst of generosity lent kitty the blue and white paris sunshade which she couldn t use herself now i could die content i m perfect in all respects and i know jack won t be ashamed of me i really owe it to him to look my best you know and that s why i m so particular said kitty in an apologetic tone as she began to lay away her finery i hope you will enjoy every minute of the time deary don t forget to finish running up the facing i ve basted it carefully and would do it if my head didn t ache so i really can t hold it up any longer answered pris who had worked like a disinterested bee while kitty had flown about like a distracted butterfly go and lie down you dear kind soul and don t think of my nonsense again said kitty feeling remorseful till pris was comfortably asleep when she went to her room and revelled in her finery till bedtime so absorbed was she in learning to manage her train gracefully that she forgot the facing till very late then being worn out with work and worry she did what girls are too apt to do stuck a pin here and there and trusting to priscilla s careful bastings left it as it was retiring to dream of a certain horace fletcher whose aristocratic elegance had made a deep impression upon her during the few evenings she had seen him nothing could have been lovelier than the morning and few hearts happier than kitty s as she arrayed herself with the utmost care and waited in solemn state for the carriage for muslin trains and dewy roads were incompatible and one luxury brought another my goodness where did she get that stylish suit whispered miss smith to miss jones as kitty floated into the station with all sail set finding it impossible to resist the temptation to astonish certain young ladies who had snubbed her in times past which snubs had rankled and were now avenged i looked everywhere for a muslin for to day and couldn t find any i liked so i was forced to wear my mauve silk observed miss smith complacently settling the silvery folds of her dress it s very pretty but one ruins a silk at class day you know i thought this organdie would be more comfortable and appropriate this warm day a friend brought it from paris and it s like one the princess of wales wore at the great flower show this year returned kitty with the air of a young lady who had all her dresses from paris and was intimately acquainted with the royal family those girls were entirely extinguished by this stroke and hadn t a word to say for themselves while kitty casually mentioned horace fletcher lyceum hall and cousin jack for they had only a little freshman brother to boast of and were not going to lyceum hall as she stepped out of the cars at cambridge jack opened his honest blue eyes and indulged in a low whistle of astonishment for if there was anything he especially hated it was the trains chignons and tiny

is far from general and is not remarkable for as i have elsewhere attempted to show variations arising early in life have often been accumulated through sexual selection being then commonly transmitted to both sexes on the other hand variations arising late in life cannot fail to coincide approximately in period with that of the process of sexual selection allusions to these erroneous

travelled in coolies whatever they may be now my dear fellow do you know what kind of man your guest is or don t you he seems to be a military and sporting kind of gent so to speak said maitland but what does it matter then you don t know why he left his private tutor s you don t know why he left the university you don t know why he left the ninety second you don t know and no one does what he did after that and you never heard of that affair with the frenchman in egypt well maitland replied about his ancient history i own i don t know anything as to the row with the frenchman at cairo he told me himself he said the beggar was too small for him to lick and that duelling was ridiculous they didn t take that view of it at shephard s hotel well it is not my affair said maitland one should see all sort of characters bielby says this is not an ordinary fellow why he has been a sailor before the mast he says by way of adventure and he is full of good stories i rather like him and he can t do my moral character any harm i m not likely to deal in coolies at my time of life nor quarrel with warlike aliens no but he s not a good man to introduce to these boys from oxford barton was saying when the subject of their conversation came up surrounded by his little court of undergraduates the hon thomas cranley was a good deal older than the company in which he found himself without being one of the hoary youths who play falstaff to every fresh heir s prince harry he was a middle aged man too obviously accustomed to the society of boys his very dress spoke of a prolonged youth x large cat s eye circled with diamonds blazed solitary in his shirt front and his coat was cut after the manner of the contemporary reveller his chin was clean shaven and his face though a good deal worn was ripe smooth shining with good cheer and of a purply bronze hue from exposure to hot suns and familiarity with the beverages of many peoples his full red lips with their humorous corners were shaded by a small black mustache and his twinkling bistre colored eyes beneath mobile black eyebrows gave cranley the air of a jester and a good fellow in manner he was familiar with a kind of deference too and reserve like a dog that is always wagging his tail and deprecating a kick thought barton grimly as he watched the other s genial advance he s going to say good night bless him thought maitland gratefully now the others will be moving too i hope so maitland rose with much alacrity as cranley approached him to stand up would show he thought that he was not inhospitably eager to detain the parting guest good night mr maitland said the senior holding out his hand it is still early said the host doing his best to play his part must you really go yes the night s young it was about half past twelve but i have a kind of engagement to look in at the cockpit and three or four of your young friends here are anxious to come with me and see how we keep it up round there perhaps you and your friend will walk with us here he bowed slightly in the direction of barton there will be a little bac going on he continued un petit bac de sant and these boys tell me they have never played anything more elevating than loo i m afraid i am no good at a round game answered maitland who had played at his aunt s at christmas and who now observed with delight that everyone was moving but here is barton who will be happy to accompany you i daresay if you re for a frolic boys said barton quoting dr johnson and looking rather at the younger men than at cranley why i will not balk you good night maitland and he shook hands with his host good nights were uttered in every direction sticks hats and umbrellas were hunted up and while maitland half asleep was being whirled to his rooms in bloomsbury in a hansom his guests made the frozen pavement of piccadilly ring beneath their elegant heels it is only round the corner said cranley to the four or five men who accompanied him the cockpit where i am taking you is in a fashionable slum off st james s we re just there there was nothing either meretricious or sinister in the aspect of that favored resort the cockpit as the decade club was familiarly called by its friends and enemies two young merton men and the freshman from new who were enjoying their christmas vacation in town and had been dining with maitland were a little disappointed in the appearance of the place they had hoped to knock mysteriously at a back door in a lane and to be shown after investigating through a loopholed wicket into a narrow staircase which again should open on halls of light full of blazing wax candles and magnificent lacqueys while a small mysterious man would point out the secret hiding room and the passages leading on to the roof or into the next house in case of a raid by the police such was the old idea of a hell but the advance of thought has altered all these early notions the decade club was like any other small club a current of warm air charged with tobacco smoke rushed forth into the frosty night when the swinging door was opened a sleepy porter looked out of his little nest and cranley wrote the names of the companions he introduced in a book which was kept for that purpose now you are free of the cockpit for the night he said genially it s a livelier place in the small hours than that classical olympic

the first finger into the oil ow cried arnold jumping don t let him see he s hurting you whispered werner stauffacher pretend you don t notice it gessler leaned forward again have your views on taxes changed at all he asked do you see my point of view more clearly now arnold admitted that he thought that after all there might be something to be said for it that s right said the governor and the tax on sheep you don t object to that no and the tax on cows i like it and those on bread and buns and lemonade i enjoy them excellent in fact you re quite contented quite and you think the rest of the people are oh quite quite and do you think the same he asked of walter and werner oh yes your excellency they cried then that s all right said gessler i was sure you would be sensible about it now if you will kindly place in the tambourine which the gentleman on my left is presenting to you a mere trifle to compensate us for our trouble in giving you an audience and if you to arnold of

finished this speech the three spokesmen of the people of switzerland were shown out of the hall of audience chapter ii they were met in the street outside by a large body of their fellow citizens who had accompanied them to the palace and who had been spending the time since their departure in listening by turns at the keyhole of the front door but as the hall of audience was at the other side of the palace and cut off from the front door by two other doors a flight of stairs and a long passage they had not heard very much of what had gone on inside and they surrounded the three spokesmen as they came out and questioned them eagerly has he taken off the tax on jam asked ulric the smith what is he going to do about the tax on mixed biscuits shouted klaus von der flue who was a chimney sweep of the town and loved mixed biscuits never mind about tea and mixed biscuits cried his neighbour meier of sarnen what i want to know is whether we shall have to pay for keeping sheep any more what did the governor say asked jost weiler a practical man who liked to go straight to the point the three spokesmen looked at one another a little doubtfully we e ll said werner stauffacher at last as a matter of fact he didn t actually say very much it was more what he did if you understand me than what he said i should describe his excellency the governor said walter f rst as a man who has got a way with him a man who has got all sorts of arguments at his finger tips at the mention of finger tips arnold of melchthal uttered a sharp howl in short continued walter after a few minutes very interesting conversation he made us see that it really wouldn t do and that we must go on paying the taxes as before there was a dead silence for several minutes while everybody looked at everybody else in dismay the silence was broken by arnold of sewa arnold of sewa had been disappointed at not being chosen as one of the three spokesmen and he thought that if he had been so chosen all this trouble would not have occurred the fact is he said bitterly that you three have failed to do what you were sent to do i mention no names far from it but i don t mind saying that there are some people in this town who would have given a better account of themselves what you want in little matters of this sort is if i may say so tact tact that s what you want of course if you will go rushing into the governor s presence but we didn t rush said walter f rst shouting out that you want the taxes abolished but we didn t shout said walter f rst i really cannot speak if i am to be constantly interrupted said arnold of sewa severely what i say is that you ought to employ tact tact that s what you want if i had been chosen to represent the swiss people in this affair i am not saying i ought to have been mind you i merely say if i had been i should have acted rather after the following fashion walking firmly but not defiantly into the tyrant s presence i should have broken the ice with some pleasant remark about the weather the conversation once started the rest would have been easy i should have said that i hoped his excellency had enjoyed a good dinner once on the subject of food and it would have been the simplest of tasks to show him how unnecessary taxes on food were and the whole affair would have been pleasantly settled while you waited i do not imply that the swiss people would have done better to have chosen me as their representative i merely say that that is how i should have acted had they done so and arnold of sewa twirled his moustache and looked offended his friends instantly suggested that he should be allowed to try where the other three had failed and the rest of the crowd beginning to hope once more took up the cry the result was that the visitors bell of the palace was rung for the second time arnold of sewa went in and the door was banged behind him five minutes later he came out sucking the first finger of his left hand no he said it can t be done the tyrant has convinced me i knew he would said arnold of melchthal then i think you might have warned me snapped arnold of sewa dancing with the pain of his burnt finger was it hot boiling

and never having taken anything from the funds of the army and lastly not to weary the reader that whatever may be thought of its methods and of the noise made by the or so of voluntary bandsmen who belong to it it is undoubtedly for good or evil one of the world forces of our age before going further it may perhaps be well that i should explain how it is that i come to write these pages first i ought to state that my personal acquaintance with the salvation army dates back a good many years from the time indeed when i was writing rural england in connexion with which work i had a long and interesting interview with general booth that is already published subsequently i was appointed by the british government as a commissioner to investigate and report upon the land colonies of the salvation army in the united states in the course of which inquiry i came into contact with many of its officers and learned much of its system and methods especially with reference to emigration also i have had other opportunities of keeping in touch with the army and its developments in the spring of i was asked on behalf of general booth whether i would undertake to write for publication an account of the social work of the army in this country after some hesitation for the lack of time was a formidable obstacle to a very busy man i assented to this request the plan agreed upon being that i should visit the various institutions or a number of them etc and record what i actually saw neither more nor less together with my resulting impressions this i have done and it only remains for me to assure the reader that the record is true and to the best of his belief and ability set down without fear favour or prejudice by one not unaccustomed to such tasks almost at the commencement of my labours i sought an interview with general booth thinking as i told him and his officers the salvation army is not mealy mouthed about such matters that at his age it would be well to set down his views in black and white on the whole i found him well and vigorous he complained however of the difficulty he was experiencing owing to the complete loss of sight in one eye occasioned by an accident during a motor journey and the possible deprivation of the sight of the other through cataract of the attacks that have been and are continually made upon the salvation army some of them extremely bitter general booth would say little he pointed out that he had not been in the habit of defending himself and his organization in public and was quite content that the work should speak for itself their affairs and finances had been investigated by eminent men who could not find a sixpence out of place and for the rest a balance sheet was published annually this balance sheet for the year ending september i reprint in an appendix with regard to the social work of the army which in its beginning was a purely religious body general booth said that they had been driven into it because of their sympathy with suffering they found it impossible to look upon people undergoing starvation or weighed down by sorrows and miseries that came upon them through poverty without stretching out a hand to help them on to their feet again in the same way they could not study wrongdoers and criminals and learn their secret histories which show how closely a great proportion of human sin is connected with wretched surroundings without trying to help and reform them to the best of their abilities thus it was that their social operations began increased and multiplied they contemplated not only the regeneration of the individual but also of his circumstances and were continually finding out new methods by which this might be done the army looked forward to the development of its social work on the lines of self help self management and self support whenever a new development came under consideration the question arose how is it to be financed the work they had in hand at present took all their funds one of their great underlying principles was that of the necessity of self support without which no business or undertaking could stand for long the individual must co operate in his own moral and physical redemption at the same time this system of theirs was in practice one of the difficulties with which they had to contend since it caused the benevolent to believe that the army did not need financial assistance his own view was that they ought to receive support in their work from the government as they actually did in some other countries especially did he desire to receive state aid in dealing with ascertained criminals such as was extended to them in certain parts of the world thus only a few weeks before in holland the parliament had asked the salvation army to co operate in the care of discharged prisoners and gave a grant of money for their support in java the tale was the same there they were preparing estates as homes for lepers and soon a large portion of the leper population of that land would be in their charge general booth told me the story of a celebrated danish doctor an optician who became attracted to the army and giving up his practice and position entered its service with his wife they said they wished to lead a life of real sacrifice and self denial and so after going through a training like any other cadets were sent out to take charge of the medical work in java a recent report stated that this officer had attended patients in nine months and performed operations in australia the government had

i were sure absolutely sure that old man coyote meant what he said about our being friends i d start out this very minute to call on all my old friends my my my it seems an age since i visited the smiling pool and saw grandfather frog and jerry muskrat and billy mink and little joe otter mr coyote sounded as if he really meant to leave me alone but but well perhaps he did mean it when he saw me sitting here safe among the brambles but if i should meet him out in the open he might change his mind and oh dear his teeth are terrible long and sharp peter sat a little longer thinking and thinking then a bright idea popped into his head he kicked up his heels i ll do it said he i ll make a journey that s what i ll do i ll make a journey and see the great world by staying here and sitting still i m sure i ll simply grow quite ill a change of scene is what i need to be from all my trouble freed of course if peter had really stopped to think the matter over thoroughly he would have known that running away from one kind of trouble is almost sure to lead to other troubles but peter is one of those who does his thinking afterward peter is what is called impulsive that is he does things and then thinks about them later and often wishes he hadn t done them so now the minute the idea of making a journey popped into his head he made up his mind that he would do it and that was all there was to it you see peter never looks ahead if he could get rid of the trouble that bothered him now which you know was nothing but lonesomeness he wouldn t worry about the troubles he might get into later now the minute peter made up his mind to make a journey he began to feel better his lost appetite returned and the first thing he did was to eat a good meal of sweet clover let me see said he as he filled his big stomach i believe i ll visit the old pasture it s a long way off and i ve never been there but i ve heard sammy jay say that it s a very wonderful place and i don t believe it is any more dangerous than the green meadows and the green forest now that old man coyote and reddy and granny fox are all living here i ll start tonight when i am sure that old man coyote is nowhere around and i won t tell a soul where i am going so peter settled himself and tried to sleep the long day away but his mind was so full of the long journey he was going to make that he couldn t sleep much and when he did have a nap he dreamed of wonderful sights and adventures out in the great world at last he saw jolly round red mr sun drop down to his bed behind the purple hills old mother west wind came hurrying back from her day s work and gathered her children the merry little breezes into her big bag and then she too started for her home behind the purple hills a little star came out and winked at peter and then way over on the edge of the green forest he heard old man coyote laugh peter grinned that was what he had been waiting for since it meant that old man coyote was so far away that there was nothing to fear from him peter hopped out from the dear safe old briar patch looked this way and that way and then with his heart in his mouth started towards the old pasture as fast as he could go lipperty lipperty lip chapter iii hooty the owl changes his hunting grounds a full stomach makes a pleasant day an empty stomach turns the whole world gray peter rabbit hooty the owl sat on the tip top of a tall dead tree in the green forest while the black shadows crept swiftly among the trees he was talking to himself it wouldn t have done for him to have spoken aloud what he was saying to himself for then the little people in feathers and fur on whom he likes to make his dinner would have heard him and known just where he was so he said it to himself and sat so still that he looked for all the world like a part of the tree on which he was sitting what he was saying was this towhit towhoo towhit towhoo will some one tell me what to do my children have an appetite that keeps me hunting all the night and though their stomachs i may stuff they never seem to have enough towhit towhoo towhit towhoo will some one tell me what to do when it was dark enough he gave his fierce hunting call whooo hoo hoo whoo hoo now that is a terrible sound in the dark woods very terrible indeed to the little forest people because it sounds so fierce and hungry it makes them jump and shiver and that is just what hooty wants them to do for in doing it one of them is likely to make just the least scratching with his claws or to rustle a leaf if he does hooty whose ears are very very wonderful is almost sure to hear and with his great yellow eyes see him and then hooty has his dinner the very night when peter rabbit started on his journey to the old pasture hooty the owl had made

closed the front door behind him with a bang and then discovered that it was raining too proud to return for his umbrella he turned up his coat collar and thrusting his hands in his pockets walked slowly down the desolate little street by the time he had walked a dozen yards he began to think that he might as well have waited until the morning before he had walked fifty he was certain of it he passed the night at a coffee house and rose so early in the morning that the proprietor took it as a personal affront and advised him to get his breakfast elsewhere it was the longest day in mr hatchard s experience and securing modest lodgings that evening he overslept himself and was late at the warehouse next morning for the first time in ten years his personal effects arrived next day but no letter came from his wife and one which he wrote concerning a pair of missing garments received no reply he wrote again referring to them in laudatory terms and got a brief reply to the effect that they had been exchanged in part payment on a pair of valuable pink vases the pieces of which he could have by paying the carriage in six weeks mr hatchard changed his lodgings twice a lack of those home comforts which he had taken as a matter of course during his married life was a source of much tribulation and it was clear that his weekly bills were compiled by a clever writer of fiction it was his first experience of lodgings and the difficulty of saying unpleasant things to a woman other than his wife was not the least of his troubles he changed his lodgings for a third time and much surprised at his wife s continued silence sought out a cousin of hers named joe pett and poured his troubles into that gentleman s reluctant ear if she was to ask me to take her back he concluded i m not sure mind you that i wouldn t do so it does you credit said mr pett well ta ta i must be off and i expect she d be very much obliged to anybody that told her so said mr hatchard clutching at the other s sleeve mr pett gazing into space said that he thought it highly probable it wants to be done cleverly though said mr hatchard else she might get the idea that i wanted to go back i s pose you know she s moved said mr pett with the air of a man anxious to change the conversation eh said the other number thirty seven john street said mr pett told my wife she s going to take in lodgers calling herself mrs harris after her maiden name he went off before mr hatchard could recover and the latter at once verified the information in part by walking round to his old house bits of straw and paper littered the front garden the blinds were down and a bill was pasted on the front parlor window aghast at such determination he walked back to his lodgings in gloomy thought on saturday afternoon he walked round to john street and from the corner of his eye as he passed stole a glance at no he recognized the curtains at once and seeing that there was nobody in the room leaned over the palings and peered at a card that stood on the window sash furnished apartments for single young man board if desired he walked away whistling and after going a little way turned and passed it again he passed in all four times and then with an odd grin lurking at the corners of his mouth strode up to the front door and knocked loudly he heard somebody moving about inside and more with the idea of keeping his courage up than anything else gave another heavy knock at the door it was thrown open hastily and the astonished face of his wife appeared before him what do you want she inquired sharply mr hatchard raised his hat good afternoon ma am he said politely what do you want repeated his wife i called said mr hatchard clearing his throat i called about the bill in the window illustration i called about the bill in the window mrs hatchard clutched at the door post well she gasped i d like to see the rooms said the other but you ain t a single young man said his wife recovering i m as good as single said mr hatchard i should say better you ain t young objected mrs hatchard i m three years younger than what you are said mr hatchard dispassionately his wife s lips tightened and her hand closed on the door mr hatchard put his foot in if you don t want lodgers why do you put a bill up he inquired i don t take the first that comes said his wife i ll pay a week in advance said mr hatchard putting his hand in his pocket of course if you re afraid of having me here afraid o giving way to tenderness i mean afraid choked mrs hatchard tenderness i i just a matter o business continued her husband that s my way of looking at it that s a man s way i s pose women are different they can t come in said mrs hatchard breathing hard mr hatchard obeyed and clapping a hand over his mouth ascended the stairs behind her at the top she threw open the door of a tiny bedroom and stood aside for him to enter mr hatchard sniffed critically smells rather stuffy he said at last you needn t have it said his wife abruptly there s plenty of other fish in the sea yes and i expect they d stay there if they saw this room said the other don t think i want you to have it because i don t said mrs hatchard making a preliminary movement to showing him downstairs they might suit me said mr hatchard musingly as he peeped in at the sitting room door i shouldn t be at home much i m a

travelled in coolies whatever they may be now my dear fellow do you know what kind of man your guest is or don t you he seems to be a military and sporting kind of gent so to speak said maitland but what does it matter then you don t know why he left his private tutor s you don t know why he left the university you don t know why he left the ninety second you don t know and no one does what he did after that and you never heard of that affair with the frenchman in egypt well maitland replied about his ancient history i own i don t know anything as to the row with the frenchman at cairo he told me himself he said the beggar was too small for him to lick and that duelling was ridiculous they didn t take that view of it at shephard s hotel well it is not my affair said maitland one should

do my moral character any harm i m not likely to deal in coolies at my time of life nor quarrel with warlike aliens no but he s not a good man to introduce to these boys from oxford barton was saying when the subject of their conversation came up surrounded by his little court of undergraduates the hon thomas cranley was a good deal older than the company in which he found himself without being one of the hoary youths who play falstaff to every fresh heir s prince harry he was a middle aged man too obviously accustomed to the society of boys his very dress spoke of a prolonged youth x large cat s eye circled with diamonds blazed solitary in his shirt front and his coat was cut after the manner of the contemporary reveller his chin was clean shaven and his face though a good deal worn was ripe smooth shining with good cheer and of a purply bronze hue from exposure to hot suns and familiarity with the beverages of many peoples his full red lips with their humorous corners were shaded by a small black mustache and his twinkling bistre colored eyes beneath mobile black eyebrows gave cranley the air of a jester and a good fellow in manner he was familiar with a kind of deference too and reserve like a dog that is always wagging his tail and deprecating a kick thought barton grimly as he watched the other s genial advance he s going to say good night bless him thought maitland gratefully now the others will be moving too i hope so maitland rose with much alacrity as cranley approached him to stand up would show he thought that he was not inhospitably eager to detain the

your friend will walk with us here he bowed slightly in the direction of barton there will be a little bac going on he continued un petit bac de sant and these boys tell me they have never played anything more elevating than loo i m afraid i am no good at a round game answered maitland who had played at his aunt s at christmas and who now observed with delight that everyone was moving but here is barton who will be happy to accompany you i daresay if you re for a frolic boys said barton quoting dr johnson and looking rather at the younger men than at cranley why i will not balk you good night maitland and he shook hands with his host good nights were uttered in every direction sticks hats and umbrellas were hunted up and while maitland half asleep was being whirled to his rooms in bloomsbury in a hansom his guests made the frozen pavement of piccadilly ring beneath their elegant heels it is only round the corner said cranley to the four or five men who accompanied him the cockpit where i am taking you is in a fashionable slum off st james s we re just there there was nothing either meretricious or sinister in the aspect of that favored resort the cockpit as the decade club was familiarly called by its friends and enemies two young merton men and the freshman from new who were enjoying their christmas vacation in town and had been dining with maitland were a little disappointed in the appearance of the place they had hoped to knock mysteriously at a back door in a lane and to be shown after investigating through a loopholed wicket into a narrow staircase which again should open on halls of light full of blazing wax candles and magnificent lacqueys while a small mysterious man would point out the secret hiding room and the passages leading on to the roof or into the next house in case of a raid by the police such was the old idea of a hell but the advance of thought has altered all these early notions the decade club was like any other small club a current of warm air charged with tobacco smoke rushed forth into the frosty night when the swinging door was opened a sleepy porter looked out of his little nest and cranley wrote the names of the companions he introduced in a book which was kept for that purpose now you are free of the cockpit for the night he said genially it s a livelier place in the small hours than that classical olympic

they seemed to have no relation to the regularly spaced bursts of smoke along a little smear in the desert earth two thousand yards away no connection at all with the strong voices overhead coming and going it was as impersonal as the drive of the sea along a breakwater thus it went a pause a gathering of sound like the race of an incoming wave then the high flung heads of breakers spouting white up the face of a groyne suddenly a seventh wave broke and spread the shape of its foam like a plume overtopping all the others that s one of our torpilleurs what you call trench sweepers said the observer among the whispering leaves some one crossed the platform to consult the map with its ranges a blistering outbreak of white smokes rose a little beyond the large plume it was as though the tide had struck a reef out yonder then a new voice of tremendous volume lifted itself out of a lull that followed somebody laughed evidently the voice was known that is not for us a gunner said they are being waked up from he named a distant french position so and so is attending to them there we go on with our usual work look another torpilleur the barbarian again a big plume rose and again the lighter shells broke at their appointed distance beyond it the smoke died away on that stretch of trench as the foam of a swell dies in the angle of a harbour wall and broke out afresh half a mile lower down in its apparent laziness in its awful deliberation and its quick spasms of wrath it was more like the work of waves than of men and our high platform s gentle sway and glide was exactly the motion of a ship drifting with us toward that shore the usual work only the usual work the officer explained sometimes it is here sometimes above or below us i have been here since may a little sunshine flooded the stricken landscape and made its chemical yellow look more foul a detachment of men moved out on a road which ran toward the french trenches and then vanished at the foot of a little rise other men appeared moving toward us with that concentration of purpose and bearing shown in both armies when dinner is at hand they looked like people who had been digging hard the same work always the same work the officer said and you could walk from here to the sea or to switzerland in that ditch and you ll find the same work going on everywhere it isn t war it s better than that

some one called down through the branches to ask who was attending to belial let us say for i could not catch the gun s name it seemed to belong to that terrific new voice which had lifted itself for the second or third time it appeared from the reply that if belial talked too long he would be dealt with from another point miles away the troops we came down to see were at rest in a chain of caves which had begun life as quarries and had been fitted up by the army for its own uses there were underground corridors ante chambers rotundas and ventilating shafts with a bewildering play of cross lights so that wherever you looked you saw goya s pictures of men at arms every soldier has some of the old maid in him and rejoices in all the gadgets and devices of his own invention death and wounding come by nature but to lie dry sleep soft and keep yourself clean by forethought and contrivance is art and in all things the frenchman is gloriously an artist moreover the french officers seem as mother keen on their men as their men are brother fond of them maybe the possessive form of address mon general mon capitaine helps the idea which our men cloke in other and curter phrases and

robust and strong the law of descent was however inexorable and on the death of alexis theodore ascended to the throne besides even if it had been possible to choose among the sons of alexis peter was at this time altogether too young to reign for at his father s death he was only about four years old he was born in and his father died in theodore was at this time about sixteen of course however being so young and his health being so infirm he could not take any active part in the administration of government but was obliged to leave every thing in the hands of his counselors and ministers of state who managed affairs as they thought proper though they acted always in theodore s name there were a great many persons who were ambitious of having a share of the power which the young czar thus left in the hands of his subordinates and among these perhaps the most ambitious of all was the princess sophia theodore s sister who was all this time shut up in the convent to which the rules and regulations of imperial etiquette consigned her she was very uneasy in this confinement and wished very much to get released thinking that if she could do so she should be able to make herself of considerable consequence in the management of public affairs so she made application to the authorities to be allowed to go to the palace to see and take care of her brother in his sickness this application was at length complied with and sophia went to the palace here she devoted herself with so much assiduity to the care of her brother watching constantly at his bedside and suffering no one to attend upon him or to give him medicines but herself that she won not only his heart but the hearts of all the nobles of the court by her seemingly disinterested sisterly affection indeed it is not by any means impossible that sophia might have been at first disinterested and sincere in her desire to minister to the wants of her brother and to solace and comfort him in his sickness but however this may have been at the outset the result was that after a time she acquired so much popularity and influence that she became quite an important personage at court she was a very talented and accomplished young woman and was possessed moreover of a strong and masculine character yet she was very agreeable and insinuating in her manners and she conversed so affably and at the same time so intelligently with all the grandees of the empire as they came by turns to visit her brother in his sick chamber that they all formed a very high estimate of her character she also obtained a great ascendency over the mind of theodore himself and this of itself very much increased her importance in the eyes of the courtiers they all began to think that if they wished to obtain any favor of the emperor it was essential that they should stand well with the princess thus every one finding how fast she was rising in influence wished to have the credit of being her earliest and most devoted friend so they all vied with each other in efforts to aid in aggrandizing her things went on in this way very prosperously for a time but at length as might have been anticipated suspicions and jealousies began to arise and after a time the elements of a party opposed to the princess began to be developed these consisted chiefly of the old nobles of the empire the heads of the great families who had been accustomed under the emperors to wield the chief power of the state these persons were naturally jealous of the ascendency which they saw that the princess was acquiring and they began to plot together in order to devise means for restricting or controlling it but besides these nobles there was another very important power at the imperial court at this time namely the army in all despotic governments it is necessary for the sovereign to have a powerful military force under his command to maintain him in his place and it is necessary for him to keep this force as separate and independent as possible from the people there was in russia at this time a very powerful body of troops which had been organized by the emperors and was maintained by them as an imperial guard the name of this body of troops was the strelitz but in order not to encumber the narrative unnecessarily with foreign words i shall call them simply the guards of course a body of troops like these organized and maintained by a despotic dynasty for the express purpose in a great measure of defending the sovereign against his subjects becomes in time a very important element of power in the state the officers form a class by themselves separate from and jealous of the nobles of the country and this state of things has often led to very serious collisions and outbreaks the guards have sometimes

a military despotism this happened in the days of the roman empire the army which was originally formed by the regular authorities of the country and kept for a time in strict subjection to them finally became too powerful to be held any longer under control and they made their own leading general emperor for many successive reigns thus wholly subverting the republic which originally

with my tea and my muffin a boiled egg or two and a dab of marmalade but it was from a far other store of condiments i most liberally helped myself i was lucidly aware of so gorging esoterically as it

the homeliest notes of the impression the damp and darksome light washed in from the steep black bricky street the crackle of the strong draught of the british sea coal fire much more confident of its

t of a sudden taken on such a wealth of suggestion it represented at once a chain stretching off to heaven knew where but far into one s future at least one s possibilities of life and every link and pulse of which it was going accordingly to be indispensable besides being delightful and wonderful to recognise recognition i dare say was what remained through the adventure of the months to come the liveliest principle at work both as bearing on the already known on things unforgotten and of a sense intensely cultivated and cherished from my younger time and on the imagined the unimagined and the unimaginable a quantity that divided itself somehow into the double muster of its elements an endless vista or waiting array down the middle of which i should inconceivably pass inconceivably save for being sure of some thrilled arrest some exchange of assurance and response at every step obviously half the charm as i can but thinly describe it of the substantially continuous experience the first passages of which i thus note was in the fact that immensely moved by it as i was and having so to deal with it in the anticipatory way or to the whatevers and wherevers and whenevers within me that should find it in order i yet felt it in no degree as strange or obscure baffling or unrecognising on its own side everything was so far from impenetrable that my most general notion was the very ecstasy of understanding and that really wherever i looked and still more wherever i pressed i sank in and in up to my nose this in particular was of the perfect felicity that while the fact of difference all round me was immense the embarrassment of it was nil as if the getting into relation with the least waste had been prepared from so far back that a sort of divine economy now fairly ruled it was doubtless a part of the total fatuity and perhaps its sublimest mark that i knew what everything meant not simply then but for weeks and months after and was to know less only with increase of knowledge that must indeed have been of the essence of the general effect and the particular felicity only not grotesque because for want of occasion not immediately exhibited a consciousness not other than that of a person abruptly introduced into a preoccupied and animated circle and yet so miraculously aware of the matters conversed about as to need no word of explanation before joining in to say of such a person that he hadn t lost time would i knew be feebly to express his advantage my likeness to him at any rate probably fell short of an absurd one through the chapter of accidents mostly of the happiest in their way too which restraining the personal impulse for me kept appearances and pretensions down the feast as it more and more opened out was all of the objective as we have learned so comfortably to say or at least of its convenient opposite only in so far as this undertook to interpret it for myself alone to return at all across the years to the

account of them has to shake them together fairly hard making a coherent thing of them to profit by the contribution of each in speaking of my earliest renewal of the vision of europe if i may give so grand a name to a scarce more than merely enlarged and uplifted gape i have i confess truly to jerk myself over the ground to wrench myself with violence from memories and images stages and phases and branching arms that catch and hold me as i pass them by such a matter as my recovery of contact with london for a few weeks the contact broken off some nine years before lays so many plausible traps for me that discretion half warns me to stand off the ground and walk round it altogether i stop my ears to the advice however under the pleading reminder that just those days began a business for me that was to go ever so much further than i then dreamed and planted a seed that was by my own measure singularly to sprout and flourish the harvest of which i almost permit myself to believe has even yet not all been gathered i foresee moreover how little i shall be able to resist throughout these notes the force of persuasion expressed in the individual vivid image of the past wherever

had clusters of five leaves and which of three the horse on which mr croft had ridden over from the springs was tied to a fence near by and he now seemed to indicate by his restless movements that it was quite time for the gentleman to go home but with this opinion mr croft decidedly differed he had had a long walk with the lady and plenty of opportunities to say anything that he might choose but still there was something very important which had not been said and which mr croft very much wished to say before he left miss roberta that afternoon his only reason for hesitation was the fact that he did not know what he wished to say he was a man who always kept a lookout on the bows of his daily action in storm or in calm in fog or in bright sunshine that lookout must be at his post and upon his reports it depended whether mr croft set more sail put on more steam reversed his engine or anchored his vessel a report from this lookout was what he hoped to elicit by the remark which he wished to make he desired greatly to know whether miss roberta march looked upon him in the light of a lover or in that of an intimate acquaintance whose present intimacy depended a good deal upon the propinquity of midbranch and the green sulphur springs he had endeavored to produce upon her mind the latter impression if he ever wished her to regard him as a lover he could do this in the easiest and most straightforward way but the other procedure was much more difficult and he was not certain that he had succeeded in it how to find out in what light she viewed him without allowing the lady to perceive his purpose was a very delicate operation i wish said miss roberta poking with the end of her parasol at some half withered wild flowers which lay on the steps beneath her that you would change your mind and take supper with us mr croft s mind was very busy in endeavoring to think of some casual remark some observation regarding man nature or society or even an anecdote or historical incident which if brought into the conversation might produce upon the lady s countenance some shade of expression or some variation in her tone or words which would give him the information he sought for but what he said was are they really suppers that you have or are they only teas now i know said the lady why you have sometimes taken dinner with us but never supper you were afraid that it would be a tea lawrence croft was thinking that if this girl believed that he was in love with her it would make a great deal of difference in his present course of action if such were the case he ought not to come here so often or in fact he ought not to come at all until he had decided for himself what he was going to do but what could he say that would cause her for the briefest moment to unveil her idea of himself i never could endure he said those meals which consist of thin shavings of bread with thick plasters of butter aided and abetted by sweet cakes preserves and tea you should have reserved those remarks she said until you had found out what sort of evening meal we have he could certainly say something he thought perhaps it might be some little fanciful story which would call up in her mind without his appearing to intend it some thought of his relationship to her as a lover that is if she had ever had such a notion if this could be done her face would betray the fact but not being ready to make such a remark he said i beg your pardon but do you really have suppers in the english fashion oh no answered miss roberta we don t have a great cold joint with old cheese and pitchers of brown stout and ale but neither do we content ourselves with thin bread and butter and preserves we have coffee as well as tea hot rolls fleecy and light hot batter bread made of our finest corn meal hot biscuits and stewed fruit with plenty of sweet milk and buttermilk and if anybody wants it he can always have a slice of cold ham if i could only feel sure thought mr croft that she looked upon me merely as an acquaintance i would cease to trouble my mind on this subject and let everything go on as before but i am not sure and i would rather not come here again until i am and at what hour he asked do you partake of a meal like that in summer time said miss roberta we have supper when it is dark enough to light the lamps my uncle dislikes very much to be deprived by the advent of a meal of the out door enjoyment of a late afternoon or as we call it down here the evening it would be easy enough thought mr croft for me to say something about my being suddenly obliged to go away and then notice its effect upon her but apart from the fact that i would not do anything so vulgar and commonplace it would not advantage me in the slightest degree she would see through the flimsiness of my purpose and no matter how she looked upon me would show nothing but a well bred regret that i should be obliged to go away at such a pleasant season i think the hour for your supper said he is a very suitable one but i am not sure that such a variety of hot bread would agree with me did you ever see more healthy looking ladies and gentlemen than you find in virginia asked miss march it is not that i want to know if she looks favorably upon me said lawrence croft to himself for when i wish to discover that i shall simply ask her what i wish now to know is whether or not she considers me at all as a lover there surely must be something i can say which will give me a clew the virginians as a rule he replied are certainly a very well grown and vigorous race in spite of the hot bread she said with a smile just then mr croft believed himself struck by a happy thought,3

cerberus sopped himself in the pie and i saw that i must placate him if i were to get a share of it so i sighed to myself and accepted his work morality of course i want work i bluffed don t believe it he snorted try me i answered warming to the bluff all right he said come to the corner of blank and blank streets i have forgotten the address to morrow morning you know where that burned building is and i ll put you to work tossing bricks all right sir i ll be there he grunted and went on eating i waited after a couple of minutes he looked up with an i thought you were gone expression on his face and demanded well i i am waiting for something to eat i said gently i knew you wouldn t work he roared he was right of course but his conclusion must have been reached by mind reading for his logic wouldn t bear it out but the beggar at the door must be humble so i accepted his logic as i had accepted his morality you see i am now hungry i said still gently to morrow morning i shall be hungrier think how hungry i shall be when i have tossed bricks all day without anything to eat now if you will give me something to eat i ll be in great shape for those bricks he gravely considered my plea at the same time going on eating while his wife nearly trembled into propitiatory speech but refrained i ll tell you what i ll do he said between mouthfuls you come to work to morrow and in the middle of the day i ll advance you enough for your dinner that will show whether you are in earnest or not in the meantime i began but he interrupted if i gave you something to eat now i d never see you again oh i know your kind look at me i owe no man i have never descended so low as to ask any one for food i have always earned my food the trouble with you is that you are idle and dissolute i can see it in your face i have worked and been honest i have made myself what i am and you can do the same if you work and are honest like you i queried alas no ray of humor had ever penetrated the sombre work sodden soul of that man yes like me he answered all of us i queried yes all of you he answered conviction vibrating in his voice but if we all became like you i said allow me to point out that there d be nobody to toss bricks for you i swear there was a flicker of a smile in his wife s eye as for him he was aghast but whether at the awful possibility of a reformed humanity that would not enable him to get anybody to toss bricks for him or at my impudence i shall never know i ll not waste words on you he roared get out of here you ungrateful whelp i scraped my feet to advertise my intention of going and queried and i don t get anything to eat he arose suddenly to his feet he was a large man i was a stranger in a strange land and john law was looking for me i went away hurriedly but why ungrateful i asked myself as i slammed his gate what in the dickens did he give me to be ungrateful about i looked back i could still see him through the window he had returned to his pie by this time i had lost heart i passed many houses by without venturing up to them all houses looked alike and none looked good after walking half a dozen blocks i shook off my despondency and gathered my nerve this begging for food was all a game and if i didn t like the cards i could always call for a new deal i made up my mind to tackle the next house i approached it in the deepening twilight going around to the kitchen door i knocked softly and when i saw the kind face of the middle aged woman who answered as by inspiration came to me the story i was to tell for know that upon his ability to tell a good story depends the success of the beggar first of all and on the instant the beggar must size up his victim after that he must tell a story that will appeal to the peculiar personality and temperament of that particular victim and right here arises the great difficulty in the instant that he is sizing up the victim he must begin his story not a minute is allowed for preparation as in a lightning flash he must divine the nature of the victim and conceive a tale that will hit home the successful hobo must be an artist he must create spontaneously and instantaneously and not upon a theme selected from the plenitude of his own imagination but upon the theme he reads in the face of the person who opens the door be it man woman or child sweet or crabbed generous or miserly good natured or cantankerous jew or gentile black or white race prejudiced or brotherly provincial or universal or whatever else it may be i have often thought that to this training of my tramp days is due much of my success as a story writer in order to get the food whereby i lived i was compelled to tell tales that rang true at the back door out of inexorable necessity is developed the convincingness and sincerity laid down by all authorities on the art of the short story also i quite believe it was my tramp apprenticeship that made a realist out of me realism constitutes the only goods one can exchange at the kitchen door for grub after all art is only consummate artfulness and artfulness saves many a story i remember lying in a police station at winnipeg manitoba i was bound west over the canadian pacific of course the police wanted my story and i gave it to them on the spur of the moment they were landlubbers in the heart of the continent and what better story for them than a sea story they could never trip me,3

the captain nodded to the sergeant the sergeant stepped aside ii peyton farquhar was a well to do planter of an old and highly respected alabama family being a slave owner and like other slave owners a politician he was naturally an original secessionist and ardently devoted to the southern cause circumstances of an imperious nature which it is unnecessary to relate here had prevented him from taking service with that gallant army which had fought the disastrous campaigns ending with the fall of corinth and he chafed under the inglorious restraint longing for the release of his energies the larger life of the soldier the opportunity for distinction that opportunity he felt would come as it comes to all in wartime meanwhile he did what he could no service was too humble for him to perform in the aid of the south no adventure to perilous for him to undertake if consistent with the character of a civilian who was at heart a soldier and who in good faith and without too much qualification assented to at least a part of the frankly villainous dictum that all is fair in love and war one evening while farquhar and his wife were sitting on a rustic bench near the entrance to his grounds a gray clad soldier rode up to the gate and asked for a drink of water mrs farquhar was only too happy to serve him with her own white hands while she was fetching the water her husband approached the dusty horseman and inquired eagerly for news from the front the yanks are repairing the railroads said the man and are getting ready for another advance they have reached the owl creek bridge put it in order and built a stockade on the north bank the commandant has issued an order which is posted everywhere declaring that any civilian caught interfering with the railroad its bridges tunnels or trains will be summarily hanged i saw the order how far is it to the owl creek bridge farquhar asked about thirty miles is there no force on this side of the creek only a picket post half a mile out on the railroad and a single sentinel at this end of the bridge suppose a man a civilian and student of hanging should elude the picket post and perhaps get the better of the sentinel said farquhar smiling what could he accomplish the soldier reflected i was there a month ago he replied i observed that the flood of last winter had lodged a great quantity of driftwood against the wooden pier at this end of the bridge it is now dry and would burn like tinder the lady had now brought the water which the soldier drank he thanked her ceremoniously bowed to her husband and rode away an hour later after nightfall he repassed the plantation going northward in the direction from which he had come he was a federal scout iii as peyton farquhar fell straight downward through the bridge he lost consciousness and was as one already dead from this state he was awakened ages later it seemed to him by the pain of a sharp pressure upon his throat followed by a sense of suffocation keen poignant agonies seemed to shoot from his neck downward through every fiber of his body and limbs these pains appeared to flash along well defined lines of ramification and to beat with an inconceivably rapid periodicity they seemed like streams of pulsating fire heating him to an intolerable temperature as to his head he was conscious of nothing but a feeling of fullness of congestion these sensations were unaccompanied by thought the intellectual part of his nature was already effaced he had power only to feel and feeling was torment he was conscious of motion encompassed in a luminous cloud of which he was now merely the fiery heart without material substance he swung through unthinkable arcs of oscillation like a vast pendulum then all at once with terrible suddenness the light about him shot upward with the noise of a loud splash a frightful roaring was in his ears and all was cold and dark the power of thought was restored he knew that the rope had broken and he had fallen into the stream there was no additional strangulation the noose about his neck was already suffocating him and kept the water from his lungs to die of hanging at the bottom of a river the idea seemed to him ludicrous he opened his eyes in the darkness and saw above him a gleam of light but how distant how inaccessible he was still sinking for the light became fainter and fainter until it was a mere glimmer then it began to grow and brighten and he knew that he was rising toward the surface knew it with reluctance for he was now very comfortable to be hanged and drowned he thought that is not so bad but i do not wish to be shot no i will not be shot that is not fair he was not conscious of an effort but a sharp pain in his wrist apprised him that he was trying to free his hands he gave the struggle his attention as an idler might observe the feat of a juggler without interest in the outcome what splendid effort what magnificent what superhuman strength ah that was a fine endeavor bravo the cord fell away his arms parted and floated upward the hands dimly seen on each side in the growing light he watched them with a new interest as first one and then the other pounced upon the noose at his neck they tore it away and thrust it fiercely aside its undulations resembling those of a water snake put it back put it back he thought he shouted these words to his hands for the undoing of the noose had been succeeded by the direst pang that he had yet experienced his neck ached horribly his brain was on fire his heart which had been fluttering faintly gave a great leap trying to force

his cousin changed she had parted from him a child and now beneath the shadow of the wings of grief suddenly she had become a woman moreover the best and frankest part of their intimacy seemed to have vanished there was a veil between them mary thought of little and at this time seemed to care for no one except her mother who was dead and morris who had loved the child recoiled somewhat from the new born woman it may be explained that he was afraid of women still with an eye to business he spoke to her about the aerophone and so far as her memory served her she confirmed all the details of their short conversation across the gulf of empty space you see he said trembling with excitement i have got it at last it looks like it she answered wearily her thoughts already far away why shouldn t you there are so many odd things of the sort but one can never be sure it mightn t work next time will you try again he asked if you like she answered but i don t believe i shall hear anything now somehow since that last business everything seems different to me don t be foolish he said you have nothing to do with the hearing it is my new receiver i daresay she replied but then why couldn t you make it work with other people morris answered nothing he too wondered why next morning they made the experiment it failed other experiments followed at intervals most of which were fiascos although some were partially successful thus at times mary could hear what he said but except for a word or two and now and then a sentence he could not hear her whom when she was still a child and his playmate once he had heard so clearly why is it he said a year or two later dashing his fist upon the table in impotent rage it has been why can t it be mary turned her large blue eyes up to the ceiling and reflectively rubbed her dimpled chin with a very pretty finger isn t that the kind of question they used to ask oracles she asked lazily oh no it was the oracles themselves that were so vague well i suppose because was is as different from is as as is from shall be we are changed cousin that s all he pointed to his patent receiver and grew angry oh it isn t the receiver she said smoothing her curling hair it s us you don t understand me a bit not now and that s why you can t hear me take my advice morris and she looked at him sharply when you find a woman whom you can hear on your patent receiver you had better marry her it will be a good excuse for keeping her at a distance afterwards then he lost his temper indeed he raved and stormed and nearly smashed the patent receiver in his fury to a scientific man let it be admitted it was nothing short of maddening to be told that the successful working of his instrument to the manufacture of which he had given eight years of toil and study depended upon some pre existent sympathy between the operators of its divided halves if that were so what was the use of his wonderful discovery for who could ensure a sympathetic correspondent and yet the fact remained that when in their playmate days he understood his cousin mary and when her quiet indolent nature had been deeply moved by the shock of the news of her mother s peril the aerophone had worked whereas now when she had become a grown up young lady he did not understand her any longer he whose heart was wrapped up in his experiments and who by nature feared the adult members of her sex and shrank from them when too her placid calm was no longer stirred work it would not she laughed at his temper then grew serious and said don t get angry morris after all there are lots of things that you and i can t understand and it isn t odd that you should have tumbled across one of them if you think of it nobody understands anything they know that certain things happen and how to make them happen but they don t know why they happen or why as in your case when they ought to happen they won t it is all very well for you to be philosophical he answered turning upon her but can t you see mary that the thing there is my life s work it is what i have given all my strength and all my brain to make and if it fails in the end why then i fail too once and forever and i have made it talk it talked perfectly between this place and seaview and now you stand there and tell me that it won t work any more because i don t understand you then what am i to do try to understand me if you think it worth while which i don t or go on experimenting she answered try to find some substance which is less exquisitely sensitive something a little grosser more in key with the material world or to discover someone whom you do understand don t lose heart don t be beaten after all these years no he answered i don t unless i die and he turned to go morris she said in a softer voice i am lazy i know,3

will be dangerous even now she is overloaded i looked at the man in amazement he had spoken earnestly but he was as calm as if we were standing on a sidewalk and he endeavoring to dissuade me from boarding an overcrowded street car before i could say anything he spoke again i am going to remain on this ship she is a hundred times safer than any of those boats i have had a great deal of experience in regard to vessels and ocean navigation and it will be a long time before this vessel sinks if she ever sinks of her own accord she s just as likely to float as that derelict we ran into the steam is nearly out of her boilers by this time and nothing is likely to happen to her i wish you would stay with me here we will be safe with plenty of room and plenty to eat and drink when it is daylight we will hoist a flag of distress which will be much more likely to be seen than anything that can flutter from those little boats if you have noticed sir the inclination of this deck is not greater now than it was half an hour ago that proves that our bow has settled down about as far as it is going i think it likely that the water has entered only a few of the forward compartments the man spoke so confidently that his words made an impression upon me i knew that it very often happens that a wreck floats for a long time and the boat from which the men were now frantically shouting for the captain would certainly be dangerously crowded stay with me said mr crowder and i assure you with as much reason as any man can assure any other man of anything in this world that you will be perfectly safe this steamer is not going to sink there were rapid footsteps and i saw the captain and his second officer approaching step back here said mr crowder pulling me by the coat don t let them see us they may drag us on board that confounded boat keep quiet sir and let them get off they think they are the last on board involuntarily i obeyed him and we stood in the shadow of the great funnel the captain had reached the rail is every one in the boats he shouted in french and in english is every one in the boats i am going to leave the vessel i made a start as if to rush toward him but crowder held me by the arm don t you do it he whispered very earnestly i have the greatest possible desire to save you stay where you are and you will be all right that overloaded boat may capsize in half an hour illustration don t you do it i could not help it i believed him my own judgment seemed suddenly to rise up and ask me why i should leave the solid deck of the steamer for that perilous little boat i need say but little more in regard to this shipwreck when the fog lifted about ten o clock in the morning we could see no signs of any of the boats a mile or so away lay the dull black line of the derelict as if she were some savage beast who had bitten and torn us and was now sullenly waiting to see us die of the wound we hoisted a flag union down and then we went below to get some breakfast mr crowder knew all about the ship and where to find everything he told me he had made so many voyages that he felt almost as much at home on sea as on land we made ourselves comfortable all day and at night we went to our rooms and i slept fairly well although there was a very disagreeable slant to my berth the next day early in the afternoon our signal of distress was seen by a tramp steamer on her way to new york and we were taken off we cruised about for many hours in the direction the boats had probably taken and the next day we picked up two of them in a sorry condition the occupants having suffered many hardships and privations we never had news of the captain s boat but the others were rescued by a sailing vessel going eastward before we reached new york mr crowder had made me promise that i would spend a few days with him at his home in that city his family was small he told me a wife and a daughter about six and he wanted me to know them naturally we had become great friends very likely the man had saved my life and he had done it without any act of heroism or daring but simply by impressing me with the fact that his judgment was better than mine i am apt to object to people of superior judgment but mr crowder was an exception to the ordinary superior person from the way he talked it was plain that he had much experience of various sorts and that he had greatly advantaged thereby but he gave himself no airs on this account and there was nothing patronizing about him if i were able to tell him anything he did not know and i frequently was he was very glad to hear it moreover mr crowder was a very good man to look at he was certainly over fifty and his closely trimmed hair was white but he had a fresh and florid complexion he was tall and well made fashionably dressed and had an erect and somewhat military carriage he was fond of talking and seemed fond of me and these points in his disposition attracted me very much my relatives were few they lived in the west and i never had had a friend whose company was so agreeable to me as that of mr crowder mr crowder s residence was a handsome house in the upper part of the city his wife was a slender lady scarcely half his age with a sweet and interesting face and was attired plainly but tastefully in general appearance she seemed to be the opposite of her husband in every way she had suffered a week of anxiety and was so rejoiced at having her husband again that when i met her some hours after crowder had reached the house her glorified face seemed like that of an angel but there was nothing demonstrative about her even in her great joy she was as quiet as a dove and i was not surprised when her husband afterward told me that she was a qua,3

mr st gaudens s statue of the puritan his clothes were slightly shabby but always neat little as one might have guessed it however what may be called a certain transmuted enthusiasm was alive in him he had a hobby almost amounting to an obsession not uncommon amongst americans who have slipped downward in the social scale it was the bumpus family in america he collected documents about his ancestors and relations he wrote letters with a fine painful penmanship on a ruled block he bought at hartshorne s drug store to distant bumpuses in kansas and illinois and michigan common descendants of ebenezer the original immigrant of dolton many of these western kinsmen answered not so the magisterial bumpus who lived in boston on the water side of beacon whom likewise he had ventured to address to the indignation and disgust of his elder daughter janet why are you so proud of ebenezer she demanded once scornfully why aren t we descended from him how many generations seven said edward promptly emphasizing the last syllable janet was quick at figures she made a mental calculation well you ve got one hundred and twenty seven other ancestors of ebenezer s time haven t you edward was a little surprised he had never thought of this but his ardour for ebenezer remained undampened genealogy his own had become his religion and instead of going to church he spent his sunday mornings poring over papers of various degrees of discolouration making careful notes on the ruled block this consciousness of his descent from good american stock that had somehow been deprived of its heritage while a grievance to him was also a comfort it had a compensating side in spite of the lack of sympathy of his daughters and his wife hannah bumpus took the situation more grimly she was a logical projection in a new environment of the religious fatalism of ancestors whose god was a god of vengeance she did not concern herself as to what all this vengeance was about life was a trap into which all mortals walked sooner or later and her particular trap had a treadmill a round of household duties she kept whirling with an energy that might have made their fortunes if she had been the head of the family it is bad to be a fatalist unless one has an incontrovertible belief in one s destiny which hannah had not but she kept the little flat with its worn furniture which had known so many journeys as clean as a merchant ship of old salem and when it was scoured and dusted to her satisfaction she would sally forth to bonnaccossi s grocery and provision store on the corner to do her bargaining in competition with the italian housewives of the neighborhood she was wont indeed to pause outside for a moment her quick eye encompassing the coloured prints of red and yellow jellies cast in rounded moulds decked with slices of orange the gaudy boxes of cereals and buckwheat flour the brookfield eggs in packages significant this modern package system of an era of flats with little storage space she took in at a glance the blue lettered placard announcing the current price of butterine and walked around to the other side of the store on holmes street where the beef and bacon hung where the sidewalk stands were filled in the autumn with cranberries apples cabbages and spinach with little outer complaint she had adapted herself to the constantly lowering levels to which her husband had dropped and if she hoped that in fillmore street they had reached bottom she did not say so her unbetrayed regret was for the loss of what she would have called respectability and the giving up long ago in the little city which had been their home of the servant girl had been the first wrench until they came to hampton they had always lived in houses and her adaptation to a flat had been hard a flat without a parlour hannah bumpus regarded a parlour as necessary to a respectable family as a wedding ring to a virtuous woman janet and lise would be growing up there would be young men and no place to see them save the sidewalks the fear that haunted her came true and she never was reconciled the two girls went to the public schools and afterwards inevitably to work and it seemed to be a part of her punishment for the sins of her forefathers that she had no more control over them than if they had been boarders while she looked on helplessly they did what they pleased janet whom she never understood was almost as much a source of apprehension as lise who became part and parcel of all hannah deemed reprehensible in this new america which she refused to recognize and acknowledge as her own country to send them through the public schools had been a struggle hannah used to lie awake nights wondering what would happen if edward became sick it worried her that they never saved any money try as she would to cut the expenses down there was a limit of decency new england thrift hitherto justly celebrated was put to shame by that which the foreigners displayed and which would have delighted the souls of gentlemen of the manchester school every once in a while there rose up before her fabulous instances of this thrift of italians and jews who ignorant emigrants had entered the mills only a few years before they the bumpuses had come to hampton and were now independent property owners still rankling in hannah s memory was a day when lise had returned from school dark and mutinous with a tale of such a family one of the younger children was a classmate they live on jordan street in a house and laura has roller skates i don t see why i can t this was one

guarding the flame began to explore the house with the others close behind shadows danced on the walls and lurked in the corners as they proceeded at the end of the passage they found a second staircase and ascending it slowly gained the first floor careful said meagle as they gained the landing he held the candle forward and showed where the balusters had broken away then he peered curiously into the void beneath this is where the tramp hanged himself i suppose he said thoughtfully you ve got an unwholesome mind said white as they walked on this place is qutie creepy enough without your remembering that now let s find a comfortable room and have a little nip of whiskey apiece and a pipe how will this do he opened a door at the end of the passage and revealed a small square room meagle led the way with the candle and first melting a drop or two of tallow stuck it on the mantelpiece the others seated themselves on the floor and watched pleasantly as white drew from

pardonable sins postscript since the above was written news has arrived from america that a leading new york newspaper which was among the most abusively clamorous for the suppression of mrs warren s profession has just been fined heavily for deriving part of its revenue from advertisements of mrs warren s houses many people have been puzzled by the fact that whilst stage entertainments which are frankly meant to act on the spectators as aphrodisiacs are everywhere tolerated plays which have an almost horrifyingly contrary effect are fiercely attacked by persons and papers notoriously indifferent to public morals on all other occasions the explanation is very simple the profits of mrs warren s profession are shared not only by mrs warren and sir george crofts but by the landlords of their houses the newspapers which advertize them the restaurants which cater for them and in short all the trades to which they are good customers not to mention the public officials and representatives whom they silence by complicity corruption or blackmail add to these the employers who profit by cheap female labor and the shareholders whose dividends depend on it you find such people everywhere even on the judicial bench and in the highest places in church and state and you get a large and powerful class with a strong pecuniary incentive to protect mrs warren s profession and a correspondingly strong incentive to conceal from their own consciences no less than from the world the real sources of their gain these are the people who declare that it is feminine vice and not poverty that drives women to the streets as if vicious women with independent incomes ever went there these are the people who indulgent or indifferent to aphrodisiac plays raise the moral hue and cry against performances of mrs warren s profession and drag actresses to the police court to be insulted bullied and threatened for fulfilling their engagements for please observe that the judicial decision in new york state in favor of the play does not end the matter in kansas city for instance the municipality finding itself restrained by the courts from preventing the performance fell back on a local bye law against indecency to evade the constitution of the united states they summoned the actress who impersonated mrs warren to the police court and offered her and her colleagues the alternative of leaving the city or being prosecuted under this bye law now nothing is more possible than that the city councillors who suddenly displayed such concern for the morals of the theatre were either mrs warren s landlords or employers of women at starvation wages or restaurant keepers or newspaper proprietors or in some other more or less direct way sharers of the profits of her trade no doubt it is equally possible that they were simply stupid men who thought that indecency consists not in evil but in mentioning it i have however been myself a member of a municipal council and have not found municipal councillors quite so simple and inexperienced as this at all events i do not propose to give the kansas councillors the benefit of the doubt i therefore advise the public at large which will finally decide the matter to keep a vigilant eye on gentlemen who will stand anything at the theatre except a performance of mrs warren s profession and who assert in the same breath that a the play is too loathsome to be bearable by civilized people and b that unless its performance is prohibited the whole town will throng to see it they may be merely excited and foolish but i am bound to warn the public that it is equally likely that they may be collected and knavish at all events to prohibit the play is to protect the evil which the play exposes and in view of that fact i see no reason for assuming that the prohibitionists are disinterested moralists and that the author the managers and the performers who depend for their livelihood on their personal reputations and not on rents advertisements or dividends are grossly inferior to them in moral sense and public responsibility it is true that in mrs warren s profession society and not any individual is the villain of the piece but it does not follow that the people who take offence at it are all champions of society their credentials cannot be too carefully examined how he lied to her husband it is eight o

good as to let your master know that a moment later she was ushered into a sitting room a man s apartment untidy reeking of cigarette smoke and stale air there were photographs and souvenirs of women everywhere the windows were fast closed and the curtains half drawn the man who stood upon the hearthrug was of medium height dark with close cropped hair and a black drooping moustache his first glance at his visitor as the door opened was one of impertinent curiosity madame he inquired you are monsieur estermen he bowed he was very much impressed and he endeavored to assume a manner that is my name pray be seated she waved away the chair he offered my automobile is in the street below she said i wish you to come with me at once to see a poor girl who is dying he looked at her in amazement are you serious madame i am very serious indeed she replied the girl s name is lucie r nault for the moment he seemed perplexed then his eyebrows were slowly raised lucie r nault he repeated what do you know about her only that she is a poor child who has suffered at your hands and who is dying in a private hospital madame christophor answered she has been taken there out of charity she has no friends she is dying alone come with me i will take you to her you shall save her at least from that terror it was the aim of the man with whom she spoke to be considered modern a perfect and invincible selfishness had enabled him to reach the topmost heights of callousness and to remain there without affectation if the little girl is dying he said i am sorry for she was pretty and companionable although i have lost sight of her lately but as to my going out to see her why that is absurd i hate illness of all sorts the woman looked at him steadfastly looked at him as though she had come into contact with some strange creature do you understand what it is that i am saying she demanded this girl was once your little friend is it not so it was for your sake that she gave up the simple life she was living when you first knew her and went upon the stage the life was too strenuous for her she broke down took no care of herself developed a cough and alas tuberculosis the man sighed he had adopted an expression of abstract sympathy a terrible disease he murmured a terrible disease indeed madame christophor repeated do you not understand what i mean when i tell you that she is dying of it very likely she will not live a week perhaps not a day she lies there alone in the garden of the hospital and she is afraid there are none who knew her whom she cares for to take her into their arms and to bid her have no fear is it not your place to do this you have held her in your arms in life don t you see that it is your duty to cheer her a little way on this last dark journey the man threw away his cigarette and moved to the mantelpiece where he helped himself to a fresh one from the box madame he said i perceive that you are a sentimentalist she did not speak she could not she only looked at him death he continued lighting his cigarette is an ugly thing if it came to me i should probably be quite as much afraid perhaps more than any one else but it has not come to me just yet it has come you tell me to little lucie well i am sorry but there is nothing i can do about it i have no intention whatever of making myself miserable i do not wish to see her i do not wish to look upon death i simply wish to forget it if it were not madame he added with a bow and a meaning glance from his dark eyes that you bring with you something of your own so well worth looking upon i could almost find myself regretting your visit she still regarded him fixedly there was in her face something of that shrinking curiosity with which one looks upon an unclean and horrible thing that is your answer she murmured the man had little understanding and he replied boldly it is my answer without a doubt lucie if what you tell me is true as i do not for a moment doubt is dying from a disease the ravages of which are hideous to watch and which many people believe too to be infectious let me advise you madame to learn also a little wisdom let me beg of you not to be led away by these efforts of sentiment however picturesque and delightful they may seem the only life that is worth considering is our own the only death that we need fear is our own we ought to live like that the woman stood quite still she was tall and,4

ass not much bigger than a dog the colour of a mouse with a kindly eye and a determined under jaw there was something neat and high bred a quakerish elegance about the rogue that hit my fancy on the spot our first interview was in monastier market place to prove her good temper one child after another was set upon her back to ride and one after another went head over heels into the air until a want of confidence began to reign in youthful bosoms and the experiment was discontinued from a dearth of subjects i was already backed by a deputation of my friends but as if this were not enough all the buyers and sellers came round and helped me in the bargain and the ass and i and father adam were the centre of a hubbub for near half an hour at length she passed into my service for the consideration of sixty five francs and a glass of brandy the sack had already cost eighty francs and two glasses of beer so that modestine as i instantly baptized her was upon all accounts the cheaper article indeed that was as it should be for she was only an appurtenance of my mattress or self acting bedstead on four castors i had a last interview with father adam in a billiard room at the witching hour of dawn when i administered the brandy he professed himself greatly touched by the separation and declared he had often bought white bread for the donkey when he had been content with black bread for himself but this according to the best authorities must have been a flight of fancy he had a name in the village for brutally misusing the ass yet it is certain that he shed a tear and the tear made a clean mark down one cheek by the advice of a fallacious local saddler a leather pad was made for me with rings to fasten on my bundle and i thoughtfully completed my kit and arranged my toilette by way of armoury and utensils i took a revolver a little spirit lamp and pan a lantern and some halfpenny candles a jack knife and a large leather flask the main cargo consisted of two entire changes of warm clothing besides my travelling wear of country velveteen pilot coat and knitted spencer some books and my railway rug which being also in the form of a bag made me a double castle for cold nights the permanent larder was represented by cakes of chocolate and tins of bologna sausage all this except what i carried about my person was easily stowed into the sheepskin bag and by good fortune i threw in my empty knapsack rather for convenience of carriage than from any thought that i should want it on my journey for more immediate needs i took a leg of cold mutton a bottle of beaujolais an empty bottle to carry milk an egg beater and a considerable quantity of black bread and white like father adam for myself and donkey only in my scheme of things the destinations were reversed monastrians of all shades of thought in politics had agreed in threatening me with many ludicrous misadventures and with sudden death in many surprising forms cold wolves robbers above all the nocturnal practical joker were daily and eloquently forced on my attention yet in these vaticinations the true patent danger was left out like christian it was from my pack i suffered by the way before telling my own mishaps let me in two words relate the lesson of my experience if the pack is well strapped at the ends and hung at full length not doubled for your life across the pack saddle the traveller is safe the saddle will certainly not fit such is the imperfection of our transitory life it will assuredly topple and tend to overset but there are stones on every roadside and a man soon learns the art of correcting any tendency to overbalance with a well adjusted stone on the day of my departure i was up a little after five by six we began to load the donkey and ten minutes after my hopes were in the dust the pad would not stay on modestine s back for half a moment i returned it to its maker with whom i had so contumelious a passage that the street outside was crowded from wall to wall with gossips looking on and listening the pad changed hands with much vivacity perhaps it would be more descriptive to say that we threw it at each other s heads and at any rate we were very warm and unfriendly and spoke with a deal of freedom i had a common donkey pack saddle a barde as they call it fitted upon modestine and once more loaded her with my effects the doubled sack my pilot coat for it was warm and i was to walk in my waistcoat a great bar of black bread and an open basket containing the white bread the mutton and the bottles were all corded together in a very elaborate system of knots and i looked on the result with fatuous content in such a monstrous deck cargo all poised above the donkey s shoulders with nothing below to balance on a brand new pack saddle that had not yet been worn to fit the animal and fastened with brand new girths that might be expected to stretch and slacken by the way even a very careless traveller should have seen disaster brewing that elaborate system of knots again was the work of too many sympathisers to be very artfully designed it is true they tightened the cords with a will as many as three at a time would have a foot against modestine s quarters and be hauling with clenched teeth but i learned afterwards that one thoughtful person without any exercise of force can make a more solid job than half a dozen heated and enthusiastic grooms i was then but a novice even after the misadventure of the pad nothing could disturb my security and i went forth from the stable door as an

a knight and a widower he was knighted not because of personal merit but because he had been mayor of some place sometime or other when some one connected with royalty had something important to do with it little diana was all that this knight and widower had on earth to care for except of course his horses and dogs and guns and club and food he was very particular as to his food not that he was an epicure or a gourmand or luxurious or a hard drinker or anything of that sort by no means he could rough it so he said as well as any man and put up with whatever chanced to be going but when there was no occasion for roughing it he did like to see things well cooked and nicely served and wine you know was not worth drinking positively nauseous if it was not of the best sir richard was a poor man a very poor man he had only five thousand a year a mere pittance and he managed this sum in such a peculiar way that he never had anything wherewith to help a struggling friend or to give to the poor or to assist the various religious and charitable institutions by which he was surrounded while at certain intervals in the year he experienced exasperating difficulty in meeting the demands of those torments to society the tradespeople people who ought to be ashamed of themselves for not being willing to supply the nobility and gentry with food and clothing gratuitously moreover sir richard never by any chance laid anything by standing by the pony s head and making tender efforts to restrain his waywardness stood a boy a street boy a city arab to a londoner any description of this boy would be superfluous but it may be well to state for the benefit of the world at large that the class to which he belonged embodies within its pale the quintessence of rollicking mischief and the sublimate of consummate insolence this remarkable boy was afflicted with a species of dance not that of saint vitus but a sort of double shuffle with a stamp of the right foot at the end in which he was prone to indulge consciously and unconsciously at all times and the tendency to which he sometimes found it difficult to resist he was beginning to hum the sharply defined air to which he was in the habit of performing this dance when little diana said in a silvery voice quite in keeping with her beauty let go his head boy i m quite sure that he cannot bear restraint it may be remarked here that little di was probably a good judge on that point being herself nearly incapable of bearing restraint i d better not miss replied the boy with profound respect in tone and manner for he had yet

given to the reins which she held a jerk the brown pony deeming this full permission to go on went off with a bound that overturned the boy and caused the fore wheel to strike him on the leg as it passed springing up with the intention of giving chase to the runaway the little fellow again fell with a sharp cry of pain for his leg was broken at the same moment sir richard brandon issued from the door of his mansion leisurely and with an air of calm serenity pulling on his gloves it was one of the knight s maxims that under all circumstances a gentleman should maintain an appearance of imperturbable serenity when however he suddenly beheld the street boy falling and his daughter standing up in her wickerwork chariot holding on to the brown pony like an amazon warrior of ancient times his maxim somehow evaporated his serenity vanished so did his hat as he bounded from beneath it and left it far behind in his mad and hopeless career after the runaway a policeman coming up just

achieved by the true instaurators of physical science yet the majestic eloquence and the fervid vaticinations of one who was conspicuous alike by the greatness of his rise and the depth of his fall drew the attention of all the world to the new birth of time sidenote the defect of his method but it is not easy to discover satisfactory evidence that the novum organum had any direct beneficial influence on the advancement of natural knowledge no delusion is greater than the notion that method and industry can make up for lack of motherwit either in science or in practical life and it is strange that with his knowledge of mankind bacon should have dreamed that his or any other via inveniendi scientias would level men s wits and leave little scope for that inborn capacity which is called genius as a matter of fact bacon s via has proved hopelessly impracticable while the anticipation of nature by the invention of hypotheses based on incomplete inductions which he specially condemns has proved itself to be a most efficient indeed an indispensable instrument of scientific progress finally that transcendental alchemy the superinducement of new forms on matter which bacon declares to be the supreme aim of science has been wholly ignored by those who have created the physical knowledge of the present day even the eloquent advocacy of the chancellor brought no unmixed good to physical science it was natural enough that the man who in his better moments took all knowledge for his patrimony but in his worse sold that birthright for the mess of pottage of court favor and professional success for pomp and show should be led to attach an undue value to the practical advantages which he foresaw as roger bacon and indeed seneca had foreseen long before his time must follow in the train of the advancement of natural knowledge the burden of bacon s pleadings for science is the gathering of fruit the importance of winning solid material advantages by the investigation of nature and the desirableness of limiting the application of scientific methods of inquiry to that field sidenote hobbes sidenote descartes bacon s younger contemporary hobbes casting aside the prudent reserve of his predecessor in regard to those matters about which the crown or the church might have something to say extended scientific methods of inquiry to the phenomena of mind and the problems of social organisation while at the same time he indicated the boundary between the province of real and that of imaginary knowledge the principles of philosophy and the leviathan embody a coherent system of purely scientific thought in language which is a model of clear and vigorous english style at the same time in france a man of far greater scientific capacity than either bacon or hobbes ren descartes not only in his immortal discours de la m thode and elsewhere went down to the foundations of scientific certainty but in his principes de philosophie indicated where the goal of physical science really lay however descartes was an eminent mathematician and it would seem that the bent of his mind led him to overestimate the value of deductive reasoning from general principles as much as bacon had underestimated it the progress of physical science has been effected neither by baconians nor by cartesians as such but by men like galileo and harvey boyle and newton who would have done their work just as well if neither bacon nor descartes had ever propounded their views respecting the manner in which scientific investigation should be pursued sidenote for a time the progress without fruits the progress of science during the first century after bacon s death by means verified his sanguine prediction of the fruits which it would yield for though the revived and renewed study of nature had spread and grown to an extent which surpassed reasonable expectation the practical results the good to men s estate were at first by no means apparent sixty years after bacon s death newton had crowned the long labors of the astronomers and the physicists by coordinating the phenomena of solar motion throughout the visible universe into one vast system but the principia helped no man to either wealth or comfort descartes newton and leibnitz had opened up new worlds to the mathematician but the acquisitions of their genius enriched only man s ideal estate descartes had laid the foundations of rational cosmogony and of physiological psychology boyle had produced models of experimentation in various branches of physics and chemistry pascal and torricelli had weighed the air malpighi and grew ray and willoughby had done work of no less importance in the biological sciences but weaving and spinning were carried on with the old appliances nobody could travel faster by sea or by land than at any previous time in the world s history and king george could send a message from london to york no faster than king john might have done metals were worked from their ores by immemorial rule of thumb and the centre of the iron trade of these islands was still among the oak forests of sussex the utmost skill of our mechanicians did not get beyond the production of a coarse watch the middle of the eighteenth century is illustrated by a host of great names in science english french german and italian especially in the fields of chemistry geology and biology but this deepening and broadening of natural knowledge produced next to no immediate practical benefits even if at this time francis bacon could have returned to the scene of his greatness and of his littleness he must have regarded the philosophic world which praised and disregarded his precepts with great disfavor if ghosts are consistent he would have said these people are all wasting

else in dismay the silence was broken by arnold of sewa arnold of sewa had been disappointed at not being chosen as one of the three spokesmen and he thought that if he had been so chosen all this trouble would not have occurred the fact is he said bitterly that you three have failed to do what you were sent to do i mention no names far from it but i don t mind saying that there are some people in this town who would have given a better account of themselves what you want in little matters of this sort is if i may say so tact tact that s what you want of course if you will go rushing into the governor s presence but we didn t rush said walter f rst shouting out that you want the taxes abolished but we didn t shout said walter f rst i really cannot speak if i am to be constantly interrupted said arnold of sewa severely what i say is that you ought to employ tact tact that s what you want if i had been chosen to represent the swiss people in this affair i am not saying i ought to have been mind you i merely say if i had been i should have acted rather after the following fashion walking firmly but not defiantly into the tyrant s presence i should have broken the ice with some pleasant remark about the weather the conversation once started the rest would have been easy i should have said that i hoped his excellency had enjoyed a good dinner once on the subject of food and it would have been the simplest of tasks to show him how unnecessary taxes on food were and the whole affair would have been pleasantly settled while you waited i do not imply that the swiss people would have done better to have chosen me as their representative i merely say that that is how i should have acted had they done so and arnold of sewa twirled his moustache and looked offended his friends instantly suggested that he should be allowed to try where the other three had failed and the rest of the crowd beginning to hope once more took up the cry the result was that the visitors

but no letter came from his wife and one which he wrote concerning a pair of missing garments received no reply he wrote again referring to them in laudatory terms and got a brief reply to the effect

i m not sure mind you that i wouldn t do so it does you credit said mr pett well ta ta i must be off and i expect she d be very much obliged to anybody that told her so said mr hatchard clutching at the other s sleeve mr pett gazing into space said that he thought it highly probable it wants to be done cleverly though said mr hatchard else she might get the idea that i wanted to go back i s pose you know she s moved said mr pett with the air of a man anxious to change the conversation eh said the other number thirty seven john street said mr pett told my wife she s going to take in lodgers calling herself mrs harris after her maiden name he went off before mr hatchard could recover and the latter at once verified the information in part by walking round to his old house bits of straw and paper littered the front garden the blinds were down and a bill was pasted on the front parlor window aghast at such determination he walked back to his lodgings in gloomy thought on saturday afternoon he walked round to john street and from the corner of his eye as he passed stole a glance at no he recognized the curtains at once and seeing that there was nobody in the room leaned over the palings and peered at a card that stood on the window sash furnished apartments for single young man board if desired he walked away whistling and after going a little way turned and passed it again he passed in all four times and then with an odd grin lurking at the corners of his mouth strode up to the front door and knocked loudly he heard somebody moving about inside and more with the idea of keeping his courage up than anything else gave another heavy knock at the door it was thrown open hastily and the astonished face of his wife appeared before him what do you want she inquired sharply mr hatchard raised his hat good afternoon ma am he said politely what do you want repeated his wife i called said mr hatchard clearing his throat i called about the bill in the window illustration i called about the bill in the window mrs hatchard clutched at the door post well she gasped i d like to see the rooms said the other but you ain t a single young man said his wife recovering i m as good as single said mr hatchard i should say better you ain t young objected mrs hatchard i m three years younger than what you are said mr hatchard dispassionately his wife s lips tightened and her hand closed on the door mr hatchard put his foot in if you don t want lodgers why do you put a bill up he inquired i don t take the first that comes said his wife i ll pay a week in advance said mr hatchard putting his hand in his pocket of course if you re afraid of having me here afraid o giving way to tenderness i mean afraid choked mrs hatchard tenderness i i just a matter o business continued her husband that s my way of looking at it that s a man s way i s pose women are different they can t come in said mrs hatchard breathing hard mr hatchard obeyed and clapping a hand over his mouth ascended the stairs behind her at the top she threw open the door of a tiny bedroom and stood aside for him to enter mr hatchard sniffed critically smells rather stuffy he said at last you needn t have it said his wife abruptly there s plenty of other fish in the sea yes and i expect they d stay there if they saw this room said the other don t think i want you to have it because i don t said mrs hatchard making a preliminary movement to showing him downstairs they might suit me said mr hatchard musingly as he peeped in at the sitting room door i shouldn t be at home much i m a

mother had told to her when she herself was younger than little ernest a story not of things that were past but of what was yet to come a story nevertheless so very old that even the indians who formerly inhabited this valley had heard it from their forefathers to whom as they affirmed it had been murmured by the mountain streams and whispered by the wind among the tree tops the purport was that at some future day a child should be born hereabouts who was destined to become the greatest and noblest personage of his time and whose countenance in manhood should bear an exact resemblance to the great stone face not a few old fashioned people and young ones likewise in the ardor of their hopes still cherished an enduring faith in this old prophecy but others who had seen more of the world had watched and waited till they were weary and had beheld no man with such a face nor any man that proved to be much greater or nobler than his neighbors concluded it to be nothing but an idle tale at all events the great man of the prophecy had not yet appeared o mother dear mother cried ernest clapping his hands above his head i do hope that i shall live to see him his mother was an affectionate and thoughtful woman and felt that it was wisest not to discourage the generous hopes of her little boy so she only said to him perhaps you may and ernest never forgot the story that his mother told him it was always in his mind whenever he looked upon the great stone face he spent his childhood in the log cottage where he was born and was dutiful to his mother and helpful to her in many things assisting her much with his little hands and more with his loving heart in this manner from a happy yet often pensive child he grew up to be a mild quiet unobtrusive boy and sun browned with labor in the fields but with more intelligence brightening his aspect than is seen in many lads who have been taught at famous schools yet ernest had had no teacher save only that the great stone face became one to him when the toil of the day was over he would gaze at it for hours until he began to imagine that those vast features recognized him and gave him a smile of kindness and encouragement responsive to his own look of veneration we must not take upon us to affirm that this was a mistake although the face may have looked no more kindly at ernest than at all the world besides but the secret was that the boy s tender and confiding simplicity discerned what other people could not see and thus the love which was meant for all became his peculiar portion about this time there went a rumor throughout the valley that the great man foretold from ages long ago who was to bear a resemblance to the great stone face had appeared at last it seems that many years before a young man had migrated from the valley and settled at a distant seaport where after getting together a little money he had set up as a shopkeeper his name but i could never learn whether it was his real one or a nickname that had grown out of his habits and success in life was gathergold being shrewd and active and endowed by providence with that inscrutable faculty which develops itself in what the world calls luck he became an exceedingly rich merchant and owner of a whole fleet of bulky bottomed ships all the countries of the globe appeared to join hands for the mere purpose of adding heap after heap to the mountainous accumulation of this one man s wealth the cold regions of the north almost within the gloom and shadow of the arctic circle sent him their tribute in the shape of furs hot africa sifted for him the golden sands of her rivers and gathered up the ivory tusks of her great elephants out of the forests the east came bringing him the rich shawls and spices and teas and the effulgence of diamonds and the gleaming purity of large pearls the ocean not to be behindhand with the earth yielded up her mighty whales that mr gathergold might sell their oil and make a profit on it be the original commodity what it might it was gold within his grasp it might be said of him as of midas in the fable that whatever he touched with his finger immediately glistened and grew yellow and was changed at once into sterling metal or which suited him still better into piles of coin and when mr gathergold had become so very rich that it would have taken him a hundred years only to count his wealth he bethought himself of his native valley and resolved to go back thither and end his days where he was born with this purpose in view he sent a skilful architect to build him such a palace as should be fit for a man of his vast wealth to live in as i have said above it had already been rumored in the valley that mr gathergold had turned out to be the prophetic personage so long and vainly looked for and that his visage was the perfect and undeniable similitude of the great stone face people were the more ready to believe that this must needs be the fact when they beheld the splendid edifice that rose as if by enchantment on the site of his father s old weather beaten farmhouse the exterior was of marble so dazzlingly white that it seemed as though the whole structure might melt away in the sunshine like those humbler ones which mr gathergold in his young play days before his fingers were gifted with the touch of transmutation had been accustomed to build of snow it had a richly ornamented portico supported by tall pillars beneath which was a lofty door studded with silver knobs and made of a kind of variegated wood that had been brought from beyond the sea the windows from the floor to the ceiling of each stately apartment were composed respectively of but one enormous pane of glass so transparently pure that it was said,3

won t be in quite such a hurry to tell lies about me another time though i suppose that one must always expect a certain amount of lying from a half bred beggar like you like mother like son you know this last sentence was accompanied by a bitter laugh and produced a decided effect on the grovelling george who slowly raised himself upon his hands and lifting his head looked his cousin full in the face it was not the ghastly appearance of his mangled and blood soaked countenance that made philip recoil so sharply from the sight of his own handiwork he had fought too often at school to be chicken hearted about a little bloodshed and besides he knew that his cousin was only knocked about not really injured but rather the intense and almost devilish malignity of the expression that hovered on the blurred features and in the half closed eyes but no attempt was made by george to translate the look into words and indeed philip felt that it was untranslatable he also felt dimly that the hate and malice with which he was regarded by the individual at his feet was of a more concentrated and enduring character than most men have the power to originate in the lurid light of that one glance he was able though he was not very clever to pierce the darkest recesses of his cousin s heart and to see his inmost thought no longer through a veil but face to face and what he saw was sufficient to make the blood leave his ruddy cheek and to fix his eyes into an expression of fear next second george dropped his head on to the ground again and began to moan in an ostentatious manner possibly in order to attract some one whose footsteps could be plainly heard proceeding slowly down a shrubbery path on the other side of the yard wall at any rate that was the effect produced for next moment before philip could think of escape had he wished to escape a door in the wall was opened and a gentleman pausing on the threshold surveyed the whole scene with the assistance of a gold mounted eye glass with some evident surprise and little apparent satisfaction the old gentleman for he was old made so pretty a picture framed as he was in the arched doorway and set off by a natural background of varying shades of green that his general appearance is worth sketching as he stood to begin with he was dressed in the fashion of the commencement of this century and as has been said old though it was difficult to say how old indeed so vigorous and comparatively youthful was his bearing that he was generally taken to be considerably under seventy but as a matter of fact he was but a few years short of eighty he was extremely tall over six feet and stood upright as a lifeguardsman indeed his height and stately carriage would alone have made him a remarkable looking man had there been nothing else unusual about him but as it happened his features were as uncommon as his person they were clear cut and cast in a noble mould the nose was large and aquiline the chin like his son philip s square and determined but it was his eyes that gave a painful fascination to his countenance they were steely blue and glittered under the pent house of his thick eyebrows that in striking contrast to the snow white of his hair were black in hue as tempered steel glitters in a curtained room it was those eyes in conjunction with sundry little peculiarities of temper that had earned for the old man the title of devil caresfoot a sobriquet in which he took peculiar pride so pleased was he with it indeed that he caused it to be engraved in solid oak letters an inch long upon the form of a life sized and life like portrait of himself that hung over the staircase in the house i am determined he would say to his son to be known to my posterity as i was known to my contemporaries the picture represents my person not inaccurately from the nickname my descendants will be able to gather what the knaves and fools with whom i lived thought of my character ah boy i am wearing out people will soon be staring at that portrait and wondering if it was like me in a very few years i shall no longer be devil but devilled and he would chuckle at his grim and ill omened joke philip felt his father s eyes playing upon him and shrunk from them his face had at the mere thought of the consequences of his chastisement of his cousin lost the beauty and animation that had clothed it a minute before now it grew leaden and hard the good died away from it altogether and instead of a young god bright with vengeance there was nothing but a sullen youth with dull and frightened eyes to his son as to most people who came under his influence devil caresfoot was a grave reality presently the picture in the doorway opened its mouth and spoke in a singularly measured gentle voice you will forgive me philip for interrupting your tete a tete but may i ask what is the meaning of this philip returned no answer since your cousin is not in a communicative mood george perhaps you will inform me why you are lying on your face and groaning in that unpleasant and aggressive manner george lifted his blood stained face from the stones and looking at his uncle groaned louder than ever may i ask you philip if george has fallen down and hurt himself or if there has been an an altercation between you here george himself got up and before philip could make any reply addressed himself to his uncle sir he said i will answer for philip there has been an altercation and he in the scuffle knocked me down and i confess here he put his hand up to his battered face that i am suffering a good

perhaps we had better not go now just after he is tired with coming down said mrs wortley now mr arundel you will tell me honestly and this arrowroot will do just as well another time or if marian will carry home the message well said edmund smiling to give you a proof of my sincerity i think you had better perhaps go rather later in the day my uncle very unnecessarily hurried himself thinking that he was keeping me waiting to help him down stairs and i thought he seemed rather tired but he will be very glad to see you in the afternoon indeed he would be very glad now only you asked me as a question of prudence don t make civil speeches at the end to spoil just such a reply as i wanted said mrs wortley i am afraid you do not think sir edmund much better since you were last at home edmund

of the hand on rode the two cousins edmund and marian arundel what an excellent thing it is for the village that those wortleys are come said edmund yes now that mamma cannot attend much to the school and poor people i don t know what we should do without them how different it was in old mr may s time i hope we shall get the church set to rights now when papa is well enough to attend to it it is high time certainly said edmund our church is almost a disgrace to us especially with the arundel aisle to show what our ancestors did no not quite to us said marian you know papa would have done it all long ago if the idea had not vexed poor old mr may so much but ranger ranger where is ranger edmund edmund whistled and presently with whirring rushing wing there flew over the hedge beside them a covey of partridges followed by ranger s eager bark marian s pony started danced and capered edmund watched her with considerable anxiety but she reined it in with a steady dexterous though not a strong hand kept her seat well and rode on in triumph while edmund exclaimed capital marian then looking back what a shot that was he added in a sort of parenthesis continuing i am proud mayflower is not a bit too much for you now though i think we must have given her up if you had had another tumble oh no no i do so delight in mayflower pretty creature said marian patting her neck i like to feel that the creature i ride is alive not an old slug like that animal which you are upon edmund that is decidedly ungrateful of you marian when you learnt to ride upon this identical slug and owe the safety of your neck to its quiet propensities now take care down this stony hill hold her up well that is right care was certainly needed as they descended the steep hill side the road or rather pathway cut out between high steep limestone rocks and here and there even bare of earth any one but a native would have trembled at such a descent but though the cousins paid attention to their progress they had no doubts or alarms at the bottom a clear sparkling stream traversed the road where for the convenience of foot passengers a huge flat stone had been thrown across from one high bank to the other so as to form a romantic bridge marian however did not avail herself of it but rode gallantly through the shallow water only looking back at it to observe to edmund we must make a sketch of that some day or other i am afraid we cannot get far enough off said edmund to make a good drawing of it too many things go to the making of the picturesque yes i know but that is what i never can understand i see by woeful experience that what is pretty in itself will not make a pretty drawing and everyone says so but i never could find out why perhaps because we cannot represent it adequately yes but there is another puzzle you sometimes see an exact representation which is not really a picture at all don t you know that thing that the man who came to the door did of our house the trees all green and the sky all blue and the moors all purple as like as it can stare yes i know well why does that not satisfy us why is it not a picture because it stares i suppose why does not that picture of my aunt at mrs week s cottage satisfy you as well as the chalk sketch in the dining room because it has none of herself her spirit well i should say that nature has a self and a spirit which must be caught or else the chinese would be the greatest artists on the face of the earth yes but why does an archway or two trees standing up so as to enclose the landscape or or any of those things that do to put in the foreground why do they enable you to make a picture to catch this self and spirit make the phial to enclose the genie said edmund abstruse questions marian but perhaps it is because they contract the space so as to bring it more to the level of our capacity make it less grand and more what we can get into keeping to be sure he would be a presumptuous man who tried to make an exact likeness of that he added as they reached the top of the hill and found themselves on an open common with here and there a mass of rock peeping up but for the most part covered with

felt of it critically as if it belonged to somebody else and raised his eyes to his companion that ought to fetch it said tom in answer to the look ef it don t replied johnson doggedly with an air of relieving himself of all further responsibility in the matter it s got to thet s all if it referred to some change in the physiognomy of johnson it had probably been fetched by the process just indicated the head that went under the pump was large and clothed with bushy uncertain colored hair the face was flushed puffy and expressionless the eyes injected and full the head that came out from under the pump was of smaller size and different shape the hair straight dark and sleek the face pale and hollow cheeked the eyes bright and restless in the haggard nervous ascetic that rose from the horse trough there was very little trace of the bacchus that had bowed there a moment before familiar as tom must have been with the spectacle he could not help looking inquiringly at the trough as if expecting to see some traces of the previous johnson in its shallow depths a narrow strip of willow alder and buckeye a mere dusty ravelled fringe of the green mantle that swept the high shoulders of table mountain lapped the edge of the corral the silent pair were quick to avail themselves of even its scant shelter from the overpowering sun they had not proceeded far before johnson who was walking quite rapidly in advance suddenly brought himself up and turned to his companion with an interrogative eh i didn t speak said tommy quietly who said you spoke said johnson with a quick look of cunning in course you didn t speak and i didn t speak neither nobody spoke wot makes you think you spoke he continued peering curiously into tommy s eyes the smile which habitually shone there quickly vanished as the boy stepped quietly to his companion s side and took his arm without a word in course you didn t speak tommy said johnson deprecatingly you ain t a boy to go for to play an ole soaker

smoke before replying yes i was nearly fooled once let me tell you there was marvin fiske you remember him and his dantesque face and poet s soul singing his chant of the flesh the very priest of love and there was ethel baird whom also you must remember a warm saint i said that is she holy as love and sweeter just a woman made for love and yet how shall i say drenched through with holiness as your own air here is with the perfume of flowers well they married they played a hand with the gods and they won they gloriously won i broke in carquinez looked at me pityingly and his voice was like a funeral bell they lost they supremely colossally lost but the world believes otherwise i ventured coldly the world conjectures the world sees only the face of things but i know has it ever entered your mind to wonder why she took the veil buried herself in that dolorous convent of the living dead because she loved him so and when he died speech was frozen on my lips by carquinez s sneer a pat answer he said machine made like a piece of cotton drill the world s judgment and much the world knows about it like you she fled from life she was beaten she flung out the white flag of fatigue and no beleaguered city ever flew that flag in such bitterness and tears now i shall tell you the whole tale and you must believe me for i know they had pondered the problem of satiety they loved love they knew to the uttermost farthing the value of love they loved him so well that they were fain to keep him always warm and a thrill in their hearts they welcomed his coming they feared to have him depart love was desire they held a delicious pain he was ever seeking easement and when he found that for which he sought he died love denied was love alive love granted was love deceased do you follow me they saw it was not the way of life to be hungry for what it has to eat and still be hungry man has never accomplished that feat the problem of satiety that is it to have and to keep the sharp famine edge of appetite at the groaning board this was their problem for they loved love often did they discuss it with all love s sweet ardours brimming in their eyes his ruddy blood spraying their cheeks his voice playing in and out with their voices now hiding as a tremolo in their throats and again shading a tone with that ineffable tenderness which he alone can utter how do i know all this i saw much more i learned from her diary this i found in it from fiona macleod for truly that wandering voice that twilight whisper that breath so dewy sweet that flame winged lute player whom none sees but for a moment in a rainbow shimmer of joy or a sudden lightning flare of passion this exquisite mystery we call amor comes to some rapt visionaries at least not with a song upon the lips that all may hear or with blithe viol of public music but as one wrought by ecstasy dumbly eloquent with desire how to keep the flame winged lute player with his dumb eloquence of desire to feast him was to lose him their love for each other was a great love their granaries were overflowing with plenitude yet they wanted to keep the sharp famine edge of their love undulled nor were they lean little fledglings theorizing on the threshold of love they were robust and realized souls they had loved before with others in the days before they met and in those days they had throttled love with caresses and killed him with kisses and buried him in the pit of satiety they were not cold wraiths this man and woman they were warm human they had no saxon soberness in their blood the colour of it was sunset red they glowed with it temperamentally theirs was the french joy in the flesh they were idealists but their idealism was gallic it was not tempered by the chill and sombre fluid that for the english serves as blood there was no stoicism about them they were americans descended out of the english and yet the refraining and self denying of the english spirit groping were not theirs they were all this that i have said and they were made for joy only they achieved a concept a curse on concepts they played with logic and this was their logic but first let me tell you of a talk we had one night it was of gautier s madeline de maupin you remember the maid she kissed once and once only and kisses she would have no more not that she found kisses were not sweet but that she feared with repetition they would cloy satiety again she tried to play without stakes against the gods now this is contrary to a rule of the game the gods themselves have made only the rules are not posted over the table mortals must play in order to learn the rules well to the logic the man and the woman argued thus why kiss once only if to kiss once were wise was it not wiser to kiss not at all thus could they keep love alive fasting he would knock forever at their hearts perhaps it was out of their heredity that they achieved this unholy concept the breed will out and sometimes most fantastically thus in them did cursed albion array herself a scheming wanton a bold cold calculating and artful hussy after all i do not know but this i know it was out of their inordinate desire for joy that they forewent joy as he said i read it long afterward in one of his letters to her to hold you in my arms close and yet not close to yearn for you and never to have you and so always to have you and she for you to be always just beyond my reach to be ever attaining you and yet never attaining you and for this to last forever always fresh and new and always with the first flush upon us that is not the

resulted in his marrying the eldest daughter anne fraser she had spent some months at simon s bay while his ship was there and when he found himself under orders for the eastern coast of africa she would fain have awaited him at glen fraser but he preferred sending her home to fulfil the mission of daughterhood to his own mother the passage had been long and unfavourable and the consequences to her had been so serious that when she landed she could not travel until after a few days rest the marriage of the third son had been a much greater surprise compton poynsett was not a family living but the patron hearing of julius charnock as a hard working curate in a distant seaport wrote to offer it to him and the same letter to mrs poynsett to offer it to him and the same letter to mrs poynsett which conveyed this gratifying intelligence also informed her of his having proposed to the daughter of the commanding officer of the regiment stationed at the town where lay his present charge her father enjoyed the barren honours of the earldom of rathforlane an unimprovable estate in a remote corner of ireland burthened with successive families of numerous daughters so that he was forced to continue in the service and the marriage had been hastened by the embarkation of the regiment for india only two days later the rectory had however been found in such a state of dilapidation that demolition was the only cure and thus the reverend julius and lady rosamond charnock were to begin their married life in the family home the two youngest sons francis and charles stood on the

intended for the army and both had been reading with a tutor who lived at willansborough and was continually employed in cramming being reported of as the best coach in the country charlie however had passed a week previously and was to repair to sandhurst in another fortnight at half past four there was a light tap at mrs poynsett s door and charlie announced here s the first mother as he brought in a gray cloaked figure and mrs poynsett took a trembling hand and bestowed a kiss on a cheek which had languor and exhaustion in the very touch she was tired to death mother said charlie so we did not wait for the train quite right and as the newcomer sank into the chair he offered my dear you are sadly knocked up you were hardly fit to come thank you i am quite well answered the fagged timid voice hark as the crash of a peal of bells came up dear child you will like to rest before any fresh introductions you shall go to your room and have some tea there thank you charlie call susan she is

sentences as if constrained by the mother s anxious gaze and he was quite well when you parted with him quite ah you nursed my boy and we must nurse you for him thank you i am quite well but she bit her lip and spoke constrainedly as if too shy and reserved to give way to the rush of emotion but the coldness pained mrs poynsett whose expansiveness was easily checked and a brief silence was followed by charlie s return to report that he could not find nurse and thought she was out with the other servants watching for the arrival in another moment the approaching cheers caused him to rush out and after many more noises showing the excitement of the multitude and the advance of the bridal pair during which mrs poynsett lay with deepening colour and clasped hands her nostrils dilating with anxiety and suppressed eagerness there entered a tall dark sunburnt man bringing on his arm a little trim upright girlish figure and bending down he exclaimed there mother i ve brought her here s

illustration do you see anything queer about him he asked peter stared down the lone little path no he replied except that he seems in a great hurry that s just it jimmy returned promptly did you ever see him hurry unless he was frightened peter confessed that he never had well he isn t frightened now yet just look at him go retorted jimmy says he has got a beautiful voice and that he has to take part in the spring chorus at the smiling pool and that he is late peter looked very hard at jimmy to see if he was fooling or telling the truth then he began to laugh old mr toad sing the very idea he cried he can sing about as much as i can and that is not at all jimmy grinned i think he s crazy if you ask me said he and yet he was just as earnest about it as if it were really so i think he must have eaten something that has gone to his head there s unc billy possum over there let s ask him what he thinks so jimmy and peter joined unc billy and jimmy told the story about old mr toad all over again unc billy chuckled and laughed just as they had at the idea of old mr toad s saying he had a beautiful voice but unc billy has a shrewd little head on his shoulders after a few minutes he stopped laughing ah done learn a right smart long time ago that ah don know all there is to know about mah neighbors said he we uns done think of brer toad as ugly lookin fo so long that we uns may have overlooked something ah don reckon brer toad can sing but ah lows that perhaps he thinks he can what do you alls say to we uns going down to the smiling pool and finding out what he really is up to the very thing cried peter kicking up his heels you know peter is always ready to go anywhere or do anything that will satisfy his curiosity jimmy skunk thought it over for a few minutes and then he decided that as he hadn t anything in particular to do and as he might find some fat beetles on the way he would go too so off they started after old mr toad peter rabbit in the lead as usual unc billy possum next grinning as only he can grin and in the rear jimmy skunk taking his time and keeping a sharp eye out for fat beetles iii the hunt for old mr toad now though old mr toad was hurrying as fast as ever he could and was quite out of breath he wasn t getting along very fast compared with the way peter rabbit or jimmy skunk or unc billy possum could cover the ground you see he cannot make long jumps like his cousin grandfather frog but only little short hops so peter and jimmy and unc billy took their time about following him they stopped to hunt for fat beetles for jimmy skunk and at every little patch of sweet clover for peter rabbit to help himself once they wasted a lot of time while unc billy possum hunted for a nest of carol the meadow lark on the chance that he would find some fresh eggs there he didn t find the nest for the very good reason that carol hadn t built one yet peter was secretly glad you know he doesn t eat eggs and he is always sorry for his feathered friends when their eggs are stolen half way across the green meadows they stopped to play with the merry little breezes and because it was very pleasant there they played longer than they realized when at last they started on again old mr toad was out of sight you see all the time he had kept right on going hop hop hipperty hop never mind said peter we can catch up with him easy enough he s such a slow poke but even a slow poke who keeps right on doing a thing without wasting any time always gets somewhere sooner or later very often sooner than those who are naturally quicker but who waste their time so it was with old mr toad he kept right on hop hop hipperty hop while the others were playing and so it happened that when at last peter and jimmy and unc billy reached the smiling pool they hadn t caught another glimpse of old mr toad do you suppose he hid somewhere and we passed him asked peter unc billy shook his head ah don reckon so said he we uns done been foolin away our time an brer toad done stole a march on us ah reckons we uns will find him sittin on the bank here somewhere so right away the three separated to look for old mr toad all along the bank of the smiling pool they looked they peeped under old leaves and sticks they looked in every place where old mr toad might have hidden but not a trace of him did they find tra la la lee oka chee oka chee happy am i as i can be sang mr redwing as he swayed to and fro among the bulrushes say mr redwing have you seen old mr toad called peter rabbit no replied mr redwing is that whom you fellows are looking for i wondered if you had lost something what do you want with old mr toad peter explained how they had followed old mr toad just to see what he really was up to of course we know that he hasn t any more voice than i have declared peter but we are curious to know if he really thinks he has and why he should be in such a hurry to reach the smiling pool it looks to us as if the spring has made old mr toad crazy oh that s it is it replied mr redwing his bright eyes twinkling some people don t know as much as they might i ve been wondering where old mr toad was and i m ever so glad to

face means a good deal when you ve got your lungs full of that rotten gas and are feeling like nothing on earth i wonder where that idiot sandy is i told him to be here a quarter of an hour before you

streets and public places of london brave simple minded young men all of them with tangled recollections in their brains of blood and fire and hell and a game leg or a lost arm to remind them that the whole thing was not a nightmare he looked a little disconsolately around and was on the point of rejoining the others when the friend for whom he was searching came hurriedly through the turnstile doors sandy old chap holderness exclaimed with an air of relief here you are at last cheero dick was the light hearted reply fearfully sorry i m late but listen just listen for one moment the newcomer

loudly indeed it seemed to me which you would not like known across the north sea am i not right in a sense you are of course holderness admitted but here at henry s why the place is like a club where are the enemies ears to come from i should like to know where we least expect to find them as a rule was the grave reply quite right lutchester who had just rejoined them agreed they still say you

will be dangerous even now she is overloaded i looked at the man in amazement he had spoken earnestly but he was as calm as if we were standing on a sidewalk and he endeavoring to dissuade me from boarding an overcrowded street car before i could say anything he spoke again i am going to remain on this ship she is a hundred times safer than any of those boats i have had a great deal of experience in regard to vessels and ocean navigation and it will be a long time before this vessel sinks if she ever sinks of her own accord she s just as likely to float as that derelict we ran into the steam is nearly out of her boilers by this time and nothing is likely to happen to her i wish you would stay with me here we will be safe with plenty of room and plenty to eat and drink when it is daylight we will hoist a flag of distress which will be much more likely to be seen than anything that can flutter from those little boats if you have noticed sir the inclination of this deck is not greater now than it was half an hour ago that proves that our bow has settled down about as far as it is going i think it likely that the water has entered only a few of the forward compartments the man spoke so confidently that his words made an impression upon me i knew that it very often happens that a wreck floats for a long time and the boat from which the men were now frantically shouting for the captain would certainly be dangerously crowded stay with me said mr crowder and i assure you with as much reason as any man can assure any other man of anything in this world that you will be perfectly safe this steamer is not going to sink there were rapid footsteps and i saw the captain and his second officer approaching step back here said mr crowder pulling me by the coat don t let them see us they may drag us on board that confounded boat keep quiet sir and let them get off they think they are the last on board involuntarily i obeyed him and we stood in the shadow of the great funnel the captain had reached the rail is every one in the boats he shouted in french and in english is every one in the boats i am going to leave the vessel i made a start as if to rush toward him but crowder held me by the arm don t you do it he whispered very earnestly i have the greatest possible desire to save you stay where you are and you will be all right that overloaded boat may capsize in half an hour illustration don t you do it i could not help it i believed him my own judgment seemed suddenly to rise up and ask me why i should leave the solid deck of the steamer for that perilous little boat i need say but little more in regard to this shipwreck when the fog lifted about ten o clock in the morning we could see no signs of any of the boats a mile or so away lay the dull black line of the derelict as if she were some savage beast who had bitten and torn us and was now sullenly waiting to see us die of the wound we hoisted a flag union down and then we went below to get some breakfast mr crowder knew all about the ship and where to find everything he told me he had made so many voyages that he felt almost as much at home on sea as on land we made ourselves comfortable all day and at night we went to our rooms and i slept fairly well although there was a very disagreeable slant to my berth the next day early in the afternoon our signal of distress was seen by a tramp steamer on her way to new york and we were taken off we cruised about for many hours in the direction the boats had probably taken and the next day we picked up two of them in a sorry condition the occupants having suffered many hardships and privations we never had news of the captain s boat but the others were rescued by a sailing vessel going eastward before we reached new york mr crowder had made me promise that i would spend a few days with him at his home in that city his family was small he told me a wife and a daughter about six and he wanted me to know them naturally we had become great friends very likely the man had saved my life and he had done it without any act of heroism or daring but simply by impressing me with the fact that his judgment was better than mine i am apt to object to people of superior judgment but mr crowder was an exception to the ordinary superior person from the way he talked it was plain that he had much experience of various sorts and that he had greatly advantaged thereby but he gave himself no airs on this account and there was nothing patronizing about him if i were able to tell him anything he did not know and i frequently was he was very glad to hear it moreover mr crowder was a very good man to look at he was certainly over fifty and his closely trimmed hair was white but he had a fresh and florid complexion he was tall and well made fashionably dressed and had an erect and somewhat military carriage he was fond of talking and seemed fond of me and these points in his disposition attracted me very much my relatives were few they lived in the west and i never had had a friend whose company was so agreeable to me as that of mr crowder mr crowder s residence was a handsome house in the upper part of the city his wife was a slender lady scarcely half his age with a sweet and interesting face and was attired plainly but tastefully in general appearance she seemed to be the opposite of her husband in every way she had suffered a week of anxiety and was so rejoiced at having her husband again that when i met her some hours after crowder had reached the house her glorified face seemed like that of an angel but there

'InEngland204']",s wonderful that england should have produced byron it would have been wonderful if she had received any permanently deep impression from him or preserved a lasting appreciation of his work or cheerfully and intelligently recognised his immense force and accordingly we cannot help perceiving that generations are arising who know not byron this is not to say that he goes unread but there is a vast gulf fixed between the author whom we read with pleasure and even delight and that other to whom we turn at all moments for inspiration and encouragement and whose words and ideas spring up incessantly and animatingly within us unbidden whether we turn to him or no for no englishman now does byron hold this highest place and this is not unnatural in any way if we remember in what a different shape the revolution has now by change of circumstance and occasion come to present itself to those who are most ardent in the search after new paths an estimate of byron would be in some sort a measure of the distance that we have travelled within the last half century in our appreciation of the conditions of social change the modern rebel is at least half acquiescence he has developed a historic sense the most hearty aversion to the prolonged reign of some of the old gods does not hinder him from seeing that what are now frigid and unlovely blocks were full of vitality and light in days before the era of their petrifaction there is much less eagerness of praise or blame and much less faith in knife and cautery less confidence that new and right growth will naturally and necessarily follow upon demolition the revolution has never had that long hold on the national imagination in england either as an idol or a bugbear which is essential to keep the poet who sings it in effective harmony with new generations of readers more than this the byronic conception was as transitional and inadequate as the methods and ideas of the practical movers who were to a man left stranded in every country in europe during the period of his poetic activity a transitional and unstable movement of society inevitably fails to supply a propulsion powerful enough to make its poetic expression eternal there is no better proof of the enormous force of byron s genius than that it was able to produce so fine an expression of elements so intrinsically unfavourable to high poetry as doubt denial antagonism and weariness but this force was no guarantee for perpetuity of influence bare rebellion cannot endure and no succession of generations can continue nourishing themselves on the poetry of complaint and the idealisation of revolt if however it is impossible that byron should be all to us that he was to a former generation and if we find no direct guidance in his muse this is no reason why criticism should pass him over nor why there may not be something peculiarly valuable in the noble freedom and genuine modernism of his poetic spirit to an age that is apparently only forsaking the clerical idyll of one school for the reactionary medi valism or paganism intrinsically meaningless and issueless of another more attention is now paid to the mysteries of byron s life than to the merits of his work and criticism and morality are equally injured by the confusion between the worth of the verse he wrote and the virtue or wickedness of the life he lived the admirers of his poetry appear sensible of some obligation to be the champions of his conduct while those who have diligently gathered together the details of an accurate knowledge of the unseemliness of his conduct cannot bear to think that from this bramble men have been able to gather figs the result of the confusion has been that grave men and women have applied themselves to investigate and judge byron s private life as if the exact manner of it the more or less of his outrages upon decorum the degree of the deadness of his sense of moral responsibility were matter of minute and profound interest to all ages as if all this had anything to do with criticism proper it is right that we should know the life and manners of one whom we choose for a friend or of one who asks us to entrust him with the control of public interests in either of these two cases we need a guarantee for present and future art knows nothing of guarantees the work is before us its own warranty what is it to us whether turner had coarse orgies with the trulls of wapping we can judge his art without knowing or thinking of the artist and in the same way what are the stories of byron s libertinism to us they may have biographical interest but of critical interest hardly the least if the name of the author of manfred cain childe harold were already lost as it may be in remote times the work abides and its mark on european opinion je ne consid re les gens apr s leur mort said voltaire que par leurs ouvrages tout la reste est an anti pour moi there is a sense in which biographical detail gives light to criticism but not the sense in which the prurient moralist uses or seeks it the life of the poet may help to explain the growth and prominence of a characteristic sentiment or peculiar idea knowledge of this or that fact in his life may uncover the roots of something that strikes or unravel something that perplexes us considering the relations between a man s character and circumstance and what he produces we can from this point of view hardly know too much as to the personality of a great writer only let us recollect that this personality manifests itself outwardly in two separate forms in conduct and in literary production and that each of these manifestations is to be judged independently of the other if one of them is wholly censurable the other may still be the outcome of the better mind and even from the purely biographical aspect it is a plain injustice to insist on identifying a character with its worse,3

and at night retired to the domestic circle to ravel out some intricate accounts seated at his parlour table he ordered his wife and children out of the room and addressed himself to business while clambering wearily up a column of figures he felt upon his cheek the touch of something that seemed to cling clammily to the skin like the caress of a naked oyster thoughtfully setting down the result of his addition so far as he had proceeded with it he turned about and looked up i beg your pardon sir said he but you have not the advantage of my acquaintance why jake replied the apparition whom i

still there was something very important which had not been said and which mr croft very much wished to say before he left miss roberta that afternoon his only reason for hesitation was the fact that he did not know what he wished to say he was a man who always kept a lookout on the bows of his daily action in storm or in calm in fog or in bright sunshine that lookout must be at his post and upon his reports it depended whether mr croft set more sail put on more steam reversed his engine or anchored his vessel a report from this lookout was what he hoped to elicit by the remark which he wished to make he desired greatly to know whether miss roberta march looked upon him in the light of a lover or in that of an intimate acquaintance whose present intimacy depended a good deal upon the propinquity of midbranch and the green sulphur springs he had endeavored to produce upon her mind the latter impression if he ever wished her to regard him as a lover he could do this in the easiest and most straightforward way but the other procedure was much more difficult and he was not certain that he had succeeded in it how to find out in what light she viewed him without allowing the lady to perceive his purpose was a very delicate operation i wish said miss roberta poking with the end of her parasol at some half withered wild flowers which lay on the steps beneath her that you would change your mind and take supper with us mr croft s mind was very busy in endeavoring to think of some casual remark some observation regarding man nature or society or even an anecdote or historical incident which if brought into the conversation might produce upon the lady s countenance some shade of expression or some variation in her tone or words which would give him the information he sought for but what he said was are they really suppers that you have or are they only teas now i know said the lady why you have sometimes taken dinner with us but never supper you were afraid that it would be a tea lawrence croft was thinking that if this girl believed that he was in love with her it would make a great deal of difference in his present course of action if such were the case he ought not to come here so often or in fact he ought not to come at all until he had decided for himself what he was going to do but what could he say that would cause her for the briefest moment to unveil her

being ready to make such a remark he said i beg your pardon but do you really have suppers in the english fashion oh no answered miss roberta we don t have a great cold joint with old cheese and pitchers of brown stout and ale but neither do we content ourselves with thin bread and butter and preserves we have coffee as well as tea hot rolls fleecy and light hot batter bread made of our finest corn meal hot biscuits and stewed fruit with plenty of sweet milk and buttermilk and if anybody wants it he can always have a slice of cold ham if i could only feel sure thought mr croft that

advent of a meal of the out door enjoyment of a late afternoon or as we call it down here the evening it would be easy enough thought mr croft for me to say something about my being suddenly obliged to go away and then notice its effect upon her but apart from the fact that i would not do anything so vulgar and commonplace it would not advantage me in the slightest degree she would see through the flimsiness of my purpose and no matter how she looked upon me would show nothing but a well bred regret that i should be obliged to go away at such a pleasant season i think the hour for your

read our previous works will at once understand that the district to which we allude is that of which we have taken more than one occasion to write and we return to it now less with a desire to celebrate its charms than to exhibit them in a somewhat novel and yet perfectly historical aspect our own earlier labours will have told the reader that all of this extended district of country with the exception of belts of settlements along the two great rivers named was a wilderness anterior to the american revolution there was a minor class of exceptions to this general rule however to which it will be proper to advert lest by conceiving us too literally the reader may think he can convict us of a contradiction in order to be fully understood the explanations shall be given at a little length while it is true then that the mountainous region which now contains the counties of schoharie otsego chenango broome delaware c was a wilderness in the colonial governors had begun to make grants of its lands some twenty years earlier the patent of the estate on which we are writing lies before us and it bears the date of with an indian grant annexed that is a year or two older this may be taken as a mean date for the portion of country alluded to some of the deeds being older and others still more recent these grants of land were originally made subject to quit rents to the crown and usually on the payment of heavy fees to the colonial officers after going through the somewhat supererogatory duty of extinguishing the indian title as it was called the latter were pretty effectually extinguished in that day as well as in our own and it would be a matter of curious research to ascertain the precise nature of the purchase money given to the aborigines in the case of the patent before us the indian right was extinguished by means of a few rifles blankets kettles and beads though the grant covers a nominal hundred thousand and a real hundred and ten or twenty thousand acres of land the abuse of the grants as land became more valuable induced a law restricting the number of acres patented to any one person at any one time to a thousand our monarchical predecessors had the same facilities and it may be added the same propensities to rendering a law a dead letter as belongs to our republican selves the patent on our table being for a nominal hundred thousand acres contains the names of one hundred different grantees while three several parchment documents at its side each signed by thirty three of these very persons vest the legal estate in the first named for whose sole benefit the whole concession was made the dates of the last instruments succeeding by one or two days that of the royal patent itself such is the history of most of the original titles to the many estates that dotted the region we have described prior to the revolution money and favouritism however were not always the motives of these large concessions occasionally services presented their claims and many instances occur in which old officers of the army in particular received a species of reward by a patent for land the fees being duly paid and the indian title righteously extinguished these grants to ancient soldiers were seldom large except in the cases of officers of rank three or four thousand well selected acres being a sufficient boon to the younger sons of scottish lairds or english squires who had been accustomed to look upon a single farm as an estate as most of the soldiers mentioned were used to forest life from having been long stationed at frontier posts and had thus become familiarized with its privations and hardened against its dangers it was no unusual thing for them to sell out or go on half pay when the wants of a family began to urge their claims and to retire to their patents as the land itself as well as the instrument by which it was granted was invariably termed with a view of establishing themselves permanently as landlords these grants from the crown in the portions of the colony of new york that lie west of the river counties were generally if not invariably simple concessions of the fee subject to quit rents to the king and reservations of mines of the precious metals without any of the privileges of feudal seignory as existed in the older manors on the hudson on the islands and on the sound why this distinction was made it exceeds our power to say but that the fact was so as a rule we have it in proof by means of a great number of the original patents themselves that have been transmitted to us from various sources still the habits of home entailed the name even where the thing was not to be found titular manors exist in a few instances to this day where no manorial rights were ever granted and manor houses were common appellations for the residences of the landlords of large estates that were held in fee without any exclusive privileges and subject to the reservation named some of these manorial residences were of so primitive an appearance as to induce the belief that the names were bestowed in pleasantry the dwellings themselves being of logs with the bark still on them and the other fixtures to correspond notwithstanding all these drawbacks early impressions and rooted habits could easily transfer terms to such an abode and there was always a saddened enjoyment among these exiles when they could liken their forest names and usages to those they had left in the distant scenes of their childhood the effect of the different causes we have here given was to dot the region described though at long intervals with spots of a semi civilized appearance in the midst of the vast nay almost boundless expanse of forest some of these early settle,3

need not dwell here upon this aspect of the case because it is one with which since the publication of the descent of man all the world has been sufficiently familiar in our own species the selective

personal traits and minor peculiarities it is furthermore exerted to a far greater extent upon mental and moral as well as physical peculiarities in the individual we cannot fall in love with everybody alike some of us fall in love with one person some with another this instinctive and deep seated differential feeling we may regard as the outcome of complementary features mental moral or physical in the two persons concerned and experience shows us that in nine cases out of ten it is a reciprocal affection that is to say in other words an affection roused in unison by varying qualities in the respective individuals of its eminently conservative and even upward tendency very little doubt can be reasonably entertained we do fall in love taking us in the lump with the young the beautiful the strong and the healthy we do not fall in love taking us in the lump with the aged the ugly the feeble and the sickly the prohibition of the church is scarcely needed to prevent a man from marrying his grandmother moralists have always borne a special grudge to pretty faces but as mr herbert spencer admirably put it long before the appearance of darwin s selective theory the saying that beauty is but skin deep is itself but a skin deep saying in reality beauty is one of the very best guides we can possibly have to the desirability so far as race preservation is concerned of any man or any woman as a partner in marriage a fine form a good figure a beautiful bust a round arm and neck a fresh complexion a lovely face are all outward and visible signs of the physical qualities that on the whole conspire to make up a healthy and vigorous wife and mother they imply soundness fertility a good circulation a good digestion conversely sallowness and paleness are roughly indicative of dyspepsia and an mia a flat chest is a symptom of deficient maternity and what we call a bad figure is really in one way or another an unhealthy departure from the central norma and standard of the race good teeth mean good deglutition a clear eye means an active liver scrubbiness and undersizedness mean feeble virility nor are indications of mental and moral efficiency by any means wanting as recognised elements in personal beauty a good humoured face is in itself almost pretty a pleasant smile half redeems unattractive features low receding foreheads strike us unfavourably heavy stolid half idiotic countenances can never be beautiful however regular their lines and contours intelligence and goodness are almost as necessary as health and vigour in order to make up our perfect ideal of a beautiful human face and figure the apollo belvedere is no fool the murderers in the chamber of horrors at madame tussaud s are for the most part no beauties what we all fall in love with then as a race is in most cases efficiency and ability what we each fall in love with individually is i believe our moral mental and physical complement not our like not our counterpart quite the contrary within healthy limits our unlike and our opposite that this is so has long been more or less a commonplace of ordinary conversation that it is scientifically true one time with another when we take an extended range of cases may i think be almost demonstrated by sure and certain warranty of human nature brothers and sisters have more in common mentally and physically than any other members of the same race can possibly have with one another but nobody falls in love with his sister a profound instinct has taught even the lower races of men for the most part to avoid such union of the all but identical in the higher races the idea never so much as occurs to us even cousins seldom fall in love seldom that is to say in comparison with the frequent opportunities of intercourse they enjoy relatively to the remainder of general society when they do and when they carry out their perilous choice effectively by marriage natural selection soon avenges nature upon the offspring by cutting off the idiots the consumptives the weaklings and the cripples who often result from such consanguineous marriages in narrow communities where breeding in and in becomes almost inevitable natural selection has similarly to exert itself upon a crowd of cr tins and other hapless incapables but in wide and open champaign countries where individual choice has free room for exercise men and women as a rule if not constrained by parents and moralists marry for love and marry on the whole their natural complements they prefer outsiders fresh blood somebody who comes from beyond the community to the people of their own immediate surroundings in many men the dislike to marrying among the folk with whom they have been brought up amounts almost to a positive instinct they feel it as impossible to fall in love with a fellow townswoman as to fall in love with their own first cousins among exogamous tribes such an instinct aided of course by other extraneous causes has hardened into custom and there is reason to believe from the universal traces among the higher civilisations of marriage by capture that all the leading races of the world are ultimately derived from exogamous ancestors possessing this healthy and excellent sentiment in minor matters it is of course universally admitted that short men as a rule prefer tall women while tall men admire

see him hurry unless he was frightened peter confessed that he never had well he isn t frightened now yet just look at him go retorted jimmy says he has got a beautiful voice and that he has to take part in the spring chorus at the smiling pool and that he is late peter looked very hard at jimmy to see if he was fooling or telling the truth then he began to laugh old mr toad sing the very idea he cried he can sing about as much as i can and that is not at all jimmy grinned i think he s crazy if you ask me said he and yet he was just as earnest about it as if it were really so i think he must have eaten something that has gone to his head there s unc billy possum over there let s ask him what he thinks so jimmy and peter joined unc billy and jimmy told the story about old mr toad all over again unc billy chuckled and laughed just as they had at the idea of old mr toad s saying he had a beautiful voice but unc billy has a shrewd little head on his shoulders after a few minutes he stopped laughing ah done learn a right smart long time ago that ah don know all there is to know about mah neighbors said he we uns done think of brer toad as ugly lookin fo so long that we uns may have overlooked something ah don reckon brer toad can sing but ah lows that perhaps he thinks he can what do you alls say to we uns going down to the smiling pool and finding out what he really is up to the very thing cried peter kicking up his heels you know peter is always ready to go anywhere or do anything that will satisfy his curiosity jimmy skunk thought it over for a few minutes and then he decided that as he hadn t anything in particular to do and as he might find some fat beetles on the way he would go too so off they started after old mr toad peter rabbit in the lead as usual unc billy possum next grinning as only he can grin and in the rear jimmy skunk taking his time and keeping a sharp eye out for fat beetles iii the hunt for old mr toad now though old mr toad was hurrying as fast as ever he could and was quite out of breath he wasn t getting along very fast compared with the way peter rabbit or jimmy skunk or unc billy possum could cover the ground you see he cannot make long jumps like his cousin grandfather frog but only little short hops so peter and jimmy and unc billy took their time about following him they stopped to hunt for fat beetles for jimmy skunk and at every little patch of sweet clover for peter rabbit to help himself once they wasted a lot of time while unc billy possum hunted for a nest of carol the meadow lark on the chance that he would find some fresh eggs there he didn t find the nest for the very good reason that carol hadn t built one yet peter was secretly glad you know he doesn t eat eggs and he is always sorry for his feathered friends when their eggs are stolen half way across the green meadows they stopped to play with the merry little breezes and because it was very pleasant there they played longer than they realized when at last they started on again old mr toad was out of sight you see all the time he had kept right on going hop hop hipperty hop never mind said peter we can catch up with him easy enough he s such a slow poke but even a slow poke who keeps right on doing a thing without wasting any time always gets somewhere sooner or later very often sooner than those who are naturally quicker but who waste their time so it was with old mr toad he kept right on hop hop hipperty hop while the others were playing and so it happened that when at last peter and jimmy and unc billy reached the smiling pool they hadn t caught another glimpse of old mr toad do you suppose he hid somewhere and we passed him asked peter unc billy shook his head ah don reckon so said he we uns done been foolin away our time an brer toad done stole a march on us ah reckons we uns will find him sittin on the bank here somewhere so right away the three separated to look for old mr toad all along the bank of

preparation is as necessary as literary preparation there is no necessity that the business should be on any majestic and imperial scale to be a guardian of the poor in an east end parish to be behind the scenes of some great strike of labour to be an active member of the parliamentary committee of a trades council or of the executive committee of a union or a league may be quite as instructive discipline as participation in mightier scenes those who write concrete history without ever having taken part in practical politics are one might say in the position of those ancients who wrote about the human body without ever having effectively explored it by dissection mr carlyle it is true by force of penetrating imaginative genius has reproduced in stirring and resplendent dithyrambs the fire and passion the rage and tears the many tinted dawn and the blood red sunset of the french revolution and the more a man learns about the details of the revolution the greater is his admiration for mr carlyle s magnificent performance but it is dramatic presentation not social analysis a masterpiece of literature not a scientific investigation a prodigy of poetic insight not a sane and quantitative exploration of the complex processes the deep lying economical fiscal and political conditions that prepared so immense an explosion we have to remember it is true that m taine is not professing to write a history in the ordinary sense his book lies if we may use two very pompous but indispensable words partly in the region of historiography but much more in the region of sociology the study of the french revolution cannot yet be a history of the past for the french still walk per ignes suppositos and the revolution is still some way from being fully accomplished it was the disputes between the roman and the reformed churches which inspired historical research in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries it is the disputes among french parties that now inspire what professes to be historiography but what is really a sort of experimental investigation in the science of society they little know how long and weary a journey lies before them said burke who undertake to bring great masses of men into the political unity of a nation the process is still going on and a man of m taine s lively intellectual sensibility can no more escape its influences than he can escape the ingredients of the air he breathes we may add that if his work had been really historic he must inevitably have gone further back than the eighteenth century for the origins of contemporary france the very slight vague and unsubstantial chapter with which he opens his work cannot be accepted as a substitute for what the subject really demanded a serious summary however condensed and rapid of the various forces accidents deliberate lines of policy which from the breaking up of the great fiefs down to the death of lewis the fourteenth had prepared the distractions of the monarchy under lewis s descendants full of interest as it is m taine s book can hardly be described as containing much that is new or strikingly significant he develops one idea indeed which we have never before seen stated in its present form but which if it implies more than has been often advanced by previous writers in other forms cannot be accepted as true this is perhaps a point better worth discussing than any other which his book raises the rest is a very elaborate and thorough description of the structure of society of its physiognomy in manners and characteristics the privileges the burdens the daily walk and conversation of the various classes which made up the french people between the regency and the revolution m taine s method of description does not strike one as altogether happy it is a common complaint against french historians that they are too lax about their authorities and too heedless about giving us chapter and verse for their assertions m taine goes to the contrary extreme and pours his note books into his text with a steady handed profusion that is excessively fatiguing and makes the result far less effective than it would have been if all this industrious reading had been thoroughly fused and recast into a homogeneous whole it is an ungenerous trick of criticism to disparage good work by comparing it with better but the reader can scarcely help contrasting m taine s overcrowded pages with the perfect assimilation the pithy fulness the pregnant meditation of de tocqueville s book on the same subject when we attempt to reduce m taine s chapters to a body of propositions standing out in definite relief from one another yet conveying a certain unity of interpretation we soon feel how possible it is for an author to have literary clearness along with historic obscurity in another respect we are inclined to question the felicity of m taine s method it does not convey the impression of movement the steps and changes in the conflict among the organs of the old society are not marked in their order and succession the reader is not kept alive to the gradual progress of the break up of old institutions and ideas the sense of an active and ceaseless struggle extending in various stages across the century is effaced by an exclusive attention to the social details of a given phase we need the story you cannot effectively reproduce the true sense and significance of such an epoch as the eighteenth century in france without telling us however barely the tale for example of the long battle of the ecclesiastical factions and the yet more important series of battles between the judiciary and the crown if m taine s book were a piece of abstract social analysis the above remark would not be true but it is a study of the concrete facts of french life and society,3

of the gate he is too far away for mother to call and besides i think she must have been a little uncertain for he did not so much as turn his head toward the house trembling with excitement she hurries little frank into his wagon and telling hattie to bring me sets off up the road as fast as she can draw the baby s cart it all seems a dream to me and i move dumbly almost stupidly like one in a mist we did not overtake the soldier that is evident for my next vision is that of a blue coated figure leaning upon the fence studying with intent gaze our empty cottage i cannot even now precisely divine why he stood thus sadly contemplating his silent home but so it was his knapsack lay at his feet his musket was propped against a post on whose top a cat was dreaming unmindful of the warrior and his folded hands he did not hear us until we were close upon him and even after he turned my mother hesitated so thin so hollow eyed so changed was he richard is that you she quaveringly asked his worn face lighted up his arms rose yes belle here i am he answered nevertheless though he took my mother in his arms i could not relate him to the father i had heard so much about to me he was only a strange man with big eyes and care worn face i did not recognize in him anything i had ever known but my sister who was two years older than i went to his bosom of her own motion she knew him whilst i submitted to his caresses rather for the reason that my mother urged me forward than because of any affection i felt for him frank however would not even permit a kiss the gaunt and grizzled stranger terrified him come here my little man my father said my little man across the space of half a century i can still hear the sad reproach in his voice won t you come and see your poor old father when he comes home from the war my little man how significant that phrase seems to me now the war had in very truth come between this patriot and his sons i had forgotten him the baby had never known him frank crept beneath the rail fence and stood there well out of reach like a cautious kitten warily surveying an alien dog at last the soldier stooped and drawing from his knapsack a big red apple held it toward the staring babe confidently calling now i guess he ll come to his poor old pap home from the war the mother apologized he doesn t know you dick how could he he was only nine months old when you went away he ll go to you by and by the babe crept slowly toward the shining lure my father caught him despite his kicking and hugged him close now i ve got you he exulted then we all went into the little front room and the soldier laid off his heavy army shoes my mother brought a pillow to put under his head and so at last he stretched out on the floor the better to rest his tired aching bones and there i joined him oh belle he said in tones of utter content this is what i ve dreamed about a million times frank and i grew each moment more friendly and soon began to tumble over him while mother hastened to cook something for him to eat he asked for hot biscuits and honey and plenty of coffee that was a mystic hour and yet how little i can recover of it the afternoon glides into evening while the soldier talks and at last we all go out to the barn to watch mother milk the cow i hear him ask about the crops the neighbors the sunlight passes mother leads the way back to the house my father follows carrying little frank in his arms he is a strange man no longer each moment his voice sinks deeper into my remembrance he is my father that i feel ringing through the dim halls of my consciousness harriet clings to his hand in perfect knowledge and confidence we eat our bread and milk the trundle bed is pulled out we children clamber in and i go to sleep to the music of his resonant voice recounting the story of the battles he had seen and the marches he had made the emergence of an individual consciousness from the void is after all the most amazing fact of human life and i should like to spend much of this first chapter in groping about in the luminous shadow of my infant world because deeply considered childish impressions are the fundamentals upon which an author s fictional out put is based but to linger might weary my reader at the outset although i count myself most fortunate in the fact that my boyhood was spent in the midst of a charming landscape and during a certain heroic era of western settlement the men and women of that far time loom large in my thinking for they possessed not only the spirit of adventurers but the courage of warriors aside from the natural distortion of a boy s imagination i am quite sure that the pioneers of still retained something broad and fine in their action something a boy might honorably imitate the earliest dim scene in my memory is that of a soft warm evening i am cradled in the lap of my sister harriet who is sitting on the door step beneath a low roof it is mid summer and at our feet lies a mat of dark green grass from which a frog is croaking the stars are out and above the high hills to the east a mysterious glow is glorifying the sky the cry of the small animal at last conveys to my sister s mind a notion of distress and rising she peers closely along the path starting back with a cry of alarm she calls and my mother hurries out she too examines the ground and at last points out to me a long striped snake with a poor shrieking little tree toad in its mouth the horror of this scene fixes it in my mind my mother beats the serpent with a stick the mangled victim hastens away and

egerton i am sorry to say major that these anticipations were very speedily verified as you know the advance party landed at aptee on november rd and seized the roads over the gorge and on the th the main body disembarked at panwell no sooner had they got there than there was a quarrel between egerton and carnac most unfortunately mostyn who would have acted as mediator was taken ill on the very day after landing and was obliged to return to bombay and i hear there is hardly any chance of his recovery the army did not reach the top of the ghauts till the rd of december instead of at the latest three days after landing and actually spent eleven days before it arrived at karlee only eight miles in advance of the bhore ghauts of course this encouraged the enemy and gave plenty of time for them to assemble and make all their arrangements and when we last heard they were harassing our march for the past two days no news has arrived and there seems to be little doubt that the mahrattas have closed in round their rear and cut off all communications it is monstrous that they should march so slowly the whole thing has been a hideous blunder and the idea of encumbering a force of four thousand men with something like thirty thousand camp followers and with a train of no less than nineteen thousand bullocks to say nothing of other draught animals is the most preposterous thing i ever heard of in fact the whole thing has been grossly mismanaged i don t say that the conduct of the mahrattas has not for some time been doubtful if not threatening it is well known that the governor general and the council at calcutta have most strongly disapproved of the whole conduct of the council at bombay indeed no explanation has ever been given as to why they took up the cause of rugoba the scoundrel who grasped the crown and who was privy to if he did not instigate the murder of his nephew the young peishwa he was not unopposed for nana furnuwees and hurry punt two of the leading mahratta ministers formed a regency under gunga bye the widow of the murdered peishwa while matters were undecided the bombay council opened communications with rugoba who they thought was likely to be successful and promised to assist him if he would advance a considerable sum of money and cede to the company salsette the small islands contiguous to bombay and bassein which had been captured from the portuguese by the mahrattas an altogether inexcusable arrangement as the mahrattas were at peace with us and rugoba was not in a position to hand the islands over that matter however was settled by sending an expedition which captured salsette and tannah in four years ago since then rugoba has become a fugitive and without a shadow of reason is making war against the whole force of the mahratta confederacy who although divided amongst themselves and frequently engaged in the struggles for supremacy have united against us for they say that scindia holkar and hurry punt are in command of their army to send four thousand men of whom less than six hundred are europeans against the whole mahratta power is a desperate step i know we have fought and won against greater odds many times in the history of india but our forces have always been well led marched with the smallest amount of baggage possible and made up for inferiority in numbers by speed activity and dash here on the contrary we have a force hampered to an unheard of degree by baggage and camp followers with an invalid at its head controlled by two civilians and moving at a rate which in itself testifies to divided councils and utter incompetency on the part of its commander it is almost impossible even to hope for success under such conditions the lookout is certainly bad the younger officer agreed however before now the fighting powers of the british soldier have made up for the blunders of his commanders and we may hope that this will be the case now if a disaster happen the major said we shall have the mahrattas down at the gates of bombay and as soon as i hear a rumour of it and news travels wonderfully fast among the natives i shall return to the city oh i don t think you need fear anything of that sort major besides this is not on the direct line between the ghauts and the city and even if they find they cannot push on i should say our force would be able to secure their retreat the mahratta horse will never be able to break our squares but of course in that case we should have to abandon all our baggage and baggage animals i agree with you that the mahrattas would doubtless hang on the skirts of our force and follow them down the bhore ghaut and so would not come anywhere near us but they might detach flying parties to burn and plunder as is their custom brave as they are the mahrattas do not fight for the love of fighting but simply from the hope of plunder and of enlarging their territories well we may hope in a day or two to hear that a battle has been fought and that a victory has been won not that one victory would settle the matter for the mahratta force consists almost entirely of cavalry and as we have only a handful they would if beaten simply ride off and be ready to fight again another day if we had pushed on and occupied poona directly we landed which should have been easy enough if the baggage train had been left behind for it is but forty miles from panwell to the mahratta capital the position would have been altogether different the mahrattas would not have had time to collect their forces and we should probably have met with no opposition and once in poona could have held it against the whole mahratta force besides it is certain that some of the chiefs seeing that rugoba was likely,3

ass not much bigger than a dog the colour of a mouse with a kindly eye and a determined under jaw there was something neat and high bred a quakerish elegance about the rogue that hit my fancy on the spot our first interview was in monastier market place to prove her good temper one child after another was set upon her back to ride and one after another went head over heels into the air until a want of confidence began to reign in youthful bosoms and the experiment was discontinued from a dearth of subjects i was already backed by a deputation of my friends but as if this were not enough all the buyers and sellers came round and helped me in the bargain and the ass and i and father adam were the centre of a hubbub for near half an hour at length she passed into my service for the consideration of sixty five francs and a glass of brandy the sack had already cost eighty francs and two glasses of beer so that modestine as i instantly baptized her was upon all accounts the cheaper article indeed that was as it should be for she was only an appurtenance of my mattress or self acting bedstead on four castors i had a last interview with father adam in a billiard room at the witching hour of dawn when i administered the brandy he professed himself greatly touched by the separation and declared he had often bought white bread for the donkey when he had been content with black bread for himself but this according to the best authorities must have been a flight of fancy he had a name in the village for brutally misusing the ass yet it is certain that he shed a tear and the tear made a clean mark down one cheek by the advice of a fallacious local saddler a leather pad was made for me with rings to fasten on my bundle and i thoughtfully completed my kit and arranged my toilette by way of armoury and utensils i took a revolver a little spirit lamp and pan a lantern and some halfpenny candles a jack knife and a large leather flask the main cargo consisted of two entire changes of warm clothing besides my travelling wear of country velveteen pilot coat and knitted spencer some books and my railway rug which being also in the form of a bag made me a double castle for cold nights the permanent larder was represented by cakes of chocolate and tins of bologna sausage all this except what i carried about my person was easily stowed into the sheepskin bag and by good fortune i threw in my empty knapsack rather for convenience of carriage than from any thought that i should want it on my journey for more immediate needs i took a leg of cold mutton a bottle of beaujolais an empty bottle to carry milk an egg beater and a considerable quantity of black bread and white like father adam for myself and donkey only in my scheme of things the destinations were reversed monastrians of all shades of thought in politics had agreed in threatening me with many ludicrous misadventures and with sudden death in many surprising forms cold wolves robbers above all the nocturnal practical joker were daily and eloquently forced on my attention yet in these vaticinations the true patent danger was left out like christian it was from my pack i suffered by the way before telling my own mishaps let me in two words relate the lesson of my experience if the pack is well strapped at the ends and hung at full length not doubled for your life across the pack saddle the traveller is safe the saddle will certainly not fit such is the imperfection of our transitory life it will assuredly topple and tend to overset but there are stones on every roadside and a man soon learns the art of correcting any tendency to overbalance with a well adjusted stone on the day of my departure i was up a little after five by six we began to load the donkey and ten minutes after my hopes were in the dust the pad would not stay on modestine s back for half a moment i returned it to its maker with whom i had so contumelious a passage that the street outside was crowded from wall to wall with gossips looking on and listening the pad changed hands with much vivacity perhaps it would be more descriptive to say that we threw it at each other s heads and at any rate we were very warm and unfriendly and spoke with a deal of freedom i had a common donkey pack saddle a barde as they call it fitted upon modestine and once more loaded her with my effects the doubled sack my pilot coat for it was warm and i was to walk in my waistcoat a great bar of black bread and an open basket containing the white bread the mutton and the bottles were all corded together in a very elaborate system of knots and i looked on the result with fatuous content in such a monstrous deck cargo all poised above the donkey s shoulders with nothing below to balance on a brand new pack saddle that had not yet been worn to fit the animal and fastened with brand new girths that might be expected to stretch and slacken by the way even a very careless traveller should have seen disaster brewing that elaborate system of knots again was the work of too many sympathisers to be very artfully designed it is true they tightened the cords with a will as many as three at a time would have a foot against modestine s quarters and be hauling with clenched teeth but i learned afterwards that one thoughtful person without any exercise of force can make a more solid job than half a dozen heated and enthusiastic grooms i was then but a novice even after the misadventure of the pad nothing could disturb my security and i went forth from the stable door as an

one of the hoary youths who play falstaff to every fresh heir s prince harry he was a middle aged man too obviously accustomed to the society of boys his very dress spoke of a prolonged youth x large cat s eye circled with diamonds blazed solitary in his shirt front and his coat was cut after the manner of the contemporary reveller his chin was clean shaven and his face though a good deal worn was ripe smooth shining with good cheer and of a purply bronze hue from exposure to hot suns and familiarity with the beverages of many peoples his full red lips with their humorous corners were shaded by a small black mustache and his twinkling bistre colored eyes beneath mobile black eyebrows gave cranley the air of a jester and a good fellow in manner he was familiar with a kind of deference too and reserve like a dog that is always wagging his tail and deprecating a kick thought barton grimly as he watched the other s genial advance he s going to say good night bless him thought maitland

anything more elevating than loo i m afraid i am no good at a round game answered maitland who had played at his aunt s at christmas and who now observed with delight that everyone was moving but here

club was familiarly called by its friends and enemies two young merton men and the freshman from new who were enjoying their christmas vacation in town and had been dining with maitland were a little disappointed in the appearance of the place they had hoped to knock mysteriously at a back door in a lane and to be shown after investigating through a loopholed wicket into a narrow staircase which

the captain nodded to the sergeant the sergeant stepped aside ii peyton farquhar was a well to do planter of an old and highly respected alabama family being a slave owner and like other slave owners a politician he was naturally an original secessionist and ardently devoted to the southern cause circumstances of an imperious nature which it is unnecessary to relate here had prevented him from taking service with that gallant army which had fought the disastrous campaigns ending with the fall of corinth and he chafed under the inglorious restraint longing for the release of his energies the larger life of the soldier the opportunity for distinction that opportunity he felt would come as it comes to all in wartime meanwhile he did what he could no service was too humble for him to perform in the aid of the south no adventure to perilous for him to undertake if consistent with the character of a civilian who was at heart a soldier and who in good faith and without too much qualification assented to at least a part of the frankly villainous dictum that all is fair in love and war one evening while farquhar and his wife were sitting on a rustic bench near the entrance to his grounds a gray clad soldier rode up to the gate and asked for a drink of water mrs farquhar was only too happy to serve him with her own white hands while she was fetching the water her husband approached the dusty horseman and inquired eagerly for news from the front the yanks are repairing the railroads said the man and are getting ready for another advance they have reached the owl creek bridge put it in order and built a stockade on the north bank the commandant has issued an order which is posted everywhere declaring that any civilian caught interfering with the railroad its bridges tunnels or trains will be summarily hanged i saw the order how far is it to the owl creek bridge farquhar asked about thirty miles is there no force on this side of the creek only a picket post half a mile out on the railroad and a single sentinel at this end of the bridge suppose a man a civilian and student of hanging should elude the picket post and perhaps get the better of the sentinel said farquhar smiling what could he accomplish the soldier reflected i was there a month ago he replied i observed that the flood of last winter had lodged a great quantity of driftwood against the wooden pier at this end of the bridge it is now dry and would burn like tinder the lady had now brought the water which the soldier drank he thanked her ceremoniously bowed to her husband and rode away an hour later after nightfall he repassed the plantation going northward in the direction from which he had come he was a federal scout iii as peyton farquhar fell straight downward through the bridge he lost consciousness and was as one already dead from this state he was awakened ages later it seemed to him by the pain of a sharp pressure upon his throat followed by a sense of suffocation keen poignant agonies seemed to shoot from his neck downward through every fiber of his body and limbs these pains appeared to flash along well defined lines of ramification and to beat with an inconceivably rapid periodicity they seemed like streams of pulsating fire heating him to an intolerable temperature as to his head he was conscious of nothing but a feeling of fullness of congestion these sensations were unaccompanied by thought the intellectual part of his nature was already effaced he had power only to feel and feeling was torment he was conscious of motion encompassed in a luminous cloud of which he was now merely the fiery heart without material substance he swung through unthinkable arcs of oscillation like a vast pendulum then all at once with terrible suddenness the light about him shot upward with the noise of a loud splash a frightful roaring was in his ears and all was cold and dark the power of thought was restored he knew that the rope had broken and he had fallen into the stream there was no additional strangulation the noose about his neck was already suffocating him and kept the water from his lungs to die of hanging at the bottom of a river the idea seemed to him ludicrous he opened his eyes in the darkness and saw above him a gleam of light but how distant how inaccessible he was still sinking for the light became fainter and fainter until it was a mere glimmer then it began to grow and brighten and he knew that he was rising toward the surface knew it with reluctance for he was now very comfortable to be hanged and drowned he thought that is not so bad but i do not wish to be shot no i will not be shot that is not fair he was not conscious of an effort but a sharp pain in his wrist apprised him that he was trying to free his hands he gave the struggle his attention as an idler might observe the feat of a juggler without interest in the outcome what splendid effort what magnificent what superhuman strength ah that was a fine endeavor bravo the cord fell away his arms parted and floated upward the hands dimly seen on each side in the growing light he watched them with a new interest as first one and then the other pounced upon the noose at his neck they tore it away and thrust it fiercely aside its undulations resembling those of a water snake put it back put it back he thought he shouted these words to his hands for the undoing of the noose had been succeeded by the direst pang that he had yet experienced his neck ached horribly his brain was on fire his heart which had been fluttering faintly gave a great leap trying to force

colonel repington and dr conan doyle and anticipating the arrival of mr harold cox so we pass mostly in automobiles that bump tremendously over war roads a cloud of witnesses each testifying after his manner whatever else has happened we have all been photographed with invincible patience and resolution under the direction of colonel barberich in a sunny little court in udine my own manner of testifying must be to tell what i have seen and what i have thought during this extraordinary experience it has been my natural disposition to see this war as something purposeful and epic as it is great as an epoch as the war that will end war but of that last more anon i do not think i am alone in this inclination to a dramatic and logical interpretation the caricatures in the french shops show civilisation and particularly marianne in conflict with a huge and hugely wicked hindenburg ogre well i come back from this tour with something not so simple as that if i were to be tied down to one word for my impression of this war i should say that this war is queer it is not like anything in a really waking world but like something in a dream it hasn t exactly that clearness of light against darkness or of good against ill but it has the quality of wholesome instinct struggling under a nightmare the world is not really awake this vague appeal for explanations to all sorts of people this desire to exhibit the business to get something in the way of elucidation at present missing is extraordinarily suggestive of the efforts of the mind to wake up that will sometimes occur at a deep crisis my memory of this tour i have just made is full of puzzled looking men i have seen thousands of poilus sitting about in cafes by the roadside in tents in trenches thoughtful i have seen alpini sitting restfully and staring with speculative eyes across the mountain gulfs towards unseen and unaccountable enemies i have seen trainloads of wounded staring out of the ambulance train windows as we passed i have seen these dim intimations of questioning reflection in the strangest juxtapositions in malagasy soldiers resting for a spell among the big shells they were hoisting into trucks for the front in a couple of khaki clad maoris sitting upon the step of a horse van in amiens station it is always the same expression one catches rather weary rather sullen inturned the shoulders droop the very outline is a note of interrogation they look up as the privileged tourist of the front in the big automobile or the reserved compartment with his officer or so in charge passes importantly one meets a pair of eyes that seems to say perhaps you understand in which case it is a part i think of this disposition to investigate what makes everyone collect specimens of the war everywhere the souvenir forces itself upon the attention the homecoming permissionaire brings with him invariably a considerable weight of broken objects bits of shell cartridge clips helmets it is a peripatetic museum it is as if he hoped for a clue it is almost impossible i have found to escape these pieces in evidence i am the least collecting of men but i have brought home italian cartridges austrian cartridges the fuse of an austrian shell a broken italian bayonet and a note that is worth half a franc within the confines of amiens but a large heavy piece of exploded shell that had been thrust very urgently upon my attention upon the carso i contrived to lose during the temporary confusion of our party by the arrival and explosion of another prospective souvenir in our close proximity and two really very large and almost complete specimens of some species of ammonites unknown to me from the hills to the east of the adige partially wrapped in a back number of the corriere della sera that were pressed upon me by a friendly officer were unfortunately lost on the line between verona and milan through the gross negligence of a railway porter but i doubt if they would have thrown any very conclusive light upon the war i avow myself an extreme pacifist i am against the man who first takes up the weapon i carry my pacifism far beyond the ambiguous little group of british and foreign sentimentalists who pretend so amusingly to be socialists in the labour leader whose conception of foreign policy is to give germany now a peace that would be no more than a breathing time for a fresh outrage upon civilisation and who would even make heroes of the crazy young assassins of the dublin crime i do not understand those people i do not merely want to stop this war i want to nail down war in its coffin modern war is an intolerable thing it is not a thing to trifle with in this urban district council way it is a thing to end forever i have always hated it so far that is as my imagination enabled me to realise it and now that i have been seeing it sometimes quite closely for a full month i hate it more than ever i never imagined a quarter of its waste its boredom its futility its desolation it is merely a destructive and dispersive instead of a constructive and accumulative industrialism it is a gigantic dusty muddy weedy bloodstained silliness it is the plain duty of every man to give his life and all that he has if by so doing he may help to end it i hate germany which has thrust this experience upon mankind as i hate some horrible infectious disease the

discipline as participation in mightier scenes those who write concrete history without ever having taken part in practical politics are one might say in the position of those ancients who wrote about the human body without ever having effectively explored it by dissection mr carlyle it is true by force of penetrating imaginative genius has reproduced in stirring and resplendent dithyrambs the fire and passion the rage and tears the many tinted dawn and the blood red sunset of the french revolution and the more a man learns about the details of the revolution the greater is his admiration for mr carlyle s magnificent performance but it is dramatic presentation not social analysis a masterpiece of literature not a scientific investigation a prodigy of poetic insight not a sane and quantitative exploration of the complex processes the deep lying economical fiscal and political conditions that prepared so immense an explosion we have to remember it is true that m taine is not professing to write a history in the ordinary sense his book lies if we may use two very pompous but indispensable words partly in the region of historiography but much more in the region of sociology the study of the french revolution cannot yet be a history of the past for the french still walk per ignes suppositos and the revolution is still some way from being fully accomplished it was the disputes between the roman and the reformed churches which inspired historical research in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries it is the disputes among french parties that now inspire what professes to be historiography but what is really a sort of experimental investigation in the science of society they little know how long and weary a journey lies before them said burke who undertake to bring great masses of men into the political unity of a nation the process is still going on and a man of m taine s lively intellectual sensibility can no more escape its influences than he can escape the ingredients of the air he breathes we may add that if his work had been really historic he must inevitably have gone further back than the eighteenth century for the origins of contemporary france the very slight vague and unsubstantial chapter with which he opens his work cannot be accepted as a substitute for what the subject really demanded a serious summary however condensed and rapid of the various forces accidents deliberate lines of policy which from the breaking up of the great fiefs down to the death of lewis the fourteenth had prepared the distractions of the monarchy under lewis s descendants full of interest as it is m taine s book can hardly be described as containing much that is new or strikingly significant he develops one idea indeed which we have never before seen stated in its present form but which if it implies more than has been often advanced by previous writers in other forms cannot be accepted as true this is perhaps a point better worth discussing than any other which his book raises the rest is a very elaborate and thorough description of the structure of society of its physiognomy in manners and characteristics the privileges the burdens the daily walk and conversation of the various classes which made up the french people between the regency and the revolution m taine s method of description does not strike one as altogether happy it is a common complaint against french historians that they are too lax about their authorities and too heedless about giving us chapter and verse for their assertions m taine goes to the contrary extreme and pours his note books into his text with a steady handed profusion that is excessively fatiguing and makes the result far less effective than it would have been if all this industrious reading had been thoroughly fused and recast into a homogeneous whole it is an ungenerous trick of criticism to disparage good work by comparing it with better but the reader can scarcely help contrasting m taine s overcrowded pages with the perfect assimilation the pithy fulness the pregnant meditation of de tocqueville s book on the same subject when we attempt to reduce m taine s chapters to a body of propositions standing out in definite relief from one another yet conveying a certain unity of interpretation we soon feel how possible it is for an author to have literary clearness along with historic obscurity in another respect we are inclined to question the felicity of m taine s method it does not convey the impression of movement the steps and changes in the conflict among the organs of the old society are not marked in their order and succession the reader is not kept alive to the gradual progress of the break up of old institutions and ideas the sense of an active and ceaseless struggle extending in various stages across the century is effaced by an exclusive attention to the social details of a given phase we need the story you cannot effectively reproduce the true sense and significance of such an epoch as the eighteenth century in france without telling us however barely the tale for example of the long battle of the ecclesiastical factions and the yet more important series of battles between the judiciary and the crown if m taine s book were a piece of abstract social analysis the above remark would not be true but it is a study of the concrete facts of french life and society,3

if i didn t intend to finish the whole bottle of claret myself he would trouble me to spare him a glass he also added somewhat illogically that it really did not matter seeing both ethelbertha and mrs harris were women of sense who would judge him better than to believe for a moment that the suggestion emanated from him this little point settled the question was what sort of a change harris as usual was for the sea he said he knew a yacht just the very thing one that we could manage by ourselves no skulking lot of lubbers loafing about adding to the expense and taking away from the romance give him a handy boy he would sail it himself we knew that yacht and we told him so we had been on it with harris before it smells of bilge water and greens to the exclusion of all other scents no ordinary sea air can hope to head against it so far as sense of smell is concerned one might be spending a week in limehouse hole there is no place to get out of the rain the saloon is ten feet by four and half of that is taken up by a stove which falls to pieces when you go to light it you have to take your bath on deck and the towel blows overboard just as you step out of the tub harris and the boy do all the interesting work the lugging and the reefing the letting her go and the heeling her over and all that sort of thing leaving george and myself to do the peeling of the potatoes and the washing up very well then said harris let s take a proper yacht with a skipper and do the thing in style that also i objected to i know that skipper his notion of yachting is to lie in what he calls the offing where he can be well in touch with his wife and family to say nothing of his favourite public house years ago when i was young and inexperienced i hired a yacht myself three things had combined to lead me into this foolishness i had had a stroke of unexpected luck ethelbertha had expressed a yearning for sea air and the very next morning in taking up casually at the club a copy of the sportsman i had come across the following advertisement to yachtsmen unique opportunity rogue ton yawl owner called away suddenly on business is willing to let this superbly fitted greyhound of the sea for any period short or long two cabins and saloon pianette by woffenkoff new copper terms guineas a week apply pertwee and co a bucklersbury it had seemed to me like the answer to a prayer the new copper did not interest me what little washing we might want could wait i thought but the pianette by woffenkoff sounded alluring i pictured ethelbertha playing in the evening something with a chorus in which perhaps the crew with a little training might join while our moving home bounded greyhound like over the silvery billows i took a cab and drove direct to a bucklersbury mr pertwee was an unpretentious looking gentleman who had an unostentatious office on the third floor he showed me a picture in water colours of the rogue flying before the wind the deck was at an angle of to the ocean in the picture no human beings were represented on the deck i suppose they had slipped off indeed i do not see how anyone could have kept on unless nailed i pointed out this disadvantage to the agent who however explained to me that the picture represented the rogue doubling something or other on the well known occasion of her winning the medway challenge shield mr pertwee assumed that i knew all about the event so that i did not like to ask any questions two specks near the frame of the picture which at first i had taken for moths represented it appeared the second and third winners in this celebrated race a photograph of the yacht at anchor off gravesend was less impressive but suggested more stability all answers to my inquiries being satisfactory i took the thing for a fortnight mr pertwee said it was fortunate i wanted it only for a fortnight later on i came to agree with him the time fitting in exactly with another hiring had i required it for three weeks he would have been compelled to refuse me the letting being thus arranged mr pertwee asked me if i had a skipper in my eye that i had not was also fortunate things seemed to be turning out luckily for me all round because mr pertwee felt sure i could not do better than keep on mr goyles at present in charge an excellent skipper so mr pertwee assured me a man who knew the sea as a man knows his own wife

may complain of misinterpretation if the greater part of miss taylor s article with which i entirely sympathise is supposed to be applicable to my intolerance let us have full toleration by all means upon all questions in which there is room for doubt or which cannot be distinctly proved to affect the welfare of mankind but when miss taylor has shown what basis exists for criminal legislation except the clear right of mankind not to tolerate that which is demonstrably contrary to the welfare of society i will admit that such demonstration ought only to be believed in by the curates and old women to whom she refers recent events have not weakened the conviction i expressed in a much abused speech at the london school board that ultramontanism is demonstrably the enemy of society and must be met with resistance merely passive if possible but active if necessary by the whole power of the state next in order it seems proper that i should briefly refer to my friend mr mivart s onslaught upon my criticism of mr darwin s critics himself among the number which will be found in this volume in evolution and its consequences i am accused of misrepresentation misquotation misunderstanding and numerous other negative and positive literary and scientific sins and much subtle ingenuity is expended by mr mivart in attempting to extricate himself from the position in which my exposition of the real opinions of father suarez has placed him so much more in fact has mr mivart s ingenuity impressed me than any other feature of his reply that i shall take the liberty of re stating the main issue between us and for the present leaving that issue alone to the judgment of the public footnote contemporary review january in his book on the genesis of species mr mivart after discussing the opinions of sundry catholic writers of authority among whom he especially includes st augustin st thomas aquinas and the jesuit suarez proceeds to say it is then evident that ancient and most venerable theological authorities distinctly assert derivative creation and thus their teachings harmonize with all that modern science can possibly require by the derivative creation of organic forms mr mivart understands that god created them by conferring on the material world the power to evolve them under suitable conditions footnote bunsen s outlines of the philosophy of universal history vol i p on the contrary i proved by evidence which mr mivart does not venture to impugn that suarez in his tractatus de opere sex dierum expressly rejects st augustin s and st thomas views that he vehemently advocates the literal interpretation of the account of the creation given in the book of genesis and that he treats with utter scorn the notion that the almighty could have used the language of that book unless he meant it to be taken literally mr mivart therefore either has read suarez and has totally misrepresented him a hypothesis which i hope i need hardly say i do not for a moment entertain or he has got his information at second hand and has himself been deceived but in that case it is surely an imprudence on his part to reproach me with having read suarez ad hoc and evidently without the guidance of anyone familiar with that author no doubt in the matter of guidance mr mivart has the advantage of me nevertheless the guides who supplied him with his references to suarez metaphysica while they left him in ignorance of the existence of the tractatus are guides with whose services it might be better to dispense leaders who wilfully shut their eyes being even more liable to lodge one in a ditch than blind leaders at the time when the essay on methods and results of ethnology was written i had not met with a passage in professor max m ller s last results of turanian researches which shows so appositely that the profoundest study of philology leads to conclusions respecting the relation of ethnology with philology similar to those at which i had arrived in approaching the question from the anatomist s side that i cannot refrain from quoting it footnote london april nor should we in our phonological studies either expect or desire more than general hints from physical ethnology the proper and rational connection between the two sciences is that of mutual advice and suggestion but nothing more much of the confusion of terms and indistinctness of principles both in ethnology and phonology are due to the combined study of these heterogeneous sciences ethnological race and phonological race are not commensurate except in ante historical times or perhaps at the very dawn of history with the migration of tribes their wars their colonies their conquests and alliances which if we may judge from their effects must have been much more violent in the ethnic than even in the political period of history it is impossible to imagine that race and language should continue to run parallel the physiologist should pursue his own science unconcerned about language it is further desirable to remark that the statements in this essay respecting the forms of native american crania need rectification on this point i refer the reader who is interested

that s the hard part of it said patsy her cousin i think the mothers and wives and sweethearts are as much to be pitied as the fallen soldiers the men know what has happened but the women don t it isn t so bad when they re killed outright the family gets a medal to indicate that their hero has died for his country but the wounded are lost sight of and must suffer in silence with no loving hands to soothe their agony my dears pleaded uncle john plaintively why do you insist upon flavoring our breakfast with these horrors i i there take it away i can t eat the conversation halted abruptly the girls were likewise unnerved by the mental pictures evolved by their remarks and it was now too late to restore cheerfulness to the morning meal they sat in pensive silence for a while and were glad when mr merrick pushed back his chair and rose from the table as beth and patsy followed their uncle into the cosy library where he was accustomed to smoke his morning cigar the little man remarked let s see this is the seventh of september quite right uncle said patsy isn t this the day maud stanton is due to arrive no replied beth she will come to morrow morning it s a good four days trip from california to new york you know i wonder why she is coming here at this time of year said patsy reflectively and i wonder if her aunt jane or her sister flo are with her she did not mention them in her telegram answered beth all she said was to expect her wednesday morning it seems quite mysterious that telegram for i had no idea maud thought of coming east well we will know all about it when she arrives observed uncle john i will be glad to see maud again for she is one of my especial favorites she s a very dear girl exclaimed patsy with emphasis it will be simply glorious to the doorbell rang sharply there was a moment s questioning pause for it was too early for visitors the pattering feet of the little maid mary approached the door and next moment a boyish voice demanded is mr merrick at home or the young ladies or why it s ajo shouted patsy springing to her feet and making a dive for the hallway jones said mr merrick looking incredulous it must be declared beth for now patsy s voice was blended with that of the boy in a rapid interchange of question and answer then in she came dragging him joyously by the arm this is certainly a surprise said mr merrick shaking the tall slender youth by the hand with evident pleasure when did you get to town asked beth greeting the boy cordially and why didn t you let us know you were on the way from far off los angeles well said jones seating himself facing them and softly rubbing his lean hands together to indicate his satisfaction at this warm reception it s a long long story and i may as well tell it methodically or you ll never appreciate the adventurous spirit that led me again to new york the one place i heartily detest oh ajo protested patsy is this the way to retain the friendship of new yorkers isn t honesty appreciated here he wanted to know go ahead with your story said uncle john we left you some months ago at the harbor of los angeles wondering what you were going to do with that big ship of yours that lay anchored in the pacific if i remember aright you were considering whether you dared board it to return to that mysterious island home of yours at at sangoa said patsy thank you for giving me a starting point returned the boy with a smile you may remember that when i landed in your country from sangoa i was a miserable invalid the voyage had ruined my stomach and wrecked my constitution i crossed the continent to new york and consulted the best specialists and they nearly put an end to me i returned to the pacific coast to die as near home as possible and and there i met you and patsy saved your life added beth she did first however maud stanton saved me from drowning then patsy doyle doctored me and made me well and strong and now and now you look like a modern hercules asserted patsy gazing with some pride at the bronzed cheeks and clear eyes of the former invalid and ignoring his slight proportions whatever have you been doing with yourself since then taking a sea voyage he affirmed really an absolute fact for months i dared not board the arabella my sea yacht for fear of a return of my old malady but after you deserted me and came to this this artificial dreary bewildering never mind insulting my birthplace sir oh were you born here patsy then i ll give the town credit so after you deserted me at los angeles you still had mrs montrose and her nieces maud and flo stanton i know and i love them all but they became so tremendously busy that i scarcely saw them and finally i began to feel lonely those stanton girls are chock full of business energy and they hadn t the time to devote to me that you people did so i stood on the shore and looked at the arabella until i mustered up courage to go aboard surviving that i made captain carg steam slowly along the coast for a few miles nothing dreadful happened so i made a day s voyage and still ate my three squares a day that was encouraging i knew all the time it wasn t the voyage that wrecked your stomach said patsy confidently what was it then ptomaine poisoning or something like that well anyhow i found i could stand ocean travel again so i determined on a voyage the panama

preparation is as necessary as literary preparation there is no necessity that the business should be on any majestic and imperial scale to be a guardian of the poor in an east end parish to be behind the scenes of some great strike of labour to be an active member of the parliamentary committee of a trades council or of the executive committee of a union or a league may be quite as instructive discipline as participation in mightier scenes those who write concrete history without ever having taken part in practical politics are one might say in the position of those ancients who wrote about the human body without ever having effectively explored it by dissection mr carlyle it is true by force of penetrating imaginative genius has reproduced in stirring and resplendent dithyrambs the fire and passion the rage and tears the many tinted dawn and the blood red sunset of the french revolution and the more a man learns about the details of the revolution the greater is his admiration for mr carlyle s magnificent performance but it is dramatic presentation not social analysis a masterpiece of literature not a scientific investigation a prodigy of poetic insight not a sane and quantitative exploration of the complex processes the deep lying economical fiscal and political conditions that prepared so immense an explosion we have to remember it is true that m taine is not professing to write a history in the ordinary sense his book lies if we may use two very pompous but indispensable words partly in the region of historiography but much more in the region of sociology the study of the french revolution cannot yet be a history of the past for the french still walk per ignes suppositos and the revolution is still some way from being fully accomplished it was the disputes between the roman and the reformed churches which inspired historical research in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries it is the disputes among french parties that now inspire what professes to be historiography but what is really a sort of experimental investigation in the science of society they little know how long and weary a journey lies before them said burke who undertake to bring great masses of men into the political unity of a nation the process is still going on and a man of m taine s lively intellectual sensibility can no more escape its influences than he can escape the ingredients of the air he breathes we may add that if his work had been really historic he must inevitably have gone further back than the eighteenth century for the origins of contemporary france the very slight vague and unsubstantial chapter with which he opens his work cannot be accepted as a substitute for what the subject really demanded a serious summary however condensed and rapid of the various forces accidents deliberate lines of policy which from the breaking up of the great fiefs down to the death of lewis the fourteenth had prepared the distractions of the monarchy under lewis s descendants full of interest as it is m taine s book can hardly be described as containing much that is new or strikingly significant he develops one idea indeed which we have never before seen stated in its present form but which if it implies more than has been often advanced by previous writers in other forms cannot be accepted as true this is perhaps a point better worth discussing than any other which his book raises the rest is a very elaborate and thorough description of the structure of society of its physiognomy in manners and characteristics the privileges the burdens the daily walk and conversation of the various classes which made up the french people between the regency and the revolution m taine s method of description does not strike one as altogether happy it is a common complaint against french historians that they are too lax about their authorities and too heedless about giving us chapter and verse for their assertions m taine goes to the contrary extreme and pours his note books into his text with a steady handed profusion that is excessively fatiguing and makes the result far less effective than it would have been if all this industrious reading had been thoroughly fused and recast into a homogeneous whole it is an ungenerous trick of criticism to disparage good work by comparing it with better but the reader can scarcely help contrasting m taine s overcrowded pages with the perfect assimilation the pithy fulness the pregnant meditation of de tocqueville s book on the same subject when we attempt to reduce m taine s chapters to a body of propositions standing out in definite relief from one another yet conveying a certain unity of interpretation we soon feel how possible it is for an author to have literary clearness along with historic obscurity in another respect we are inclined to question the felicity of m taine s method it does not convey the impression of movement the steps and changes in the conflict among the organs of the old society are not marked in their order and succession the reader is not kept alive to the gradual progress of the break up of old institutions and ideas the sense of an active and ceaseless struggle extending in various stages across the century is effaced by an exclusive attention to the social details of a given phase we need the story you cannot effectively reproduce the true sense and significance of such an epoch as the eighteenth century in france without telling us however barely the tale for example of the long battle of the ecclesiastical factions and the yet more important series of battles between the judiciary and the crown if m taine s book were a piece of abstract social analysis the above remark would not be true but it is a study of the concrete facts of french life and society,3

of this series entitled the rover boys at school at the hall they made a score of friends and several enemies some of which will be introduced later a term at school was followed by a trip on the ocean and then one into the jungles of the dark continent in search of mr rover who had mysteriously disappeared then the rover boys went out west and to the great lakes and later spent a fine time hunting in the mountains they likewise spent some time in camp with their fellow cadets and during the summer vacation took a long trip on land and sea then they returned home and during another vacation sailed down the ohio river in a houseboat spent some time on the plains took an unexpected trip to southern waters and then came back to the farm on getting back home as related in the twelfth volume of this series called the rover boys on the farm the boys had imagined that adventures for them were a thing of the past they were willing to take it easy but this was not to be some bad men including a sharper named sid merrick were responsible for the theft of some freight from the local railroad and merrick by a slick trick obtained possession of some traction company bonds belonging to randolph rover the rover boys managed to locate the freight thieves but sid merrick got away from them dropping a pocketbook containing the traction company bonds in his flight this was at a time when dick tom and sam had returned to putnam hall for their final term at that institution at the hall they had made a bitter enemy of a big stocky bully named tad sobber and of another lad named nick pell tad sobber to get even with the rovers for a fancied injury sent to the latter a box containing a live poisonous snake the snake got away and hid in nick pell s desk and nick was bitten and for some time it was feared that he might die he exposed tad sobber and fearing arrest the bully ran away from the hall later much to their surprise the rover boys learned that the bully was a ward and nephew of sid merrick and when the sharper disappeared tad sobber went with him they are certainly a bad pair said dick but how bad the rovers were still to find out with the boys on the train were john powell better known as songbird because he had a habit of reciting newly made doggerell which he called poetry hans mueller a german youth who frequently got his english badly twisted fred garrison who had graduated with the rovers and some others dick you haven t told me yet what you intended to do this summer remarked fred garrison as the train rolled on because i don t know fred answered the elder rover my father has something in store but i don t know what it is can t you guess no i wish we could take another trip like that on the houseboat it was certainly a dandy the best ever put in tom even if we did have trouble with lew flapp dan baxter and some others speaking of dan baxter puts me in mind of something came from songbird powell it has just leaked out that tad sobber sent a note to captain putnam in which tad blamed some of the cadets for his troubles and said he was going to get square some day did he mention any names questioned sam yes mine yes and dick s and tom s too it is just like sobber to blame his troubles on somebody else remarked dick i am not afraid of him declared tom he had better keep his distance unless he wants to get the worst of it we used to put up with a whole lot from dan baxter before he reformed i am not going to put up with as much from sobber tad certainly went off in bad company said sam his uncle ought to be in prison this minute have the authorities heard anything of merrick asked songbird not a thing i dink me dot feller has skipped to europe alretty vouchsafed hans mueller he vould peen afraid to stay py der united states in yah and the german boy shook his head wisely personally i never want to set eyes on sobber again said dick with a shrug of his broad shoulders the idea of introducing that deadly snake into the school was the limit why half a dozen of us might have been bitten instead of only poor pell maybe he did it only for a joke said larry colby another of the cadets if he did it was carrying a joke altogether too far endangering one or more human lives i don t believe in that sort of fun nor do i came from several if he is in europe with his uncle perhaps i ll meet him there said larry colby i am going to france and italy with my uncle and cousin wish some of you fellows were going along he added wistfully i am going to the maine woods said a lad named george granberry you can never guess who is going there too who william philander tubbs and mr strong what our own dude going to camp in the wilderness cried tom oh if i was only along wouldn t i give him some surprises i ll have some fun don t forget that replied george with a grin but as mr strong is going to be along of course i ll have to be a little careful dear mr strong murmured sam with a sigh what a fine teacher he is and how i hate to give him up i envy your having him along said dick at that moment the train rolled into a station and larry and some of the others got off we leave you at the next station said

peculiar to the age of innocence were all there in her enthusiasm she nearly gave her a sprained ankle which had belonged to her sister still shaking her head over her mistake she drew flora s latest

arrangement made the night before and being reminded by her daughter questioned whether any good could come of attempts to peer into the future mr dowson was still more emphatic but his objections being recognized by both ladies as trouser pocket ones carried no weight it ended in flora going off with half a crown in her glove and an urgent request from her father to make it as difficult as possible for the sibyl by giving a false name and address no name was asked for however as miss dowson was shown into the untidy little back room on the first floor in which the sorceress ate slept

conditions in which the different regions of the earth are placed in respect to their capacity of production for animal and vegetable food we shall see that this adjustment of the constitution of man both to the differences of climate and to the changes of the seasons is a very wise and beneficent arrangement of divine providence to confine man absolutely either to animal or vegetable food would be to depopulate a large part of the earth it results from these general facts in respect to the distribution of the supplies of animal and vegetable food for man in different latitudes that in all northern climes in our hemisphere men living in a savage state must be hunters while those that live near the equator must depend for their subsistence on fruits and roots growing wild when moreover any tribe or race of men in either of these localities take the first steps toward civilization they begin in the one case by taming animals and rearing them in flocks and herds and in the other case by saving the seeds of food producing plants and cultivating them by artificial tillage in inclosed and private fields this last is the condition of all the half civilized tribes of the tropical regions of the earth whereas the former prevails in all the northern temperate and arctic regions as far to the northward as domesticated animals can live from time immemorial the whole interior of the continent of asia has been inhabited by tribes and nations that have taken this one step in the advance toward civilization but have gone no farther they live not like the indians in north america by hunting wild beasts but by rearing and pasturing flocks and herds of animals that they have tamed these animals feed of course on grass and herbage and as grass and herbage can only grow on open ground the forests have gradually disappeared and the country has for ages consisted of great grassy plains or of smooth hill sides covered with verdure over these plains or along the river valleys wander the different tribes of which these pastoral nations are composed living in tents or in frail huts almost equally movable and driving their flocks and herds before them from one pasture ground to another according as the condition of the grass or that of the springs and streams of water may require we obtain a pretty distinct idea of the nature of this pastoral life and of the manners and customs and the domestic constitution to which it gives rise in the accounts given us in the old testament of abraham and lot and of their wanderings with their flocks and herds over the country lying between the euphrates and the mediterranean sea they lived in tents in order that they might remove their habitations the more easily from place to place in following their flocks and herds to different pasture grounds their wealth consisted almost wholly in these flocks and herds the land being almost every where common sometimes when two parties traveling together came to a fertile and well watered district their herdsmen and followers were disposed to contend for the privilege of feeding their flocks upon it and the contention would often lead to a quarrel and combat if it had not been settled by an amicable agreement on the part of the chieftains illustration encampment of a patriarch the father of a family was the legislator and ruler of it and his sons with their wives and his son s sons remained with him sometimes for many years sharing his means of subsistence submitting to his authority and going with him from place to place with all his flocks and herds they employed too so many herdsmen and other servants and followers as to form in many cases quite an extended community and sometimes in case of hostilities with any other wandering tribe a single patriarch could send forth from his own domestic circle a force of several hundred armed men such a company as this when moving across the country on its way from one region of pasturage to another appeared like an immense caravan on its march and when settled at an encampment the tents formed quite a little town whenever the head of one of these wandering families died the tendency was not for the members of the community to separate but to keep together and allow the oldest son to take the father s place as chieftain and ruler this was necessary for defense as of course such communities as these were in perpetual danger of coming into collision with othe,3

find so much left to speak of and so many things to say in every part of england that my journey cannot be barren of intelligence which way soever i turn no though i were to oblige myself to say nothing of anything that had been spoken of before i intended once to have gone due west this journey but then i should have been obliged to crowd my observations so close to bring hampton court windsor blenheim oxford the bath and bristol all into one letter all those remarkable places lying in a line as it were in one point of the compass as to have made my letter too long or my observations too light and superficial as others have done before me this letter will divide the weighty task and consequently make it sit lighter on the memory be pleasanter to the reader and make my progress the more regular i shall therefore take in hampton court and windsor in this journey the first at my setting out and the last at my return and the rest as their situation demands as i came down from kingston in my last circuit by the south bank of the thames on the surrey side of the river so i go up to hampton court now on the north bank and on the middlesex side which i mention because as the sides of the country bordering on the river lie parallel so the beauty of the country the pleasant situations the glory of innumerable fine buildings noblemen s and gentlemen s houses and citizens retreats are so equal a match to what i had described on the other side that one knows not which to give the preference to but as i must speak of them again when i come to write of the county of middlesex which i have now purposely omitted so i pass them over here except the palace of hampton only which i mentioned in middlesex for the reasons above hampton court lies on the north bank of the river thames about two small miles from kingston and on the road from staines to kingston bridge so that the road straightening the parks a little they were obliged to part the parks and leave the paddock and the great park part on the other side the road a testimony of that just regard that the kings of england always had and still have to the common good and to the service of the country that they would not interrupt the course of the road or cause the poor people to go out of the way of their business to or from the markets and fairs for any pleasure of their own whatsoever the palace of hampton court was first founded and built from the ground by that great statesman and favourite of king henry viii cardinal wolsey and if it be a just observation anywhere as is made from the situation of the old abbeys and monasteries the clergy were excellent judges of the beauty and pleasantness of the country and chose always to plant in the best i say if it was a just observation in any case it was in this for if there be a situation on the whole river between staines bridge and windsor bridge pleasanter than another it is this of hampton close to the river yet not offended by the rising of its waters in floods or storms near to the reflux of the tides but not quite so near as to be affected with any foulness of the water which the flowing of the tides generally is the occasion of the gardens extend almost to the bank of the river yet are never overflowed nor are there any marshes on either side the river to make the waters stagnate or the air unwholesome on that account the river is high enough to be navigable and low enough to be a little pleasantly rapid so that the stream looks always cheerful not slow and sleeping like a pond this keeps the waters always clear and clean the bottom in view the fish playing and in sight and in a word it has everything that can make an inland or as i may call it a country river pleasant and agreeable i shall sing you no songs here of the river in the first person of a water nymph a goddess and i know not what according to the humour of the ancient poets i shall talk nothing of the marriage of old isis the male river with the beautiful thame the female river a whimsey as simple as the subject was empty but i shall speak of the river as occasion presents as it really is made glorious by the splendour of its shores gilded with noble palaces strong fortifications large hospitals and public buildings with the greatest bridge and the greatest city in the world made famous by the opulence of its merchants the increase and extensiveness of its commerce by its invincible navies and by the innumerable fleets of ships sailing upon it to and from all parts of the world as i meet with the river upwards in my travels through the inland country i shall speak of it as it is the channel for conveying an infinite quantity of provisions from remote counties to london and enriching all the counties,3

when we are alone and have time i should so much like to talk with you on really serious matters there is one serious matter he assured her which i should like to discuss with you now or at any time she made a little grimace at him let it be now then she suggested leaning across the table we will leave my sort of serious things for another time i am quite certain that i know where your sort is going to lead us you are going to make love to me do you mind he asked earnestly she became suddenly grave not yet she begged let us talk and live nonsense for a few more weeks you see i really have not known you very long have i and this is a very dangerous city for flirtations at court one has to be so careful and you know i am already considered far too much of a bohemian here i was even given

your profession she reminded him pointedly i believe he exclaimed that you think more of my profession than you do of me quite impossible she retorted mockingly and yet as i dare say you have already realised it is not only the things you say to our statesmen here and the reports you make which count it is your daily life among the people of the nation to which you are attached the friends you make among them the hospitality you accept and offer which has all the time its subtle significance now i am not sure even that i am a very good companion for you mr francis norgate you are a very bad

little across the table it has been an apprenticeship only a probationary period during which one struggles towards the real thing you think you will know when you have found it she murmured he drew a little breath his voice even trembled as he answered her i know now he said softly their heads were almost touching suddenly she drew apart he glanced at her in some surprise conscious of an extraordinary change in her face of the half uttered exclamation strangled upon her lips he turned his head and followed the direction of her eyes three young men in the uniform of officers had entered the room and stood there as though looking about for a table before them the little company of head waiters had almost prostrated themselves the manager summoned in breathless haste had made a reverential approach who are these young men norgate enquired his companion made no reply her fine silky eyebrows were drawn a little closer together at that moment the tallest of the three newcomers seemed to recognise her he strode at once towards their table norgate glancing up at his approach was simply conscious of the coming of a fair young man of ordinary german type who seemed to be in a remarkably bad temper so i find you here anna the baroness rose as though unwillingly to her feet she dropped the slightest of curtseys and resumed her place your visit is a little unexpected is it not karl she remarked apparently the young man answered with an unpleasant laugh he turned and stared at norgate who returned his regard with half amused half impatient indifference the baroness leaned forward eagerly will you permit me to present mr francis norgate to you karl norgate who had suddenly recognised the newcomer rose to his feet bowed and remained standing the prince s only reply to the introduction was a frown kindly give me your seat he said imperatively i will conclude your entertainment of the baroness for a moment there was a dead silence in the background several

remarked drily the colour in the young man s face became almost purple did you hear what i said sir he demanded do you know who i am perfectly norgate replied a prince who apparently has not learnt how to behave himself in a public place the young man took a quick step forward norgate s fists were clenched and his eyes glittering the baroness stepped between them mr norgate she said you will please give me your escort home the prince s companions had seized him one by either arm an older man who had been dining in a distant corner of the room and who wore the uniform of an officer of high rank suddenly approached he addressed the prince and they all talked together in excited whispers norgate with calm fingers arranged the cloak around his companion and placed a hundred mark note upon his plate i will return for my change another evening he said to the dumbfounded waiter if you are ready baroness they left the restaurant amid an intense hush norgate waited deliberately whilst the door was somewhat unwillingly held open for him by a ma tre d h tel but outside the baroness s automobile was summoned at once she placed her fingers upon norgate s arm and he felt that she was

hailed as contributions to our latest cult in all these fields pyle s work may be equaled surpassed save in one it is improbable that anyone else will ever bring his combination of interest and talent to the depiction of these old time pirates any more than there could be a second remington to paint the now extinct indians and gun fighters of the great west important and interesting to the student of history the adventure lover and the artist as they are these pirate stories and pictures have been scattered through many magazines and books here in this volume they are gathered together for the first time perhaps not just as mr pyle would have done but with a completeness and appreciation of the real value of the material which the author s modesty might not have permitted merle johnson illustration illustration preface why is it that a little spice of deviltry lends not an unpleasantly titillating twang to the great mass of respectable flour that goes to make up the pudding of our modern civilization and pertinent to this question another why is it that the pirate has and always has had a certain lurid glamour of the heroical enveloping him round about is there deep under the accumulated debris of culture a hidden groundwork of the old time savage is there even in these well regulated times an unsubdued nature in the respectable mental household of every one of us that still kicks against the pricks of law and order to make my meaning more clear would not every boy for instance that is every boy of any account rather be a pirate captain than a member of parliament and we ourselves would we not rather read such a story as that of captain avery s capture of the east indian treasure ship with its beautiful princess and load of jewels which gems he sold by the handful history sayeth to a bristol merchant than say one of bishop atterbury s sermons or the goodly master robert boyle s religious romance of theodora and didymus it is to be apprehended that to the unregenerate nature of most of us there can be but one answer to such a query in the pleasurable warmth the heart feels in answer to tales of derring do nelson s battles are all mightily interesting but even in spite of their romance of splendid courage i fancy that the majority of us would rather turn back over the leaves of history to read how drake captured the spanish treasure ship in the south sea and of how he divided such a quantity of booty in the island of plate so named because of the tremendous dividend there declared that it had to be measured in quart bowls being too considerable to be counted courage and daring no matter how mad and ungodly have always a redundancy of vim and life to recommend them to the nether man that lies within us and no doubt his desperate courage his battle against the tremendous odds of all the civilized world of law and order have had much to do in making a popular hero of our friend of the black flag but it is not altogether courage and daring that endear him to our hearts there is another and perhaps a greater kinship in that lust for wealth that makes one s fancy revel more pleasantly in the story of the division of treasure in the pirate s island retreat the hiding of his godless gains somewhere in the sandy stretch of tropic beach there to remain hidden until the time should come to rake the doubloons up again and to spend them like a lord in polite society than in the most thrilling tales of his wonderful escapes from commissioned cruisers through tortuous channels between the coral reefs and what a life of adventure is his to be sure a life of constant alertness constant danger constant escape an ocean ishmaelite he wanders forever aimlessly homelessly now unheard of for months now careening his boat on some lonely uninhabited shore now appearing suddenly to swoop down on some merchant vessel with rattle of musketry shouting yells and a hell of unbridled passions let loose to rend and tear what a carlislean hero what a setting of blood and lust and flame and rapine for such a hero piracy such as was practiced in the flower of its days that is during the early eighteenth century was no sudden growth it was an evolution from the semilawful buccaneering of the sixteenth century just as buccaneering was upon its part in a certain sense an evolution from the unorganized unauthorized warfare of the tudor period for there was a deal of piratical smack in the anti spanish ventures of elizabethan days many of the adventurers of the sir francis drake school for instance actually overstepped again and again the bounds of international law entering into the realms of de facto piracy nevertheless while their doings were not recognized officially by the government the perpetrators were neither punished nor reprimanded for their excursions against spanish commerce at home or in the west indies rather were they commended and it was considered not altogether a discreditable thing for men to get rich upon the spoils taken from spanish galleons in times of nominal peace many of the most reputable citizens and merchants of london when they felt that the queen failed in her duty of pushing the fight against the great catholic power fitted out fleets upon their own account and sent them to levy good protestant war of a private nature upon the pope s anointed some of the treasures captured in such ventures were immense stupendous unbelievable for an example one can hardly credit the truth of the purchase gained by drake in the famous capture of the plate ship in the south sea one of the old buccaneer writers of a century later says the spaniards affirm to this day that he took at that time twelvescore tons of plate and sixteen bowls of coined money a

the money market by the lifting even of a finger are you a millionaire she asked timidly but of course you must be or you could not live in a house like this he laid his hand gently upon hers yes he said i am a millionaire a good many times over or i should not be of much account in new york but there i have told you enough about myself i sent for you as you know because there are times when i feel a little lonely and i thought that if my sister could spare one of her children it would be a kindly act and one which i might perhaps be able to repay do you think that you would like to live here with me virginia and be mistress of this house she shrank a little away the prospect was not without its terrifying side why i should love it she declared but i simply shouldn t dare to think of it you don t understand i am afraid the way we live down at wellham springs we have really no servants and we do everything ourselves i couldn t attempt to manage a house like this he smiled at her kindly perhaps he said you would find it less difficult than you think there is a housekeeper already who sees to all the practical part of it she only needs to have some one to whom she can refer now and then you would have nothing whatever to do with the managing of the servants the commissariat or anything of that sort yours would be purely social duties i am afraid she answered that i should know even less about them well he said i have some good friends who will give you hints you will find it very much easier than you imagine you have only to be natural acquire the art of listening and wear pretty gowns and you will find it a simple matter to become quite a popular person she nerved herself to ask him a question he looked so kind and good natured that it did not seem possible that he would resent it uncle she said of course i am very glad to be here and it all sounds very delightful but what about stella he leaned back in his chair there was a pained look in his face she was almost sorry that she had mentioned his daughter s name perhaps he said it is as well that you should have asked me that question i have always been an indulgent father as i think you will find me an indulgent uncle but there are certain things certain offences i might say for which i have no forgiveness stella deceived me she made use of information secret information which she acquired in this room to benefit some man in whom she was interested she used my secrets to enrich this person she did this after i had warned her i never warn twice you mean that you sent her away she asked timidly i mean that my doors are closed to her he answered gravely as they would be closed upon you if you behaved as stella has behaved but my dear child he added smiling kindly at her i do not expect this from you i feel sure that what i have said will be sufficient if you will stay with me a little time and take my daughter s place i think you will not find me very stern or very ungrateful now i am going to ring for mrs perrin my housekeeper and she will show you your room to night you and i are going to dine quite alone and we can talk again then by the by do you really mean that you have never been to new york before never she answered i have been to boston twice never anywhere else he smiled well he said the sooner you are introduced to some of its wonders the better we will dine out to night and i will take you to one of the famous restaurants it will suit me better to be somewhere out of the way for an hour or two this evening there is a panic in chicago and illinois but there you wouldn t understand that be ready at o clock but uncle she began he waved his hand i know what you are going to say clothes you will find some evening dresses in your room i have had a collection of things sent round on approval and you will probably be able to find one you can wear ah here is mrs perrin the door had opened and a middle aged lady in a stiff black silk gown had entered the room

made with the ministry and on exactly what conditions he was released from newgate have not been ascertained it is certain he never ceased to write even while in prison both anonymously and under his own name for some years in addition to pamphlet after pamphlet he published a newspaper which he called the review in which he generally sided with the moderate whigs advocated earnestly the union with scotland and gave the english people a vast deal of good advice upon foreign policy and domestic trade there is no doubt that during this time he was in the secret service of the government when the tories displaced the whigs in he managed to keep his post and took his review over to the support of the new masters justifying his turncoating by a disingenuous plea of preferring country to party his pamphleteering pen was now as active in the service of the tory prime minister harley as it had been in that of the whig godolphin the party of the latter rightly regarded him as a traitor to their cause and secured an order from the court of queen s bench directing the attorney general to prosecute defoe for certain pamphlets which they declared were directed against the hanoverian succession before the trial took place harley at whose instigation the pamphlets had been written secured his henchman a royal pardon when the tories fell from power at the death of queen anne and the whigs again obtained possession of the government only one of two courses was open to defoe he must either retire permanently from politics or again change sides he unhesitatingly chose the latter but his political reputation had now sunk so low that no party could afford the disgrace of his open support he was accordingly employed as a literary and political spy ostensibly opposing the government worming himself into the confidence of tory editors and politicians using his influence as an editorial writer to suppress items obnoxious to the government and suggesting the timely prosecution of such critics as he could not control he was able to play this double part for eight years until his treachery was discovered by one mist whose journal defoe had in his own words disabled and enervated so as to do no mischief or give any offense to the government mist hastened to disclose defoe s real character to his fellow newspaper proprietors and in we find the good daniel sorrowfully complaining i had not published my project in this pamphlet could i have got it inserted in any of the journals without feeing the journalists or publishers i have not only had the mortification to find what i sent rejected but to lose my originals not having taken copies of what i wrote heavy footed justice had at last overtaken the arch liar of his age of the two hundred and fifty odd books and pamphlets written by defoe it may fairly be said that only two robinson crusoe and the history of the plague in london are read by any but the special students of eighteenth century literature the latter will be discussed in another part of this introduction of the former it may be asserted that it arose naturally out of the circumstances of defoe s trade as a journalist so long as the papers would take his articles nobody of distinction could die without defoe s rushing out with a biography of him in these biographies when facts were scanty defoe supplied them from his imagination attributing to his hero such sentiments as he thought the average londoner could understand and describing his appearance with that minute fidelity of which only an eyewitness is supposed to be capable long practice in this kind of composition made defoe an adept in the art of lying like truth when therefore the actual and extraordinary adventures of alexander selkirk came under his notice nothing was more natural and more profitable for defoe than to seize upon this material and work it up just as he worked up the lives of jack sheppard the highwayman and of avery the king of the pirates it is interesting to notice also that the date of publication of robinson crusoe corresponds with a time at which defoe was playing the desperate and dangerous game of a political spy a single false move might bring him a stab in the dark or might land him in the hulks for transportation to some tropical island where he might have abundant need for the exercise of those mental resources that interest us so much in crusoe the secret of defoe s life at this time was known only to himself and to the minister that paid him he was almost as much alone in london as was crusoe on his desert island the success which defoe scored in robinson crusoe he never repeated his entire lack of artistic conscience is shown by his adding a dull second part to robinson crusoe and a duller series of serious reflections such as might have passed through crusoe s mind during his island captivity of even the best of defoe s other novels moll flanders roxana captain singleton the writer must confess that his judgment coincides with that of mr leslie stephen who finds two thirds of them deadly dull and the treatment such as cannot raise the story above a very moderate level the closing scenes of defoe s life were not cheerful he appears to have lost most of the fortune he acquired from his numerous writings and scarcely less numerous speculations for the two years immediately preceding his death he lived in concealment away from his home though why he fled and from what danger is not definitely known he died in a lodging in ropemaker s alley moorfields on april the only description we

the captain nodded to the sergeant the sergeant stepped aside ii peyton farquhar was a well to do planter of an old and highly respected alabama family being a slave owner and like other slave owners a politician he was naturally an original secessionist and ardently devoted to the southern cause circumstances of an imperious nature which it is unnecessary to relate here had prevented him from taking service with that gallant army which had fought the disastrous campaigns ending with the fall of corinth and he chafed under the inglorious restraint longing for the release of his energies the larger life of the soldier the opportunity for distinction that opportunity he felt would come as it comes to all in wartime meanwhile he did what he could no service was too humble for him to perform in the aid of the south no adventure to perilous for him to undertake if consistent with the character of a civilian who was at heart a soldier and who in good faith and without too much qualification assented to at least a part of the frankly villainous dictum that all is fair in love and war one evening while farquhar and his wife were sitting on a rustic bench near the entrance to his grounds a gray clad soldier rode up to the gate and asked for a drink of water mrs farquhar was only too happy to serve him with her own white hands while she was fetching the water her husband approached the dusty horseman and inquired eagerly for news from the front the yanks are repairing the railroads said the man and are getting ready for another advance they have reached the owl creek bridge put it in order and built a stockade on the north bank the commandant has issued an order which is posted everywhere declaring that any civilian caught interfering with the railroad its bridges tunnels or trains will be summarily hanged i saw the order how far is it to the owl creek bridge farquhar asked about thirty miles is there no force on this side of the creek only a picket post half a mile out on the railroad and a single sentinel at this end of the bridge suppose a man a civilian and student of hanging should elude the picket post and perhaps get the better of the sentinel said farquhar smiling what could he accomplish the soldier reflected i was there a month ago he replied i observed that the flood of last winter had lodged a great quantity of driftwood against the wooden pier at this end of the bridge it is now dry and would burn like tinder the lady had now brought the water which the soldier drank he thanked her ceremoniously bowed to her husband and rode away an hour later after nightfall he repassed the plantation going northward in the direction from which he had come he was a federal scout iii as peyton farquhar fell straight downward through the bridge he lost consciousness and was as one already dead from this state he was awakened ages later it seemed to him by the pain of a sharp pressure upon his throat followed by a sense of suffocation keen poignant agonies seemed to shoot from his neck downward through every fiber of his body and limbs these pains appeared to flash along well defined lines of ramification and to beat with an inconceivably rapid periodicity they seemed like streams of pulsating fire heating him to an intolerable temperature as to his head he was conscious of nothing but a feeling of fullness of congestion these sensations were unaccompanied by thought the intellectual part of his nature was already effaced he had power only to feel and feeling was torment he was conscious of motion encompassed in a luminous cloud of which he was now merely the fiery heart without material substance he swung through unthinkable arcs of oscillation like a vast pendulum then all at once with terrible suddenness the light about him shot upward with the noise of a loud splash a frightful roaring was in his ears and all was cold and dark the power of thought was restored he knew that the rope had broken and he had fallen into the stream there was no additional strangulation the noose about his neck was already suffocating him and kept the water from his lungs to die of hanging at the bottom of a river the idea seemed to him ludicrous he opened his eyes in the darkness and saw above him a gleam of light but how distant how inaccessible he was still sinking for the light became fainter and fainter until it was a mere glimmer then it began to grow and brighten and he knew that he was rising toward the surface knew it with reluctance for he was now very comfortable to be hanged and drowned he thought that is not so bad but i do not wish to be shot no i will not be shot that is not fair he was not conscious of an effort but a sharp pain in his wrist apprised him that he was trying to free his hands he gave the struggle his attention as an idler might observe the feat of a juggler without interest in the outcome what splendid effort what magnificent what superhuman strength ah that was a fine endeavor bravo the cord fell away his arms parted and floated upward the hands dimly seen on each side in the growing light he watched them with a new interest as first one and then the other pounced upon the noose at his neck they tore it away and thrust it fiercely aside its undulations resembling those of a water snake put it back put it back he thought he shouted these words to his hands for the undoing of the noose had been succeeded by the direst pang that he had yet experienced his neck ached horribly his brain was on fire his heart which had been fluttering faintly gave a great leap trying to force

had clusters of five leaves and which of three the horse on which mr croft had ridden over from the springs was tied to a fence near by and he now seemed to indicate by his restless movements that it was quite time for the gentleman to go home but with this opinion mr croft decidedly differed he had had a long walk with the lady and plenty of opportunities to say anything that he might choose but still there was something very important which had not been said and which mr croft very much wished to say before he left miss roberta that afternoon his only reason for hesitation was the fact that he did not know what he wished to say he was a man who always kept a lookout on the bows of his daily action in storm or in calm in fog or in bright sunshine that lookout must be at his post and upon his reports it depended whether mr croft set more sail put on more steam reversed his engine or anchored his vessel a report from this lookout was what he hoped to elicit by the remark which he wished to make he desired greatly to know whether miss roberta march looked upon him in the light of a lover or in that of an intimate acquaintance whose present intimacy depended a good deal upon the propinquity of midbranch and the green sulphur springs he had endeavored to produce upon her mind the latter impression if he ever wished her to regard him as a lover he could do this in the easiest and most straightforward way but the other procedure was much more difficult and he was not certain that he had succeeded in it how to find out in what light she viewed him without allowing the lady to perceive his purpose was a very delicate operation i wish said miss roberta poking with the end of her parasol at some half withered wild flowers which lay on the steps beneath her that you would change your mind and take supper with us mr croft s mind was very busy in endeavoring to think of some casual remark some observation regarding man nature or society or even an anecdote or historical incident which if brought into the conversation might produce upon the lady s countenance some shade of expression or some variation in her tone or words which would give him the information he sought for but what he said was are they really suppers that you have or are they only teas now i know said the lady why you have sometimes taken dinner with us but never supper you were afraid that it would be a tea lawrence croft was thinking that if this girl believed that he was in love with her it would make a great deal of difference in his present course of action if such were the case he ought not to come here so often or in fact he ought not to come at all until he had decided for himself what he was going to do but what could he say that would cause her for the briefest moment to unveil her idea of himself i never could endure he said those meals which consist of thin shavings of bread with thick plasters of butter aided and abetted by sweet cakes preserves and tea you should have reserved those remarks she said until you had found out what sort of evening meal we have he could certainly say something he thought perhaps it might be some little fanciful story which would call up in her mind without his appearing to intend it some thought of his relationship to her as a lover that is if she had ever had such a notion if this could be done her face would betray the fact but not being ready to make such a remark he said i beg your pardon but do you really have suppers in the english fashion oh no answered miss roberta we don t have a great cold joint with old cheese and pitchers of brown stout and ale but neither do we content ourselves with thin bread and butter and preserves we have coffee as well as tea hot rolls fleecy and light hot batter bread made of our finest corn meal hot biscuits and stewed fruit with plenty of sweet milk and buttermilk and if anybody wants it he can always have a slice of cold ham if i could only feel sure thought mr croft that she looked upon me merely as an acquaintance i would cease to trouble my mind on this subject and let everything go on as before but i am not sure and i would rather not come here again until i am and at what hour he asked do you partake of a meal like that in summer time said miss roberta we have supper when it is dark enough to light the lamps my uncle dislikes very much to be deprived by the advent of a meal of the out door enjoyment of a late afternoon or as we call it down here the evening it would be easy enough thought mr croft for me to say something about my being suddenly obliged to go away and then notice its effect upon her but apart from the fact that i would not do anything so vulgar and commonplace it would not advantage me in the slightest degree she would see through the flimsiness of my purpose and no matter how she looked upon me would show nothing but a well bred regret that i should be obliged to go away at such a pleasant season i think the hour for your supper said he is a very suitable one but i am not sure that such a variety of hot bread would agree with me did you ever see more healthy looking ladies and gentlemen than you find in virginia asked miss march it is not that i want to know if she looks favorably upon me said lawrence croft to himself for when i wish to discover that i shall simply ask her what i wish now to know is whether or not she considers me at all as a lover there surely must be something i can say which will give me a clew the virginians as a rule he replied are certainly a very well grown and vigorous race in spite of

ancestors and relations he wrote letters with a fine painful penmanship on a ruled block he bought at hartshorne s drug store to distant bumpuses in kansas and illinois and michigan common descendants of ebenezer the original immigrant of dolton many of these western kinsmen answered not so the magisterial bumpus who lived in boston on the water side of beacon whom likewise he had ventured to address to the indignation and disgust of his elder daughter janet why are you so proud of ebenezer she demanded once scornfully why aren t we descended from him how many generations seven said edward promptly emphasizing the last syllable janet was quick at figures she made a mental calculation well you ve got one hundred and twenty seven other ancestors of ebenezer s time haven t you edward was a little surprised he had never thought of this but his ardour for ebenezer remained undampened genealogy his own had become his religion and instead of going to church he spent his sunday mornings poring over papers of various degrees of discolouration making careful notes on the ruled block this consciousness of his descent from good american stock that had somehow been deprived of its heritage while a grievance to him was also a comfort it had a compensating side in spite of the lack of sympathy of his daughters and his wife hannah bumpus took the situation more grimly she was a logical projection in a new environment of the religious fatalism of ancestors whose god was a god of vengeance she did not concern herself as to what all this vengeance was about life was a trap into which all mortals walked sooner or later and her particular trap had a treadmill a round of household duties she kept whirling with an energy that might have made their fortunes if she had been the head of the family it is bad to be a fatalist unless one has an incontrovertible belief in one s destiny which hannah had not but she kept the little flat with its worn furniture which had known so many journeys as clean as a merchant ship of old salem and when it was scoured and dusted to her satisfaction she would sally forth to bonnaccossi s grocery and provision store on the corner to do her bargaining in competition with the italian housewives of the neighborhood she was wont indeed to pause outside for a moment her quick eye encompassing the coloured prints of red and yellow jellies cast in rounded moulds decked with slices of orange the gaudy boxes of cereals and buckwheat flour the brookfield eggs in packages significant this modern package system of an era of flats with little storage space she took in at a glance the blue lettered placard announcing the current price of butterine and walked around to the other side of the store on holmes street where the beef and bacon hung where the sidewalk stands were filled in the autumn with cranberries apples cabbages and spinach with little outer complaint she had adapted herself to the constantly lowering levels to which her husband had dropped and if she hoped that in fillmore street they had reached bottom she did not say so her unbetrayed regret was for the loss of what she would have called respectability and the giving up long ago in the little city which had been their home of the servant girl had been the first wrench until they came to hampton they had always lived in houses and her adaptation to a flat had been hard a flat without a parlour hannah bumpus regarded a parlour as necessary to a respectable family as a wedding ring to a virtuous woman janet and lise would be growing up there would be young men and no place to see them save the sidewalks the fear that haunted her came true and she never was reconciled the two girls went to the public schools and afterwards inevitably to work and it seemed to be a part of her punishment for the sins of her forefathers that she had no more control over them than if they had been boarders while she looked on helplessly they did what they pleased janet whom she never understood was almost as much a source of apprehension as lise who became part and parcel of all hannah deemed reprehensible in this new america which she refused to recognize and acknowledge as her own country to send them through the public schools had been a struggle hannah used to lie awake nights wondering what would happen if edward became sick it worried her that they never saved any money try as she would to cut the expenses down there was a limit of decency new england thrift hitherto justly celebrated was put to shame by that which the foreigners displayed and which would have delighted the souls of gentlemen of the manchester school every once in a while there rose up before her fabulous instances of this thrift of italians and jews who ignorant emigrants

not learned portraiture while painting into the corner of compositions full of saints and madonnas their kneeling patrons at seventeen years old i was already an old fashioned brass cannon full of shot and nothing had kept me from going off but a doubt as to my capacity to shoot straight iii i was not an industrious student and knew only what i had found by accident and i found nothing i cared for after titian and titian i knew from an imitation of his supper of emmaus in dublin till blake and the pre raphaelites and among my father s friends were no pre raphaelites some indeed had come to bedford park in the enthusiasm of the first building and others to be near those that had there was todhunter a well off man who had bought my father s pictures while my father was still pre raphaelite once a dublin doctor he was now a poet and a writer of poetical plays a tall sallow lank melancholy man a good scholar and a good intellect and with him my father carried on a warm exasperated friendship fed i think by old memories and wasted by quarrels over matters of opinion of all the survivors he was the most dejected and the least estranged and i remember encouraging him with a sense of worship shared to buy a very expensive carpet designed by morris he displayed it without strong liking and would have agreed had there been any to find fault if he had liked anything strongly he might have been a famous man for a few years later he was to write under some casual patriotic impulse certain excellent verses now in all irish anthologies but with him every book was a new planting and not a new bud on an old bough he had i think no peace in himself but my father s chief friend was york powell a famous oxford professor of history a broad built broad headed brown bearded man clothed in heavy blue cloth and looking but for his glasses and the dim sight of a student like some captain in the merchant service one often passed with pleasure from todhunter s company to that of one who was almost ostentatiously at peace he cared nothing for philosophy nothing for economics nothing for the policy of nations for history as he saw it was a memory of men who were amusing or exciting to think about he impressed all who met him and seemed to some a man of genius but he had not enough ambition to shape his thought or conviction to give rhythm to his style and remained always a poor writer i was too full of unfinished speculations and premature convictions to value rightly his conversation informed by a vast erudition which would give itself to every casual association of speech and company precisely because he had neither cause nor design my father however found powell s concrete narrative manner in talk a necessary completion of his own and when i asked him in a letter many years later where he got his philosophy replied from york powell and thereon added no doubt remembering that powell was without ideas by looking at him then there was a good listener a painter in whose hall hung a big picture painted in his student days of ulysses sailing home from the phaeacian court an orange and a skin of wine at his side blue mountains towering behind but who lived by drawing domestic scenes and lovers meetings for a weekly magazine that had an immense circulation among the imperfectly educated to escape the bored,4

of the gate he is too far away for mother to call and besides i think she must have been a little uncertain for he did not so much as turn his head toward the house trembling with excitement she hurries little frank into his wagon and telling hattie to bring me sets off up the road as fast as she can draw the baby s cart it all seems a dream to me and i move dumbly almost stupidly like one in a mist we did not overtake the soldier that is evident for my next vision is that of a blue coated figure leaning upon the fence studying with intent gaze our empty cottage i cannot even now precisely divine why he stood thus sadly contemplating his silent home but so it was his knapsack lay at his feet his musket was propped against a post on whose top a cat was dreaming unmindful of the warrior and his folded hands he did not hear us until we were close upon him and even after he turned my mother hesitated so thin so hollow eyed so changed was he richard is that you she quaveringly asked his worn face lighted up his arms rose yes belle here i am he answered nevertheless though he took my mother in his arms i could not relate him to the father i had heard so much about to me he was only a strange man with big eyes and care worn face i did not recognize in him anything i had ever known but my sister who was two years older than i went to his bosom of her own motion she knew him whilst i submitted to his caresses rather for the reason that my mother urged me forward than because of any affection i felt for him frank however would not even permit a kiss the gaunt and grizzled stranger terrified him come here my little man my father said my little man across the space of half a century i can still hear the sad reproach in his voice won t you come and see your poor old father when he comes home from the war my little man how significant that phrase seems to me now the war had in very truth come between this patriot and his sons i had forgotten him the baby had never known him frank crept beneath the rail fence and stood there well out of reach like a cautious kitten warily surveying an alien dog at last the soldier stooped and drawing from his knapsack a big red apple held it toward the staring babe confidently calling now i guess he ll come to his poor old pap home from the war the mother apologized he doesn t know you dick how could he he was only nine months old when you went away he ll go to you by and by the babe crept slowly toward the shining lure my father caught him despite his kicking and hugged him close now i ve got you he exulted then we all went into the little front room and the soldier laid off his heavy army shoes my mother brought a pillow to put under his head and so at last he stretched out on the floor the better to rest his tired aching bones and there i joined him oh belle he said in tones of utter content this is what i ve dreamed about a million times frank and i grew each moment more friendly and soon began to tumble over him while mother hastened to cook something for him to eat he asked for hot biscuits and honey and plenty of coffee that was a mystic hour and yet how little i can recover of it the afternoon glides into evening while the soldier talks and at last we all go out to the barn to watch mother milk the cow i hear him ask about the crops the neighbors the sunlight passes mother leads the way back to the house my father follows carrying little frank in his arms he is a strange man no longer each moment his voice sinks deeper into my remembrance he is my father that i feel ringing through the dim halls of my consciousness harriet clings to his hand in perfect knowledge and confidence we eat our bread and milk the trundle bed is pulled out we children clamber in and i go to sleep to the music of his resonant voice recounting the story of the battles he had seen and the marches he had made the emergence of an individual consciousness from the void is after all the most amazing fact of human life and i should like to spend much of this first chapter in groping about in the luminous shadow of my infant world because deeply considered childish impressions are the fundamentals upon which an author s fictional out put is based but to linger might weary my reader at the outset although i count myself most fortunate in the fact that my boyhood was spent in the midst of a charming landscape and during a certain heroic era of western settlement the men and women of that far time loom large in my thinking for they possessed not only the spirit of adventurers but the courage of warriors aside from the natural distortion of a boy s imagination i am quite sure that the pioneers of still retained something broad and fine in their action something a boy might honorably imitate the earliest dim scene in my memory is that of a soft warm evening i am cradled in the lap of my sister harriet who is sitting on the door step beneath a low roof it is mid summer and at our feet lies a mat of dark green grass from which a frog is croaking the stars are out and above the high hills to the east a mysterious glow is glorifying the sky the cry of the small animal at last conveys to my sister s mind a notion of distress and rising she peers closely along the path starting back with a cry of alarm she calls and my mother hurries out she too examines the ground and at last points out to me a long striped snake with a poor shrieking little tree toad in its mouth the horror of this scene fixes it in my mind my mother beats the serpent with a stick the mangled victim hastens away and

hour he tried again when to his astonishment instantly the answer came back yes as distinctly as though she were standing by his side he heard his cousin mary s voice are you there he said quite hopelessly merely as a matter of form of very common form and well nigh fell to the ground when he received the reply yes yes but i have just been telegraphed for to go to beaulieu my mother is very ill what is the matter with her he asked and she replied inflammation of the lungs but i must stop i can t speak any more then came some sobs and silence that same afternoon by mary s direction the aerophone was brought back to him in a dog cart and three days later he heard that her mother mrs porson was dead some months passed and when they met again on her return from the riviera morris found his cousin changed she had parted from him a child and now beneath the shadow of the wings of grief suddenly she had become a woman moreover the best and frankest part of their intimacy seemed to have vanished there was a veil between them mary thought of little and at this time seemed to care for no one except her mother who was dead and morris who had loved the child recoiled somewhat from the new born woman it may be explained that he was afraid of women still with an eye to business he spoke to her about the aerophone and so far as her memory served her she confirmed all the details of their short conversation across the gulf of empty space you see he said trembling with excitement i have got it at last it looks like it she answered wearily her thoughts already far away why shouldn t you there are so many odd things of the sort but one can never be sure it mightn t work next time will you try again he asked if you like she answered but i don t believe i shall hear anything now somehow since that last business everything seems different to me don t be foolish he said you have nothing to do with the hearing it is my new receiver i daresay she replied but then why couldn t you make it work with other people morris answered nothing he too wondered why next morning they made the experiment it failed other experiments followed at intervals most of which were fiascos although some were partially successful thus at times mary could hear what he said but except for a word or two and now and then a sentence he could not hear her whom when she was still a child and his playmate once he had heard so clearly why is it he said a year or two later dashing his fist upon the table in impotent rage it has been why can t it be mary turned her large blue eyes up to the ceiling and reflectively rubbed her dimpled chin with a very pretty finger isn t that the kind of question they used to ask oracles she asked lazily oh no it was the oracles themselves that were so

smoothing her curling hair it s us you don t understand me a bit not now and that s why you can t hear me take my advice morris and she looked at him sharply when you find a woman whom you can hear on your patent receiver you had better marry her it will be a good excuse for keeping her at a distance afterwards then he lost his temper indeed he raved and stormed and nearly smashed the patent receiver in his fury to a scientific man let it be admitted it was nothing short of maddening to be told that the successful working of his instrument to the manufacture of which he had given eight years of toil and study depended upon some pre existent sympathy between the operators of its divided halves if that were so what was the use of his wonderful discovery for who could ensure a sympathetic correspondent and yet the fact remained that when in their playmate days he understood his cousin mary and when her quiet indolent nature had been deeply moved by the shock of the news of her mother s peril the aerophone had worked whereas now when she had become a grown up young lady he did not understand her any longer he whose heart was wrapped up in his experiments and who by nature feared the adult members of her sex and shrank from them when too her placid calm was no longer stirred work it would not she laughed at his temper then grew serious and said don t get angry morris after all there are lots of things that you and i can t understand and it isn t odd that you should have tumbled across one of them if you think of it nobody understands anything they know that certain things happen and how to make them happen but they don t know why they happen or why as in your case when they ought to happen they won t it is all very well for you to be philosophical he answered turning upon her but can t you see mary that the thing there is my life s work it is what i have given all my strength and all my brain to make and if it fails in the end why then i fail too

remember blue ruin cried the bacteriologist and incontinently ran to the front door and down the steps of his house to the street minnie hearing the door slam violently ran in alarm to the window down the street a slender man was getting into a cab the bacteriologist hatless and in his carpet slippers was running and gesticulating wildly towards this group one slipper came off but he did not wait for it he has gone mad said minnie it s that horrid science of his and opening the window would have called after him the slender man suddenly glancing round seemed struck with the same idea of mental disorder he pointed hastily to the bacteriologist said something to the cabman the apron of the cab slammed the whip swished the horse s feet clattered and in a moment cab and bacteriologist hotly in pursuit had receded up the vista of the roadway and disappeared round the corner minnie remained straining out of the window for a minute then she drew her head back into the room again she was dumbfounded of course he is eccentric she meditated but running about london in the height of the season too in his socks a happy thought struck her she hastily put her bonnet on seized his shoes went

can find a gentleman running about in a velveteen coat and no hat velveteen coat ma am and no at very good ma am and the cabman whipped up at once in the most matter of fact way as if he drove to this address every day in his life some few minutes later the little group of cabmen and loafers that collects round the cabmen s shelter at haverstock hill were startled by the passing of a cab with a ginger coloured screw of a horse driven furiously they were silent as it went by and then as it receded that s arry icks wot s he got said the stout gentleman known as old tootles he s a using his

nexst minnie went by in a perfect roar of applause she did not like it but she felt that she was doing her duty and whirled on down haverstock hill and camden town high street with her eyes ever intent on the animated back view of old george who was driving her vagrant husband so incomprehensibly away from her the man in the foremost cab sat crouched in the corner his arms tightly folded and the little tube that contained such vast possibilities of destruction gripped in his hand his mood was a singular mixture of fear and exultation chiefly he was afraid of being caught before he could accomplish his purpose but behind this was a vaguer but larger fear of the awfulness of his crime but his exultation far exceeded his fear no anarchist before him had ever approached this conception of his ravachol vaillant all those distinguished persons whose fame he had envied dwindled into insignificance beside him he had only to make sure of the water supply and break the little tube into a reservoir how brilliantly he had planned it forged the letter of introduction and got into the laboratory and how brilliantly he had seized his opportunity the world should hear of him at last all those people who had sneered at him neglected him preferred other people to him found his company undesirable should consider him at last death death death they had always treated him as a man of no importance all the world had been in a conspiracy to keep him under he would teach them yet what it is to isolate a man what was this familiar street great saint andrew s street of course how fared the chase he craned out of the cab the bacteriologist was scarcely fifty yards behind that was bad he would be caught and stopped yet he felt in his pocket for money and found half a sovereign this he thrust up through the trap in the top of the cab into the man s face more he shouted if only we get away the money was snatched out of his hand right you are said the cabman and the trap slammed and the lash lay along the glistening side of the horse the cab swayed and the anarchist half standing under the trap put the hand containing the little glass tube upon the apron to preserve his balance

a congenial and sympathetic companion in my extremity now that i have undertaken a story in which mrs sanderson and her son sidney so conspicuously figure i feel compelled to review carefully my early and subsequent impressions of both in order that the events of our short and memorable acquaintance may be readily understood doubtless my estimate of entire strangers would have been different under less intense circumstances but at that time any one who appeared interested in my child was at once my friend not only the conspicuous and influential but the humble and uncultivated as well looking back over those trying weeks i now remember hosts of delicate attentions dispensed by the unpretentious that at the time were hardly realized owing to the effusive ostentations of the sandersons since i have studied carefully the events which followed rapidly from the beginning of our acquaintance i am certain that neither marjorie nor myself would have received the slightest notice from either mrs sanderson or her son had we failed in their selfish entertainment my little girl beautiful and bright unconsciously stole into the coldest hearts but i know now that it was not her delicate frame nor the pathos of a defrauded childhood that won the devotion of mrs sanderson it was simply that marjorie was an additional amusement an additional effect enlivening the small court which the lady invariably held the capricious woman petted the child only for entertainment a thoroughbred dog or a kitten could have won her interest as successfully had her passing mood been favorable to their antics her fancy for myself was equally selfish i was young enough to interest her son and from the first she evidently regarded me as a convenient and suitable companion for the winter i learned afterwards that mrs sanderson was notoriously fond of young widows she treated them with unusual favor in view of eventual schemes which she generally worked her only idea of life was entertainment and in order to satisfy her thirst for novelty she had always chosen pretty widows to expand her power and promote her individual caprices unincumbered by the unreasonable demands of a husband she regarded a pathetic young widow a most desirable companion always securing if possible a fresh one for the nucleus of her social experiments why i should have submitted to this woman s patronage i can not understand my only excuse is the recollection of an unsuspicious joy that came like new life into my soul marjorie was getting well and there was no one who understood my happiness like mrs sanderson it never occurred to me to doubt her sincerity that she was often haughty and disagreeable to others i saw but for me she had only indulgence and delicate sympathy under calming climatic influences my pagan intuitions grew hourly beneath the lights and shadows of the prophetic mountains analytical tendencies ceased possibly my creeds became unorthodox but they expanded cheerfully each day that they might hold more of god s harmonious universe and less of man s deformity i believed afresh in universal philanthropy the sweet lethargic days were satisfying i had no desire to analyze the motives of my associates i was no longer interested in attenuated studies of character the book of nature and the literal tales of mother goose now constituted my library for the present the wise men of athens were no wiser than the man who so successfully evaded the consequences of the bramble bush now that my child had been given back to me no unnecessary suspicions disturbed my credulous content i had been tired so long that to rest at last necessarily developed passive conditions over which i had but languid control mrs sanderson crossing my path at this particular time appeared to be the very person to stimulate my reviving interest in life and i accepted eagerly and without analysis the friendship she offered from the first i had been fascinated by her alertness unconsciously i felt indebted to her for my renewed fortunes it was not until long afterward that i discovered how very little she really did for me or for anyone else when she appeared to be doing so much she always assumed the leadership of social affairs so cleverly that to have questioned her right would have proved fatal to the individual it was impossible to resist her personality when she chose to be engaging she was tall and slender with the established slenderness that emphasizes distinction at forty five when plump women often exhibit the ripeness of decay in a word mrs sanderson eclipsed completely her feminine contemporaries often exciting jealous antagonisms the lady s superior preservation was at times exasperating and her scornful indifference to topics usually interesting to middle life disconcerted and annoyed domestic women of her own age her infirmities she heroically concealed and was never surprised into the acknowledgement of a physical weakness the chronic afflictions of other women never moved her to sympathetic confidences in fact she avoided systematically the society of older women while she ingratiated herself irresistibly with young people of both sexes for these reasons mrs sanderson was frequently disliked but as few dared to oppose her openly her sway always grew to be absolute chapter ii mrs sanderson at the various stations of her social pilgrimage had managed to create fresh enthusiasms for every shrine each year found her alert substituting new images for those cast down and withal grading so ingeniously the declivities of time that the world failed to detect the skillful engineering because for her there had been none of those abrupt drops so disastrous to the grace of womanhood she was always in sympathy with the age for

in an agony of desperation he cried walpurgis nacht and pointed to the carriage for me to get in all my english blood rose at this and standing back i said you are afraid johann you are afraid go home i shall return alone the walk will do me good the carriage door was open i took from the seat my oak walking stick which i always carry on my holiday excursions and closed the door pointing back to munich and said go home johann walpurgis nacht doesn t concern englishmen the horses were now more restive than ever and johann was trying to hold them in while excitedly imploring me not to do anything so foolish i pitied the poor fellow he was deeply in earnest but all the same i could not help laughing his english was quite gone now in his anxiety he had forgotten that his only means of making me understand was to talk my language so he jabbered away in his native german it began to be a little tedious after giving the direction home i turned to go down the cross road into the valley with a despairing gesture johann turned his horses towards munich i leaned on my stick and looked after him he went slowly along the road for a while then there came over the crest of the hill a man tall and thin i could see so much in the distance when he drew near the horses they began to jump and kick about then to scream with terror johann could not hold them in they bolted down the road running away madly i watched them out of sight then looked for the stranger but i found that he too was gone with a light heart i turned down the side road through the deepening valley to which johann had objected there was not the slightest reason that i could see for his objection and i daresay i tramped for a couple of hours without thinking of time or distance and certainly without seeing a person or a house so far as the place was concerned it was desolation itself but i did not notice this particularly till on turning a bend in the road i came upon a scattered fringe of wood then i recognised that i had been impressed unconsciously by the desolation of the region through which i had passed i sat down to rest myself and began to look around it struck me that it was considerably colder than it had been at the commencement of my walk a sort of sighing sound seemed to be around me with now and then high overhead a sort of muffled roar looking upwards i noticed that great thick clouds were drifting rapidly across the sky from north to south at a great height there were signs of coming storm in some lofty stratum of the air i was a little chilly and thinking that it was the sitting still after the exercise of walking i resumed my journey the ground i passed over was now much more picturesque there were no striking objects that the eye might single out but in all there was a charm of beauty i took little heed of time and it was only when the deepening twilight forced itself upon me that i began to think of how i should find my way home the brightness of the day had gone the air was cold and the drifting of clouds high overhead was more marked they were accompanied by a sort of far away rushing sound through which seemed to come at intervals that mysterious cry which the driver had said came from a wolf for a while i hesitated i had said i would see the deserted village so on i went and presently came on a wide stretch of open country shut in by hills all around their sides were covered with trees which spread down to the plain dotting in clumps the gentler slopes and hollows which showed here and there i followed with my eye the winding of the road and saw that it curved close to one of the densest of these clumps and was lost behind it as i looked there came a cold shiver in the air and the snow began to fall i thought of the miles and miles of bleak country i had passed and then hurried on to seek the shelter of the wood in front darker and darker grew the sky and faster and heavier fell the snow till the earth before and around me was a glistening white carpet the further edge of which was lost in misty vagueness the road was here but crude and when on the level its boundaries were not so marked as when it passed through the cuttings

whose labours and some of the most remarkable of turgot s there was so much community we cannot tell how far the gulf between turgot and the earlier band was fixed by the accident that he did not belong to their generation in point of time the accident is in itself only worth calling attention to in connection with his distance from them in other and more important points than time footnote born in and respectively the years of turgot exactly bridge the interval between the ministry of the infamous dubois and the ministry of the inglorious calonne between the despair and confusion of the close of the regency and the despair and confusion of the last ten years of the monarchy in we stand on the threshold of that far resounding fiery workshop where a hundred hands wrought the cunning implements and cyclopean engines that were to serve in storming the hated citadels of superstition and injustice in we emerge from these subterranean realms into the open air to find ourselves surrounded by all the sounds and portents of imminent ruin this then is the significance of the date of turgot s birth his stock was norman and those who amuse themselves by finding a vital condition of the highest ability in antiquity of blood may quote the descent of turgot in support of their delusion his biographers speak of one togut a danish prince who walked the earth some thousand years before the christian era and of saint turgot in the eleventh century the prior of durham biographer of bede and first minister of malcolm iii of scotland we shall do well not to linger in this too dark and frigid air let us pass over togut and saint turgot and the founder of a hospital in the thirteenth century and the great great grandfather who sat as president of the norman nobles in the states general of and the grandfather who deserted arms for the toga history is hardly concerned in this solemn marshalling of shades even with michel etienne the father of turgot we have here no dealing let it suffice to say that he held high municipal office in paris and performed its duties with exceptional honour and spirit giving sumptuous f tes constructing useful public works and on one occasion jeoparding his life with a fine intrepidity that did not fail in his son in appeasing a bloody struggle between two bodies of swiss and french guards there is in the library of the british museum a folio of containing elaborate plates and letterpress descriptive of the f tes celebrated by the city of paris with michel etienne turgot as its chief officer on the occasion of the marriage of louise elizabeth of france to don philip of spain august as one contemplates these courtly sumptuosities la bruy re s famous picture recurs to the mind of far other scenes in the same gay land we see certain wild animals male and female scattered over the fields black livid all burnt by the sun bound to the earth that they dig and work with unconquerable pertinacity they have a sort of articulate voice and when they rise on their feet they show a human face in fact they are men that these violent and humiliating contrasts are eternal and inevitable is the last word of the dominant philosophy of society and one of the reasons why turgot s life is worth studying is that he felt in so pre eminent a degree the urgency of lightening the destiny of that livid wild hardly articulate ever toiling multitude the sum of the genealogical page is that turgot inherited that position which falling to worthy souls is of its nature so invaluable a family tradition of exalted courage and generous public spirit there have been noble and patriotic men who lacked this inheritance but we may be sure that even these would have fought the battle at greater advantage if a magnanimous preference for the larger interests had come to them as a matter of instinctive prejudice instead of being acquired as a matter of reason the question of titular aristocracy is not touched by this consideration for titular aristocracies postpone the larger interests to the narrow interests of their order and turgot s family was only of the secondary noblesse of the robe turgot was the third son of his father as the employments which persons of respectable family could enter were definite and stereotyped there was little room for debate as to the calling for which a youth should prepare himself arms civil administration and the church furnished the only three openings for a gentleman the effects of this rigorous adherence to artificial and exclusive rules of caste were manifestly injurious to society as such caste rules always are after a society has passed beyond a certain stage to identify the interests of the richest and most powerful class with the interests of the church of the army and of a given system of civil government was indeed to give to that class the strongest motives for leaving the existing social order undisturbed it unfortunately went too far in this direction by fostering the strongest possible motives of hostility to such modifications in these gigantic departments as changing circumstances might make needful in the breasts of the only men who could produce these modifications without a violent organic revolution such a system left too little course to spontaneity and its curse is the curse of french genius some of its evil effects were obvious and on the surface the man who should have been a soldier found himself saying mass and hearing confessions vauvenargues who was born for diplomacy or literature passed the flower of his days

'BYTHESAMEAUTHOR', 'HERETICS.', 'ORTHODOXY.', 'THENAPOLEONOFNOTTINGHILL:ARomance.', 'Illustra']",george bernard shaw the irishman the english public has commonly professed with a kind of pride that it cannot understand mr bernard shaw there are many reasons for it which ought to be adequately considered in such a book as this but the first and most obvious reason is the mere statement that george bernard shaw was born in dublin in at least one reason why englishmen cannot understand mr shaw is that englishmen have never taken the trouble to understand irishmen they will sometimes be generous to ireland but never just to ireland they will speak to ireland they will speak for ireland but they will not hear ireland speak all the real amiability which most englishmen undoubtedly feel towards irishmen is lavished upon a class of irishmen which unfortunately does not exist the irishman of the english farce with his brogue his buoyancy and his tender hearted irresponsibility is a man who ought to have been thoroughly pampered with praise and sympathy if he had only existed to receive them unfortunately all the time that we were creating a comic irishman in fiction we were creating a tragic irishman in fact never perhaps has there been a situation of such excruciating cross purposes even in the three act farce the more we saw in the irishman a sort of warm and weak fidelity the more he regarded us with a sort of icy anger the more the oppressor looked down with an amiable pity the more did the oppressed look down with a somewhat unamiable contempt but indeed it is needless to say that such comic cross purposes could be put into a play they have been put into a play they have been put into what is perhaps the most real of mr bernard shaw s plays john bull s other island it is somewhat absurd to imagine that any one who has not read a play by mr shaw will be reading a book about him but if it comes to that it is as i clearly perceive absurd to be writing a book about mr bernard shaw at all it is indefensibly foolish to attempt to explain a man whose whole object through life has been to explain himself but even in nonsense there is a need for logic and consistency therefore let us proceed on the assumption that when i say that all mr shaw s blood and origin may be found in john bull s other island some reader may answer that he does not know the play besides it is more important to put the reader right about england and ireland even than to put him right about shaw if he reminds me that this is a book about shaw i can only assure him that i will reasonably and at proper intervals remember the fact mr shaw himself said once i am a typical irishman my family came from yorkshire scarcely anyone but a typical irishman could have made the remark it is in fact a bull a conscious bull a bull is only a paradox which people are too stupid to understand it is the rapid summary of something which is at once so true and so complex that the speaker who has the swift intelligence to perceive it has not the slow patience to explain it mystical dogmas are much of this kind dogmas are often spoken of as if they were signs of the slowness or endurance of the human mind as a matter of fact they are marks of mental promptitude and lucid impatience a man will put his meaning mystically because he cannot waste time in putting it rationally dogmas are not dark and mysterious rather a dogma is like a flash of lightning an instantaneous lucidity that opens across a whole landscape of the same nature are irish bulls they are summaries which are too true to be consistent the irish make irish bulls for the same reason that they accept papal bulls it is because it is better to speak wisdom foolishly like the saints rather than to speak folly wisely like the dons this is the truth about mystical dogmas and the truth about irish bulls it is also the truth about the paradoxes of bernard shaw each of them is an argument impatiently shortened into an epigram each of them represents a truth hammered and hardened with an almost disdainful violence until it is compressed into a small space until it is made brief and almost incomprehensible the case of that curt remark about ireland and yorkshire is a very typical one if mr shaw had really attempted to set out all the sensible stages of his joke the sentence would have run something like this that i am an irishman is a fact of psychology which i can trace in many of the things that come out of me my fastidiousness my frigid fierceness and my distrust of mere pleasure but the thing must be tested by what comes from me do not try on me the dodge of asking where i came from how many batches of three hundred and sixty five days my family was in ireland do not play any games on me about whether i am a celt a word that is dim to the anthropologist and utterly unmeaning to anybody else do not start any drivelling discussions about whether the word shaw is german or scandinavian or iberian or basque you know you are human i know i am irish i know i belong to a certain type and temper of society and i know that all sorts of people of all sorts of blood live in that society and by that society and are therefore irish you can take your books of anthropology to hell or to oxford thus gently elaborately and at length mr shaw would have explained his meaning if he had thought it worth his while as he did not he merely flung the symbolic but very complete sentence i am a typical irishman my family came from yorkshire what then is the colour of this irish society of which bernard shaw with all his individual oddity is yet an essential type one generalisation i think may at least be made ireland has in it a quality which caused it in the most ascetic age of christianity to be called the land of saints and which still might give it a claim to be called the land of virgins an irish catholic priest once said to me there is in our people a fear of t,3

especially the gentlemen are much more what i should call attentive i don t know whether americans are more sincere i haven t yet made up my mind about that the only drawback i experience is when americans sometimes express surprise that i should be travelling round alone so you see it doesn t come from europeans i always have my answer ready for general culture to acquire the languages and to see europe for myself and that generally seems to satisfy them dear mother my money holds out very well and it is real interesting chapter ii from the same to the same september th since i last wrote to you i have left that hotel and come to live in a french family it s a kind of boarding house combined with a kind of school only it s not like an american hoarding house nor like an american school either there are four or five people here that have come to learn the language not to take lessons but to have an opportunity for conversation i was very glad to come to such a place for i had begun to realise that i was not making much progress with the french it seemed to me that i should feel ashamed to have spent two months in paris and not to have acquired more insight into the language i had always heard so much of french conversation and i found i was having no more opportunity to practise it than if i had remained at bangor in fact i used to hear a great deal more at bangor from those french canadians that came down to cut the ice than i saw i should ever hear at that hotel the lady that kept the books seemed to want so much to talk to me in english for the sake of practice too i suppose that i couldn t bear to let her know i didn t like it the chambermaid was irish and all the waiters were german so that i never heard a word of french spoken i suppose you might hear a great deal in the shops only as i don t buy anything i prefer to spend my money for purposes of culture i don t have that advantage i have been thinking some of taking a teacher but i am well acquainted with the grammar already and teachers always keep you bothering over the verbs i was a good deal troubled for i felt as if i didn t want to go away without having at least got a general idea of french conversation the theatre gives you a good deal of insight and as i told you in my last i go a good deal to places of amusement i find no difficulty whatever in going to such places alone and am always treated with the politeness which as i told you before i encounter everywhere i see plenty of other ladies alone mostly french and they generally seem to be enjoying themselves as much as i but at the theatre every one talks so fast that i can scarcely make out what they say and besides there are a great many vulgar expressions which it is unnecessary to learn but it was the theatre nevertheless that put me on the track the very next day after i wrote to you last i went to the palais royal which is one of the principal theatres in paris it is very small but it is very celebrated and in my guide book it is marked with two stars which is a sign of importance attached only to first class objects of interest but after i had been there half an hour i found i couldn t understand a single word of the play they gabbled it off so fast and they made use of such peculiar expressions i felt a good deal disappointed and troubled i was afraid i shouldn t gain all i had come for but while i was thinking it over thinking what i should do i heard two gentlemen talking behind me it was between the acts and i couldn t help listening to what they said they were talking english but i guess they were americans well said one of them it all depends on what you are after i m french that s what i m after well said the other i m after art well said the first i m after art

you want to go right through the louvre room by room you want to take a room a day or something of that sort but if you want to acquire french the thing is to look out for a family there are lots of

observations too light and superficial as others have done before me this letter will divide the weighty task and consequently make it sit lighter on the memory be pleasanter to the reader and make my progress the more regular i shall therefore take in hampton court and windsor in this journey the first at my setting out and the last at my return and the rest as their situation demands as i came down from kingston in my last circuit by the south bank of the thames on the surrey side of the river so i go up to hampton court now on the north bank and on the middlesex side which i mention because as the sides of the country bordering on the river lie parallel so the beauty of the country the pleasant situations the glory of innumerable fine buildings noblemen s and gentlemen s houses and citizens retreats are so equal a match to what i had described on the other side that one knows not which to give the preference to but as i must speak of them again when i come to write of the county of middlesex which i have now purposely omitted so i pass them over here except the palace of hampton only which i mentioned in middlesex for the reasons above hampton court lies on the north bank of the river thames about two small miles from kingston and on the road from staines to kingston bridge so that the road straightening the parks a little they were obliged to part the parks and leave the paddock and the great park part on the other side the road a testimony of that just regard that the kings of england always had and still have to the common good and to the service of the country that they would not interrupt the course of the road or cause the poor people to go out of the way of their business to or from the markets and fairs for any pleasure of their own whatsoever the palace of hampton court was first founded and built from the ground by that great statesman and favourite of king henry viii cardinal wolsey and if it be a just observation anywhere as is made from the situation of the old abbeys and monasteries the clergy were excellent judges of the beauty and pleasantness of the country and chose always to plant in the best i say if it was a just observation in any case it was in this for if there be a situation on the whole river between staines bridge and windsor bridge pleasanter than another it is this of hampton close to the river yet not offended by the rising of its waters in floods or storms near to the reflux of the tides but not quite so near as to be affected with any foulness of the water which the flowing of the tides generally is the occasion of the gardens extend almost to the bank of the river yet are never overflowed nor are there any marshes on either side the river to make the waters stagnate or the air unwholesome on that account the river is high enough to be navigable and low enough to be a little pleasantly rapid so that the stream looks always cheerful not slow and sleeping like a pond this keeps the waters always clear and clean the bottom in view the fish playing and in sight and in a word it has everything that can make an inland or as i may call it a country river pleasant and agreeable i shall sing you no songs here of the river in the first person of a water nymph a goddess and i know not what according to the humour of the ancient poets i shall talk nothing of the marriage of old isis the male river with the beautiful thame the female river a whimsey as simple as the subject was empty but i shall speak of the river as occasion presents as it really is made glorious by the splendour of its shores gilded with noble palaces strong fortifications large hospitals and public buildings with the greatest bridge and the greatest city in the world made famous by the opulence of its merchants the increase and extensiveness of its commerce by its invincible navies and by the innumerable fleets of ships sailing upon it to and from all parts of the world as i meet with the river upwards in my travels through the inland country i shall speak of it as it is the channel for conveying an infinite quantity of provisions from remote counties to london and enriching all the counties,3

open air accompanied by one or two companions sons of the clansmen he would start soon after daybreak and not return until sunset when they would often bring back a deer from the forests or a heavy creel of salmon or trout from the streams his mother encouraged him in these excursions and also in the practice of arms she confined her lessons to the evening and even after she settled on her recovered farm of kilgowrie and obtained the services of a tutor for him she arranged that he should still be permitted to pass the greater part of the day according to his own devices she herself was a cousin of the two brothers keith the one of whom then lord marischal had proclaimed the old pretender king at edinburgh and both of whom had attained very high rank abroad the younger keith having served with great distinction in the spanish and russian armies and had then taken service under frederick the great from whom he had received the rank of field marshal and was the king s greatest counsellor and friend his brother had joined him there and stood equally high in the king s favour although both were devoted jacobites and had risked all at the first rising in favour of the old pretender neither had taken part in that of charles edward seeing that it was doomed to failure after culloden james keith the field marshal had written to his cousin mrs drummond as follows dear cousin i have heard with grief from alexander grahame who has come over here to escape the troubles of the grievous loss that has befallen you he tells me that when in hiding among the mountains he learned that you had with your boy taken refuge with ian the forester whom i well remember when i was last staying with your good husband sir john he also said that your estates had been confiscated but that he was sure you would be well cared for by your clansmen grahame told me that he stayed with you for a few hours while he was flying from cumberland s bloodhounds and that you told him you intended to remain there and to devote yourself to the boy s education until better times came i doubt not that ere long when the hot blood that has been stirred up by this rising has cooled down somewhat milder measures will be used and some mercy be shown but it may be long for the hanoverian has been badly frightened and the whigs throughout the country greatly scared and this for the second time i am no lover of the usurper but i cannot agree with all that has been said about the severity of the punishment that has been dealt out i have been fighting all over europe and i know of no country where a heavy reckoning would not have been made after so serious an insurrection men who take up arms against a king know that they are staking their lives but after vengeance comes pardon and the desire to heal wounds and i trust that you will get some portion of your estate again it is early yet to think of what you are going to make of the boy but i am sure you will not want to see him fighting in the hanoverian uniform so if he has a taste for adventure let him when the time comes make his way out to me or if i should be under the sod by that time let him go to my brother there will methinks be no difficulty in finding out where we are for there are so many scotch abroad that news of us must often come home however from time to time i will write to you do not expect to hear too often for i spend far more time in the saddle than at my table and my fingers are more accustomed to grasp a sword than a pen however be sure that wherever i may be i shall be glad to see your son and to do my best for him see that he is not brought up at your apron string but is well trained in all exercises for we scots have gained a great name for strength and muscle and i would not that one of my kin should fall short of the mark maggie drummond had been much pleased with her kinsman s letter there were few scotchmen who stood higher in the regard of their countrymen and the two keiths had also a european reputation her husband and many other fiery spirits had expressed surprise and even indignation that the brothers who had taken so prominent a part in the first rising should not have hastened to join prince charlie but the more thoughtful men felt it was a bad omen that they did not do so it was certainly not from any want of adventurous spirit or of courage for wherever adventures were to be obtained wherever blows were most plentiful james keith and his brother were certain to be in the midst of them but maggie drummond knew the reason for their holding aloof for she had shortly before the coming over of prince charlie received a short note from the field marshal they say that prince charles edward is meditating a mad scheme of crossing to scotland and raising his standard there if so do what you can to prevent your husband from joining him we made but a poor hand of it last time and the chances of success are vastly smaller now then it was but a comparatively short time since the stuarts had lost the throne of england and there were great numbers who wished them back now the hanoverian is very much more firmly seated on the throne the present man has a considerable army and the troops have had experience of war on the continent and have shown themselves rare soldiers were not my brother lord marischal of scotland and my name somewhat widely known i should not hang back from the adventure however desperate but our example might lead many who might otherwise stand aloof to take up arms which would bring i think sure destruction upon them therefore we shall restrain our own inclinations and shall watch what i feel sure will be a terrible tragedy from a distance striking perhaps somewhat heavier blows than usual u,3

the rover boys had expected to go back to putnam hall but a scarlet fever scare caused a temporary closing of that institution of learning and the lads took a trip to the pacific coast and were cast away on the ocean as told of in the rover boys on land and sea the seventh volume of this series but all came back safely and returned to the hall there to do their duty and have considerable fun as set forth in the rover boys in camp the boys uncle randolph rover had taken an elegant houseboat for debt this craft was located on the ohio river and in a volume called the rover boys on the river i related how sam tom and dick resolved to take a trip on the craft during their summer vacation on this outing they were accompanied by songbird powell a school chum given to the making of doggerel which he persisted in calling poetry fred garrison who had stood by the rovers through thick and thin and hans mueller a german youth who had not yet fully mastered the english language to make the trip more interesting the boys invited an old friend mrs stanhope to accompany them and also mrs laning her sister with mrs stanhope was a daughter dora who dick rover thought was the best and sweetest girl in the whole world and with mrs laning were her daughters grace and nellie warm friends of tom and sam the trip on the houseboat started well enough but soon came trouble through the underhanded work of dan baxter a big youth who had been the rovers bitter enemy ever since they had gone to putnam hall and another boy named lew flapp these young rascals ran off with the houseboat and two of the girls and it took hard work to regain the craft and come to the girls rescue lew flapp was made a prisoner and sent east to stand trial for some of his numerous misdeeds but dan baxter escaped we don t want to see any more of baxter sam had said but this wish was not to be gratified floating down the mississippi the houseboat got damaged in a big storm and had to be laid up for repairs this being so all on board decided to take a trip inland and accordingly they set out the ladies and girls by way of the railroad and the boys on horseback as already told in the rover boys on the plains this trip was full of mystery and peril dan baxter turned up most unexpectedly and our friends visited a mysterious ranch only to learn that it was a rendezvous for a band of counterfeiters through a government detective the counterfeiters were rounded up only one man sack todd escaping dan baxter also got away but later on he was traced to a big swamp where his horse was found stuck fast in the slimy ooze it was thought by some that baxter had lost his life trying to find his way through the swamp but of this the rovers were somewhat doubtful after the capture of the counterfeiters the boys and their chums had gone on to meet the ladies and the girls and had spent a full week at the ranch of a friend having the best times possible horseback riding hunting and helping to round up cattle then the whole party had gone back to the mississippi embarked on the dora as the houseboat was named and floated down the mighty stream once more this sort of thing is simply grand fred garrison had remarked as he stood on the forward deck of the craft yet an hour later he had changed his tune the houseboat had gone whirling in a bend of the stream struck a snag and hurled poor fred overboard he was hauled up by sam and dick rover and then it was ascertained that the houseboat was leaking and would have to be laid up again for repairs they had stopped at the town of shapette a small place and there they found a carpenter who promised to do what they wanted when the houseboat was laid up the captain had come to them with a letter my brother in cairo is dead said captain starr i shall have to leave you and look after his children the captain was an eccentric individual and the rovers did not like him much so they were perfectly willing to let him go they decided to look around for somebody else to manage the houseboat and in the meantime run the craft themselves with the party as cook and general housekeeper was alexander pop a colored man who had once been a waiter at putnam hall but who was now attached to the rover household the boys had expected to leave aleck as he was called in charge of the dora while they visited a nearby sugar plantation but the colored man had begged to be taken along jes fo de change as he expressed it as aleck had remained on the houseboat during the entire time the boys were on the plains dick agreed to take him along and thus for the time being the dora had been left in the sole care of the planter after the visit to the sugar plantation the party had ridden to shapette to do a little shopping before returning to the houseboat there tom and sam had left the others to make certain that the dora was in proper trim to continue the trip down the mississippi on the way sam stopped at a plantation house to get a drink of water and when he rejoined his brother it was to learn the dismaying news that the houseboat and the man left in charge of the craft had mysteriously disappeared chapter ii about a missing houseboat let us go down the river and see if the dora is behind yonder trees suggested sam after he had had time to digest what his brother had said all right if you say so

was always urging him to chuck art and go into the jute business and start at the bottom and work his way up jute had apparently become a sort of obsession with him he seemed to attach almost a spiritual importance to it and what corky said was that while he didn t know what they did at the bottom of the jute business instinct told him that it was something too beastly for words corky moreover believed in his future as an artist some day he said he was going to make a hit meanwhile by using the utmost tact and persuasiveness he was inducing his uncle to cough up very grudgingly a small quarterly allowance he wouldn t have got this if his uncle hadn t had a hobby mr worple was peculiar in this respect as a rule from what i ve observed the american captain of industry doesn t do anything out of business hours when he has put the cat out and locked up the office for the night he just relapses into a state of coma from which he emerges only to start being a captain of industry again but mr worple in his spare time was what is known as an ornithologist he had written a book called american birds and was writing another to be called more american birds when he had finished that the presumption was that he would begin a third and keep on till the supply of american birds gave out corky used to go to him about once every three months and let him talk about american birds apparently you could do what you liked with old worple if you gave him his head first on his pet subject so these little chats used to make corky s allowance all right for the time being but it was pretty rotten for the poor chap there was the frightful suspense you see and apart from that birds except when broiled and in the society of a cold bottle bored him stiff to complete the character study of mr worple he was a man of extremely uncertain temper and his general tendency was to think that corky was a poor chump and that whatever step he took in any direction on his own account was just another proof of his innate idiocy i should imagine jeeves feels very much the same about me so when corky trickled into my apartment one afternoon shooing a girl in front of him and said bertie i want you to meet my fianc e miss singer the aspect of the matter which hit me first was precisely the one which he had come to consult me about the very first words i spoke were corky how about your uncle the poor chap gave one of those mirthless laughs he was looking anxious and worried like a man who has done the murder all right but can t think what the deuce to do with the body we re so scared mr wooster said the girl we were hoping that you might suggest a way of breaking it to him muriel singer was one of those very quiet appealing girls who have a way of looking at you with their big eyes as if they thought you were the greatest thing on earth and wondered that you hadn t got on to it yet yourself she sat there in a sort of shrinking way looking at me as if she were saying to herself oh i do hope this great strong man isn t going to hurt me she gave a fellow a protective kind of feeling made him want to stroke her hand and say there there little one or words to that effect she made me feel that there was nothing i wouldn t do for her she was rather like one of those innocent tasting american drinks which creep imperceptibly into your system so that before you know what you re doing you re starting out to reform the world by force if necessary and pausing on your way to tell the large man in the corner that if he looks at you like that you will knock his head off what i mean is she made me feel alert and dashing like a jolly old knight errant or something of that kind i felt that i was with her in this thing to the limit i don t see why your uncle shouldn t be most awfully bucked i said to corky he will think miss singer the ideal wife for you corky declined to cheer up you don t know him even if he did like muriel he wouldn t admit it that s the sort of pig headed guy he is it would be a matter of principle with him to kick all he would consider would be that i had gone and taken an important step without asking his advice and he would raise cain automatically he s always done it i strained the old bean to meet this emergency you want to work it so that he makes miss singer s acquaintance without knowing that you know her then you come along but how can i work it that way i saw his point that was the catch there s only one thing to do i said what s that leave it to jeeves and i rang the bell sir said jeeves kind of manifesting himself one of the rummy things about jeeves is that unless you watch like a hawk you very seldom see him come into a room he s like one of those weird chappies in india who dissolve themselves into thin air and nip through space in a sort of disembodied way and assemble the parts again just where they want them i ve got a cousin who s what they call a theosophist and he says he s often nearly worked the thing himself but couldn t quite bring it off probably owing to having fed in his boyhood on the flesh of animals slain in anger and pie the moment i saw the man standing there registering respectful attention a weight seemed to roll off my mind i felt like a lost child who spots his father in the offing there was something about him that gave me confidence jeeves is a tallish man with one of those dark shrewd faces his eye gleams with the light of pure intelligence jeeves we want your advice very good sir i boiled down corky s painful case into a few well chosen words so you see what it

will be dangerous even now she is overloaded i looked at the man in amazement he had spoken earnestly but he was as calm as if we were standing on a sidewalk and he endeavoring to dissuade me from boarding an overcrowded street car before i could say anything he spoke again i am going to remain on this ship she is a hundred times safer than any of those boats i have had a great deal of experience in regard to vessels and ocean navigation and it will be a long time before this vessel sinks if she ever sinks of her own accord she s just as likely to float as that derelict we ran into the steam is nearly out of her boilers by this time and nothing is likely to happen to her i wish you would stay with me here we will be safe with plenty of room and plenty to eat and drink when it is daylight we will hoist a flag of distress which will be much more likely to be seen than anything that can flutter from those little boats if you have noticed sir the inclination of this deck is not greater now than it was half an hour ago that proves that our bow has settled down about as far as it is going i think it likely that the water has entered only a few of the forward compartments the man spoke so confidently that his words made an impression upon me i knew that it very often happens that a wreck floats for a long time and the boat from which the men were now frantically shouting for the captain would certainly be dangerously crowded stay with me said mr crowder and i assure you with as much reason as any man can assure any other man of anything in this world that you will be perfectly safe this steamer is not going to sink there were rapid footsteps and i saw the captain and his second officer approaching step back here said mr crowder pulling me by the coat don t let them see us they may drag us on board that confounded boat keep quiet sir and let them get off they think they are the last on board involuntarily i obeyed him and we stood in the shadow of the great funnel the captain had reached the rail is every one in the boats he shouted in french and in english is every one in the boats i am going to leave the vessel i made a start as if to rush toward him but crowder held me by the arm don t you do it he whispered very earnestly i have the greatest possible desire to save you stay where you are and you will be all right that overloaded boat may capsize in half an hour illustration don t you do it i could not help it i believed him my own judgment seemed suddenly to rise up and ask me why i should leave the solid deck of the steamer for that perilous little boat i need say but little more in regard to this shipwreck when the fog lifted about ten o clock in the morning we could see no signs of any of the boats a mile or so away lay the dull black line of the derelict as if she were some savage beast who had bitten and torn us and was now sullenly waiting to see us die of the wound we hoisted a flag union down and then we went below to get some breakfast mr crowder knew all about the ship and where to find everything he told me he had made so many voyages that he felt almost as much at home on sea as on land we made ourselves comfortable all day and at night we went to our rooms and i slept fairly well although there was a very disagreeable slant to my berth the next day early in the afternoon our signal of distress was seen by a tramp steamer on her way to new york and we were taken off we cruised about for many hours in the direction the boats had probably taken and the next day we picked up two of them in a sorry condition the occupants having suffered many hardships and privations we never had news of the captain s boat but the others were rescued by a sailing vessel going eastward before we reached new york mr crowder had made me promise that i would spend a few days with him at his home in that city his family was small he told me a wife and a daughter about six and he wanted me to know them naturally we had become great friends very likely the man had saved my life and he had done it without any act of heroism or daring but simply by impressing me with the fact that his judgment was better than mine i am apt to object to people of superior judgment but mr crowder was an exception to the ordinary superior person from the way he talked it was plain that he had much experience of various sorts and that he had greatly advantaged thereby but he gave himself no airs on this account and there was nothing patronizing about him if i were able to tell him anything he did not know and i frequently was he was very glad to hear it moreover mr crowder was a very good man to look at he was certainly over fifty and his closely trimmed hair was white but he had a fresh and florid complexion he was tall and well made fashionably dressed and had an erect and somewhat military carriage he was fond of talking and seemed fond of me and these points in his disposition attracted me very much my relatives were few they lived in the west and i never had had a friend whose company was so agreeable to me as that of mr crowder mr crowder s residence was a handsome house in the upper part of the city his wife was a slender lady scarcely half his age with a sweet and interesting face and was attired plainly but tastefully in general appearance she seemed to be the opposite of her husband in every way she had suffered a week of anxiety and was so rejoiced at having her husband again that when i met her some hours after crowder had reached the house her glorified face seemed like that of an angel but there

won t be in quite such a hurry to tell lies about me another time though i suppose that one must always expect a certain amount of lying from a half bred beggar like you like mother like son you know this last sentence was accompanied by a bitter laugh and produced a decided effect on the grovelling george who slowly raised himself upon his hands and lifting his head looked his cousin full in the face it was not the ghastly appearance of his mangled and blood soaked countenance that made philip recoil so sharply from the sight of his own handiwork he had fought too often at school to be chicken hearted about a little bloodshed and besides he knew that his cousin was only knocked about not really injured but rather the intense and almost devilish malignity of the expression that hovered on the blurred features and in the half closed eyes but no attempt was made by george to translate the look into words and indeed philip felt that it was untranslatable he also felt dimly that the hate and malice with which he was regarded by the individual at his feet was of a more concentrated and enduring character than most men have the power to originate in the lurid light of that one glance he was able though he was not very clever to pierce the darkest recesses of his cousin s heart and to see his inmost thought no longer through a veil but face to face and what he saw was sufficient to make the blood leave his ruddy cheek and to fix his eyes into an expression of fear next second george dropped his head on to the ground again and began to moan in an ostentatious manner possibly in order to attract some one whose footsteps could be plainly heard proceeding slowly down a shrubbery path on the other side of the yard wall at any rate that was the effect produced for next moment before philip could think of escape had he wished to escape a door in the wall was opened and a gentleman pausing on the threshold surveyed the whole scene with the assistance of a gold mounted eye glass with some evident surprise and little apparent satisfaction the old gentleman for he was old made so pretty a picture framed as he was in the arched doorway and set off by a natural background of varying shades of green that his general appearance is worth sketching as he stood to begin with he was dressed in the fashion of the commencement of this century and as has been said old though it was difficult to say how old indeed so vigorous and comparatively youthful was his bearing that he was generally taken to be considerably under seventy but as a matter of fact he was but a few years short of eighty he was extremely tall over six feet and stood upright as a lifeguardsman indeed his height and stately carriage would alone have made him a remarkable looking man had there been nothing else unusual about him but as it happened his features were as uncommon as his person they were clear cut and cast in a noble mould the nose was large and aquiline the chin like his son philip s square and determined but it was his eyes that gave a painful fascination to his countenance they were steely blue and glittered under the pent house of his thick eyebrows that in striking contrast to the snow white of his hair were black in hue as tempered steel glitters in a curtained room it was those eyes in conjunction with sundry little peculiarities of temper that had earned for the old man the title of devil caresfoot a sobriquet in which he took peculiar pride so pleased was he with it indeed that he caused it to be engraved in solid oak letters an inch long upon the form of a life sized and life like portrait of himself that hung over the staircase in the house i am determined he would say to his son to be known to my posterity as i was known to my contemporaries the picture represents my person not inaccurately from the nickname my descendants will be able to gather what the knaves and fools with whom i lived thought of my character ah boy i am wearing out people will soon be staring at that portrait and wondering if it was like me in a very few years i shall no longer be devil but devilled and he would chuckle at his grim and ill omened joke philip felt his father s eyes playing upon him and shrunk from them his face had at the mere thought of the consequences of his chastisement of his cousin lost the beauty and animation that had clothed it a minute before now it grew leaden and hard the good died away from it altogether and instead of a young god bright with vengeance there was nothing but a sullen youth with dull and frightened eyes to his son as to most people who came under his influence devil caresfoot was a grave reality presently the picture in the doorway opened its mouth and spoke in a singularly measured gentle voice you will forgive me philip for interrupting your tete a tete but may i ask what is the meaning of this philip returned no answer since your cousin is not in a communicative mood george perhaps you will inform me why you are lying on your face and groaning in that unpleasant and aggressive manner george lifted his blood stained face from the stones and looking at his uncle groaned louder than ever may i ask you philip if george has fallen down and hurt himself or if there has been an an altercation between you here george himself got up and before philip could make any reply addressed himself to his uncle sir he said i will answer for philip there has been an altercation and he in the scuffle knocked me down and i confess here he put his hand up to his battered face that i am suffering a good

besides he frightens the fish which you are in too good training to do marian said mrs wortley and how is your papa to day oh it is a good day said marian he was up before we set off down stairs for perhaps we had better not go now just after he is tired with coming down said mrs wortley now mr arundel you will tell me honestly and this arrowroot will do just as well another time or if marian will carry home the message well said edmund smiling to give you a proof of my sincerity i think you had better perhaps go rather later in the day my uncle very unnecessarily hurried himself thinking that he was keeping me waiting to help him down stairs and i thought he seemed rather tired but he will be very glad to see you in the afternoon indeed he would be very glad now only you asked me as a question of prudence don t make civil speeches at the end to spoil just such a reply as i wanted said mrs wortley i am afraid you do not think sir edmund much better since you were last at home edmund shook his head if he has not lost ground it is well said he and i think at least there is less pain well i will not keep you any longer said mrs wortley good bye and good sport to you and with a wave of the hand on rode the two cousins edmund and marian arundel what an excellent thing it is for the village that those wortleys are come said edmund yes now that mamma cannot attend much to the school and poor people i don t know what we should do without them how different it was in old mr may s time i hope we shall get the church set to rights now when papa is well enough to attend to it it is high time certainly said edmund our church is almost a disgrace to us especially with the arundel aisle to show what our ancestors did no not quite to us said marian you know papa would have done it all long ago if the idea had not vexed poor old mr may so much but ranger ranger where is ranger edmund edmund whistled and presently with whirring rushing wing there flew over the hedge beside them a covey of partridges followed by ranger s eager bark marian s pony started danced and capered edmund watched her with considerable anxiety but she reined it in with a steady dexterous though not a strong hand kept her seat well and rode on in triumph while edmund exclaimed capital marian then looking back what a shot that was he added in a sort of parenthesis continuing i am proud mayflower is not a bit too much for you now though i think we must have given her up if you had had another tumble oh no no i do so delight in mayflower pretty creature said marian patting her neck i like to feel that the creature i ride is alive not an old slug like that animal which you are upon edmund that is decidedly ungrateful of you marian when you learnt to ride upon this identical slug and owe the safety of your neck to its quiet propensities now take care down this stony hill hold her up well that is right care was certainly needed as they descended the steep hill side the road or rather pathway cut out between high steep limestone rocks and here and there even bare of earth any one but a native would have trembled at such a descent but though the cousins paid attention to their progress they had no doubts or alarms at the bottom a clear sparkling stream traversed the road where for the convenience of foot passengers a huge flat stone had been thrown across from one high bank to the other so as to form a romantic bridge marian however did not avail herself of it but rode gallantly through the shallow water only looking back at it to observe to edmund we must make a sketch of that some day or other i am afraid we cannot get far enough off said edmund to make a good drawing of it too many things go to the making of the picturesque yes i know but that is what i never can understand i see by woeful experience that what is pretty in itself will not make a pretty drawing and everyone says so but i never could find out why perhaps because we cannot represent it adequately yes but there is another puzzle you sometimes see an exact representation which is not really a picture at all don t you know that thing that the man who came to the door did of our house the trees all green and the sky all blue and the moors all purple as like as it can stare yes i know well why does that not satisfy us why is it not a picture because it stares i suppose why does not that picture of my aunt at mrs week s cottage satisfy you as well as the chalk sketch in the dining room because it has none of herself her spirit well i should say that nature has a self and a spirit which must be caught or else the chinese would be the greatest artists on the face of the earth yes but why does an archway or two trees standing up so as to enclose the landscape or or any of those things that do to put in the foreground why do they enable you to make a picture to catch this self and spirit make the phial to enclose the genie said edmund abstruse questions marian but perhaps it is because they contract the space so as to bring it more to the level of our capacity make it less grand and more what we can get into keeping to be sure he would be a presumptuous man who tried to make an exact likeness of that he added as they reached the top of the hill and found themselves on an open common with here and there a mass of rock peeping up but for the most part covered with purple heath and short furze through which ranger coursed barking joyously the view was splendid on one side the moors rising one behind the other till they faded in grey distance each crowned with a fantastic pile of rocks one in,3

a collection of the smaller american animals and a bob cat is something like a big english ferret it has high hindquarters and walks with a curious jump which i suppose is why it got its name i m not sure it lives in canada and an american got this one for me i find natural history interesting margaret keith was known to be eccentric and her companion laughed i should imagine you found it expensive and aren t some of the creatures savage millicent looks after them and i always beat the sellers down fortunately i can afford to indulge in my caprices and you can consider this my latest fad if you like i am subject to no claims and my means are hardly large enough to make me an object of interest to sycophantic relatives is your companion fond of attending to wild animals mrs ashborne inquired i have wondered where you got her you have had a number but she is different from the rest i suppose you mean she is too good for the post mrs keith suggested however i don t mind telling you that she is eustace graham s daughter you must have heard of him eustace graham wasn t he in rather bad odour only tolerated on the fringe of society i seem to recollect some curious tales about him latterly he was outside the fringe indeed i don t know how he kept on his feet so long but he went downhill fast towards the end a plucker of plump pigeons an expensive friend to smart young subalterns and boys about town cards bets loans arranged and that kind of thing all the same he had his good points when i first knew him but after such a life as his daughter must have led do you consider her a suitable person to take about with you what do your friends think they have to receive her now and then i can t say that i have much cause to respect my friends opinions and i m not afraid of the girl s contaminating me mrs keith replied besides millicent who lost her mother early lived with her aunts until a few months before her father s death i expect eustace felt more embarrassed than grateful when she came to take care of him but to do him justice he would see that none of the taint of his surroundings rested on the girl he did wrong but i think he paid for it and it is better to be charitable she broke off and glanced down at the big liner with cream coloured funnel that was slowly swinging across the stream as she resumed i must send millicent to buy our

the stylish woman whom sedgwick had joined yes she said a widow i believe though one would not suspect it from her clothes she seems to know some of my friends but i met her here for the first time a few days ago she married very young and her husband who died in a few years left her a good deal of money he was a merchant in calcutta she s too smart and advanced for my taste but her people have some standing it looks as if she were attracted by sedgwick she s undoubtedly gracious to him then it s an opportunity he won t miss the man s an adventurer sedgwick and his companion passed out of sight and mrs ashborne opened the morning post from which she presently looked up a marriage between blanche newcombe and captain challoner at thornton holme in shropshire she read out do you know the bride i know bertram challoner better mrs keith replied and was silent for a minute or two musing on former days then she went on his mother was an old friend of mine a woman of imagination with strong artistic tastes and bertram resembles her it was his father the colonel who forced him into the army and i m somewhat astonished that he has done so well they were all soldiers i understand but wasn t there some scandal about a cousin richard blake said mrs keith making room for millicent graham her companion who rejoined them it s getting an old story and i always found it puzzling so far as one could judge dick blake should have made an excellent officer his mother the colonel s sister was true to the challoner strain his father a reckless irish sportsman but what was the story i haven t heard it after blake broke his neck when hunting the colonel brought dick up and as a matter of course sent him into the army he became a sapper and entering the indian service met his cousin bertram who was in the line somewhere on the frontier they were both sent with an expedition into the hills and there was a night attack it was important that an advanced post should be defended and dick had laid out the trenches in the middle of the fight an officer lost his nerve the position was stormed and the expedition terribly cut up owing to the darkness and confusion there was a doubt about who had led the retreat but dick was blamed and made no defence in spite of this he was acquitted at the inquiry perhaps because he was a favourite and colonel challoner was well known upon the

when walt irvine went down to inspect the intruder he was snarled at for his pains and madge likewise was snarled at when she went down to present as a peace offering a large pan of bread and milk a most unsociable dog he proved to be resenting all their advances refusing to let them lay hands on him menacing them with bared fangs and bristling hair nevertheless he remained sleeping and resting by the spring and eating the food they gave him after they set it down at a safe distance and retreated his wretched physical condition explained why he lingered and when he had recuperated after several days sojourn he disappeared and this would have been the end of him so far as irvine and his wife were concerned had not irvine at that particular time been called away into the northern part of the state biding along on the train near to the line between california and oregon he chanced to look out of the window and saw his unsociable guest sliding along the wagon road brown and wolfish tired yet tireless dust covered and soiled with two hundred miles of travel now irvine was a man of impulse a poet he got off the train at the next station bought a piece of meat at a butcher shop and captured the vagrant on the outskirts of the town the return trip was made in the baggage car and so wolf came a second time to the mountain cottage here he was tied up for a week and made love to by the man and woman but it was very circumspect love making remote and alien as a traveller from another planet he snarled down their soft spoken love words he never barked in all the time they had him he was never known to bark to win him became a problem irvine liked problems he had a metal plate made on which was stamped return to walt irvine glen ellen sonoma county california this was riveted to a collar and strapped about the dog s neck then he was turned loose and promptly he disappeared a day later came a telegram from mendocino county in twenty hours he had made over a hundred miles to the north and was still going when captured he came back by wells fargo express was tied up three days and was loosed on the fourth and lost this time he gained southern oregon before he was caught and returned always as soon as he received his liberty he fled away and always he fled north he was possessed of an obsession that drove him north the homing instinct irvine called it after he had expended the selling price of a sonnet in getting the animal back from northern oregon another time the brown wanderer succeeded in traversing half the length of california all of oregon and most of washington before he was picked up and returned collect a remarkable thing was the speed with which he traveled fed up and rested as soon as he was loosed he devoted all his energy to getting over the ground on the first day s run he was known to cover as high as a hundred and fifty miles and after that he would average a hundred miles a day until caught he always arrived back lean and hungry and savage and always departed fresh and vigorous cleaving his way northward in response to some prompting of his being that no one could understand but at last after a futile year of flight he accepted the inevitable and elected to remain at the cottage where first he had killed the rabbit and slept by the spring even after that a long time elapsed before the man and woman succeeded in patting him it was a great victory for they alone were allowed to put hands on him he was fastidiously exclusive and no guest at the cottage ever succeeded in making up to him a low growl greeted such approach if any one had the hardihood to come nearer the lips lifted the naked fangs appeared and the growl became a snarl a snarl so terrible and malignant that it awed the stoutest of them as it likewise awed the farmers dogs that knew ordinary dog snarling but had never seen wolf snarling before he was without antecedents his history began with walt and madge he had come up from the south but never a clew

that they would never quite heal again besides he looked like the photographs of the alaskan dogs they saw published in magazines and newspapers they often speculated over his past and tried to conjure up from what they had read and heard what his northland life had been that the northland still drew him they knew for at night they sometimes heard him crying softly and when the north wind blew and the bite of frost was in the air a great restlessness would come upon him and he would lift a mournful lament which they knew to be the long wolf howl yet he never barked no provocation was great enough to draw from him that canine cry long discussion they had during the time of winning him as to whose dog he was each claimed him and each proclaimed loudly any expression of affection made by him but the man had the better of it at first chiefly because he was a man it was patent that wolf had had no experience with women he did not understand women madge s skirts were something,3

arrangement made the night before and being reminded by her daughter questioned whether any good could come of attempts to peer into the future mr dowson was still more emphatic but his objections being recognized by both ladies as trouser pocket ones carried no weight it ended in flora going off with half a crown in her glove and an urgent request from her father to make it as difficult as possible for the sibyl by giving a false name and address no name was asked for however as miss dowson was shown into the untidy little back room on the first floor in which the sorceress ate slept

comparison with other men around him he was sincere as he was also self denying which if the two virtues be well examined will indicate the same phase of character but of all modern writers mr froude has been the hardest to cicero his sketch of the life of c sar is one prolonged censure on that of cicero our historian with all that glory of language for which he is so remarkable has covered the poor orator with obloquy there is no period in cicero s life so touching i think as that during which he was hesitating whether in the service of the republic it did or did not behoove him to join pompey before the battle of pharsalia at this time he wrote to his friend atticus various letters full of agonizing doubts as to what was demanded from him by his duty to his country by his friendship for pompey by loyalty to his party and by his own dignity as to a passage in one of those mr froude says that cicero had lately spoken of c sar s continuance in life as a disgrace to the state it has been seen also that he had long thought of assassination as the readiest means of ending it says mr froude the it has been seen refers to a statement made a few pages earlier in which he translates certain words written by cicero to atticus he considered it a disgrace to them that c sar was alive that is his translation and in his indignation he puts other words as it were into the mouth of his literary brother of two thousand years before why did not somebody kill him the latin words themselves are added in a note cum vivere ipsum turpe sit nobis hot indignation has so carried the translator away that he has missed the very sense of cicero s language when even to draw the breath of life at such a time is a disgrace to us that is what cicero meant mr froude in a preceding passage gives us another passage from a letter to atticus c sar was mortal so much is an intended translation then mr froude tells us how cicero had hailed c sar s eventual murder with rapture and goes on to say we read the words with sorrow and yet with pity but cicero had never dreamed of c sar s murder the words of the passage are as follows hunc primum mortalem esse deinde etiam multis modis extingui posse cogitabam i bethought myself in the first place that this man was mortal and then that there were a hundred ways in which he might be put on one side all the latter authorities have i believe supposed the hunc or this man to be pompey i should say that this was proved by the gist of the whole letter one of the most interesting that was ever written as telling the workings of a great man s mind at a peculiar crisis of his life did i not know that former learned editors have supposed c sar to have been meant but whether c sar or pompey there is nothing in it to do with murder it is a question cicero is saying to his friend of the stability of the republic when a matter so great is considered how is a man to trouble himself as to an individual who may die any day or cease from any accident to be of weight cicero was speaking of the effect of this or that step on his own part am i he says for the sake of pompey to bring down hordes of barbarians on my own country sacrificing the republic for the sake of a friend who is here to day and may be gone to morrow or for the sake of an enemy if the reader thinks that the hunc refers to c sar the argument is the same am i to consider an individual when the republic is at stake mr froude tells us that he reads the words with sorrow and yet with pity so would every one i think sympathizing with the patriot s doubts as to his leader as to his party and as to his country mr froude does so because he gathers from them that cicero is premeditating the murder of c sar it is natural that a man should be judged out of his own mouth a man who speaks much and so speaks that his words shall be listened to and read will be so judged but it is not too much to demand that when a man s character is at stake his own words shall be thoroughly sifted before they are used against him the writer of the biographical notice in the encyclopedia britannica on cicero sends down to posterity a statement that in the time of the first triumvirate when our hero was withstanding the machinations of c sar and pompey against the liberties of rome he was open to be bought the augurship would have bought him so pitiful says the biographer was the bribe to which he would have sacrificed his honor his opinions and the commonwealth with no more sententious language was the character of a great man ever offered up to public scorn and on what evidence we should have known nothing of the bribe and the corruption but for a few playful words in a letter from cicero himself to atticus he is writing from one of his villas to his friend in rome and asks for the news of the day who are to be the new consuls who is to have the vacant augurship ah says he they might have caught even me with that bait as he said on another occasion that he was so much in debt as to be fit for a rebel and again as i shall have to explain just now that he was like to be called in question under the cincian law because of a present of books this was just at the point of his life when he was declining all offers of public service of public service for which his soul longed because they were made to him by c sar it was then that the vigintiviratus was refused which quintilian mentions to his honor it was then that he refused to be c sar s lieutenant it was then that he might have been fourth with c sar and pompey and crassus had he not felt himself bound not to serve against the republic and yet the biographer does not hesitate to loa,3

jeeves at any rate for the last five years he has been living at this place of his down in lincolnshire as confirmed a species shunning hermit as ever put fresh water in the tank every second day and refused to see a soul that s why i was so amazed when you told me he had suddenly risen to the surface like this i still can t believe it i am inclined to think that there must be some mistake and that this bird who has been calling here is some different variety of fink nottle the chap i know wears horn rimmed spectacles and has a face like a fish how does that check up with your data the gentleman who came to the flat wore horn rimmed spectacles sir and looked like something on a slab possibly there was a certain suggestion of the piscine sir then it must be gussie i suppose but what on earth can have brought him up to london i am in a position to explain that sir mr fink nottle confided to me his motive in visiting the metropolis he came because the young lady is here young lady yes sir you don t mean he s in love yes sir well i m dashed i m really dashed i positively am dashed jeeves and i was too i mean to say a joke s a joke but there are limits then i found my mind turning to another aspect of this rummy affair conceding the fact that gussie fink nottle against all the ruling of the form book might have fallen in love why should he have been haunting my flat like this no doubt the occasion was one of those when a fellow needs a friend but i couldn t see what had made him pick on me it wasn t as if he and i were in any way bosom we had seen a lot of each other at one time of course but in the last two years i hadn t had so much as a post card from him i put all this to jeeves odd his coming to me still if he did he did no argument about that it must have been a nasty jar for the poor perisher when he found i wasn t here no sir mr fink nottle did not call to see you sir pull yourself together jeeves you ve just told me that this is what he has been doing and assiduously at that it was i with whom he was desirous of establishing communication sir you but i didn t know you had ever met him i had not had that pleasure until he called here sir but it appears that mr sipperley a fellow student of whom mr fink nottle had been at the university recommended him to place his affairs in my hands the mystery had conked i saw all as i dare say you

big consulting practices like jeeves s grow old sippy i knew had been deeply impressed by the man s efforts on his behalf at the time when he was trying to get engaged to elizabeth moon so it was not to be wondered at that he should have advised gussie to apply pure routine you might say oh you re acting for him are you yes sir now i follow now i understand and what is gussie s trouble oddly enough sir precisely the same as that of mr sipperley when i was enabled to be of assistance to him no doubt you recall mr sipperley s predicament sir deeply attached to miss moon he suffered from a rooted diffidence which made it impossible for him to speak i nodded i remember yes i recall the sipperley case he couldn t bring himself to the scratch a marked coldness of the feet was there not i recollect you saying he was letting what was it letting something do something cats entered into it if i am not mistaken letting i dare not wait upon i would sir that s right but how about the cats

courage fails him and yet if he wants this female to be his wife he s got to say so what i mean only civil to mention it precisely sir i mused well i suppose this was inevitable jeeves i wouldn t have thought that this fink nottle would ever have fallen a victim to the divine p but if he has no wonder he finds the going sticky yes sir look at the life he s led yes sir i don t suppose he has spoken to a girl for years what a lesson this is to us jeeves not to shut ourselves up in country houses and stare into glass tanks you can t be the dominant male if you do that sort of thing in this life you can choose between two courses you can either shut yourself up in a country house and stare into tanks or you can be a dasher with the sex you can t do both no sir i mused once more gussie and i

human splendor unfolding through the earth s changing periods floods and fire and convulsions and ice arrest intervene between the great glamorous civilizations of mankind but nothing will ever quench humanity and the human potentiality to evolve something magnificent out of a renewed chaos i do not believe in evolution but in the strangeness and rainbow change of ever renewed creative

sages it is not for me to arrange fossils and decipher hieroglyphic phrases i couldn t do it if i wanted to but then i can do something else the soul must take the hint from the relics our scientists have so marvelously gathered out of the forgotten past and from the hint develop a new living utterance the spark is from dead wisdom but the fire is life and as an example a very simple one of how a scientist of the most innocent modern sort may hint at truths which when stated he would laugh at as fantastic nonsense let us quote a word from the already old fashioned golden bough it must have appeared to the ancient aryan that the sun was periodically recruited from the fire which resided in the sacred oak exactly the fire which resided in the tree of life that is life itself so we must read it must have appeared to the ancient aryan that the sun was periodically recruited from life which is what the early greek philosophers were always saying and which still seems to me the real truth the clue to the cosmos instead of life being drawn from the sun it is the emanation from life itself that is from all the living plants and creatures which nourish the sun of course my dear critic the ancient aryans were just doddering the old duffers or babbling the babes but as for me i have some respect for my ancestors and believe they had more up their sleeve than just the marvel of the unborn me one last weary little word this pseudo philosophy of mine pollyanalytics as one of my respected critics might say is deduced from the novels and poems not the reverse the novels and poems come unwatched out of one s pen and then the absolute need which one has for some sort of satisfactory mental attitude towards oneself and things in general makes one try to abstract some definite conclusions from one s experiences as a writer and as a man the novels and poems are pure passionate experience these pollyanalytics are inferences made afterwards from the experience and finally it seems to me that even art is utterly dependent on philosophy or if you prefer it on a metaphysic the metaphysic or philosophy may not be anywhere very accurately stated and may be quite unconscious in the artist yet it is a metaphysic that governs men at the time and is by all men more or less comprehended and lived men live and see according to some gradually developing and gradually withering vision this vision exists also as a dynamic idea or metaphysic exists first as such then it is unfolded into life and art our vision our belief our metaphysic is wearing woefully thin and the art is wearing absolutely threadbare we have no future neither for our hopes nor our aims nor our art it has all gone gray and opaque we ve got to rip the old veil of a vision across and find what the heart really believes in after all and what the heart really wants for the next future and we ve got to put it down in terms of belief and of knowledge and then go forward again to the fulfillment in life and art rip the veil of the old vision across and walk through the rent and if i try to do this well why not if i try to write down what i see why not if a publisher likes to print the book all right and if anybody wants to read it let him but why anybody should read one single word if he doesn t want to i don t see unless of course he is a critic who needs to scribble a dollar

once have been a plateau of red rock from which the softer strata had eroded leaving the gentle league long slopes marked here and there by upstanding pillars and columns of singular shape and beauty

woven itself into my mind and the spot where i stood was to be the place where lin slone taught lucy bostil to ride the great stallion wildfire illustration there was something beyond the white peaked

named it deception pass the segi had innumerable branches all more or less the same size and sometimes it was difficult to tell the main canyon from one of its tributaries the walls were rugged and crumbling of a red or yellow hue upward of a thousand feet in height and indented by spruce sided notches there were a number of ruined cliff dwellings the most accessible of which was keet seel i could imagine no more picturesque spot a huge wind worn cavern with a vast slanted stained wall held upon a projecting ledge or shelf the long line of cliff dwellings these silent little stone houses with their vacant black eye like windows had strange power to make me ponder and then dream next day upon resuming our journey it pleased me to try to find the trail to betatakin the most noted and surely the most wonderful and beautiful ruin in all the west in many places there was no trail at all and i encountered difficulties but in the end without much loss of time i entered the narrow rugged entrance of the canyon i had named surprise valley sight of the great dark cave thrilled me as i thought it might have thrilled bess and venters who had lived for me their imagined lives of loneliness here in this wild spot with the sight of those lofty walls and the scent of the dry sweet sage there rushed over me a strange feeling that riders of the purple sage was true my dream people of romance had really lived there once upon a time i climbed high upon the huge stones and along the smooth red walls where pay larkin once had glided with swift sure steps and i entered the musty cliff dwellings and called out to hear the weird and sonorous echoes and i wandered through the thickets and upon the grassy spruce shaded benches never for a moment free of the story i had conceived there something of awe and sadness abided with me i could not enter into the merry pranks and investigations of my party surprise valley seemed a part of my past my dreams my very self i left it haunted by its loneliness and silence and beauty by the story it had given me that night we camped at bubbling spring which once had been a geyser of considerable power wetherill told a story of an old navajo who had lived there for a long time according to the indian tale the old chief resided there without complaining of this geyser that was wont to inundate his fields but one season the unreliable waterspout made great and persistent endeavor to drown him and his people and horses whereupon the old navajo took his gun and shot repeatedly at the geyser and thundered aloud his anger to the great spirit the geyser ebbed away and from that day never burst forth again illustration weird and wonderful monuments in monument valley illustration sunset on the desert illustration cave of

significant and impressive about an indian when he points anywhere it is as if he says there way beyond over the ranges is a place i know and it is far the fact was that i looked at the piute s dark inscrutable face before i looked out into the void my gaze then seemed impelled and held by things afar a vast yellow and purple corrugated world of distance apparently now on a level with my eyes i was drawn by the beauty and grandeur of that scene and then i was transfixed almost by fear by the realization that i dared to venture down into this wild and upflung fastness i kept looking afar sweeping the three quarter circle of horizon till my judgment of distance was confounded and my sense of proportion dwarfed one moment and magnified the next wetherill was pointing and explaining but

humiliation jacob felt a little thrill of triumph at the thought of mr bultiwell s three gardeners it took more than gardeners to grow such a rose as he was wearing he liked to fancy that it took personal care personal sympathy personal love the sweetest and rarest flowers must have their special atmosphere quite suddenly mr edward bultiwell laid down his times and glared across at jacob he was a large man with an ugly red face a neck which hung over his collar in rolls and a resonant voice directly he began to speak jacob began to shiver pratt he said am i to understand that the greeting which you offered to the occupants of this carriage when you entered was intended to include me i i certainly meant it to was the tremulous reply then let me beg that such a liberty be not repeated mr bultiwell continued brutally i look upon a man who has compounded with his creditors as a person temporarily at any rate outside the pale of converse with his fellows on er equal terms i look upon your presence in a first class carriage wearing a floral adornment mr bultiwell added with a jealous glance at the very beautiful rose which is to say the least of it conspicuous as er an impertinence to those who have had the misfortune to suffer from your insolvency the healthy colour faded from jacob s cheeks he had the air of one stricken by a lash dazed for the moment and bewildered my rose cost me nothing he faltered and my season ticket doesn t expire till next month i must go up to the city my help is needed with the books mr bultiwell shook his paper preparatory to disappearing behind it your presence here may be considered a matter of taste he fired off as a parting shot i call it damned bad taste mr jacob pratt sat like a hurt thing till the train stopped at the next station then he stumbled out on to the platform and making his way through an unaccountable mist he climbed somehow or other into a third class carriage richard dauncey the melancholy man who lived in the cottage opposite to his looked up at the newcomer s entrance and for the first time within his recollection jacob saw him smile good morning mr pratt the former said with a strenuous attempt at cordiality if you ll excuse my saying so that s the finest rose i ve ever seen in my life richard dauncey made his fortune by that speech and jacob had to swallow very hard and look very fixedly out of the window chapter i precisely two years later jacob pratt sat once more in his cottage sitting room contemplating the remains of a barely tasted breakfast before him read for the fiftieth time were the wonderful letters in his brain a most amazing confusion in his heart an almost hysterical joy presently mrs harris brought in his hat and stick you ll excuse my mentioning it sir she said looking at the former a little disparagingly but brush though i may there s no doing much with this hat of yours the nap s fair gone maybe you haven t noticed it sir but with the summer coming on a straw hat i ll buy a straw hat to day mrs harris jacob promised and you ll be home at the usual time for your supper sir i i expect so i am not quite sure mrs harris i shall be home sometime during the day all right mrs harris shook her head at the sight of the untasted egg you ll excuse my saying so sir she pronounced severely but there s no good work done on an empty stomach times is hard as we all know but eggs is cheap mrs harris jacob reminded her it is two years since i left one of your eggs i left it then because i was miserable i am leaving it this morning because i have had good news i can t eat later on later on mrs harris and a bit of good news is what you deserve sir the latter declared lingering while he cut his accustomed rose with fingers which trembled strangely thank you very much mrs harris he said when i come back to night i ll tell you all about it once more then two years almost to a day after mr edward bultiwell of the great firm of bultiwell and sons had laid down his newspaper and spoken his mind jacob was on his way to the station again wearing a choice rose in his buttonhole he had found no occasion to change his lodgings for he had been an economical man who took great care of his possessions even in the days of his prosperity and his moderate salary as traveller for a bermondsey firm of merchants brought him in quite enough for his simple needs he had to some extent lived down his disgrace the manager of the international stores nodded to him now a trifle condescendingly yet with tacit acknowledgement of the fact that in domestic affairs jacob was a man of principle who always paid his way the greengrocer s wife passed the time of day when not too preoccupied and the newspaper boy no longer clutched for his penny jacob generally met the melancholy man at the corner of the avenue and walked to the station with him and he still grew roses and worshipped them on the way to the station on this particular morning he amazed his friend richard he said i shall not travel to the city with you to day at least i shall not start with you i shall change carriages at wendley as i did once before the devil richard exclaimed they were passing the plate glass window of a new emporium and jacob paused to glance furtively at his reflection he was an exceedingly neat man and his care for his clothes and person had survived two years of impecuniosity nevertheless although he passed muster well enough to the casual observer there were indications in his attire of the inevitable conflict between a desire for adornment and the lack of means to indulge it his too often pressed trousers were thin at the seams his linen thoug,4

called his dratted speerits customer said tom in a harsh voice sorry to disturb you at your prayers guv nor but not having two pair of hands i can t serve a crowd meaning the old woman of the undergarments and myself mr potts slid off his stool and prepared for action when he saw however who the customer was he bristled that is the only word for it the truth is that although between us there was an inward and spiritual sympathy there was also an outward and visible hostility twice i had outbid mr potts at a local auction for articles which he desired moreover after the fashion of every good collector he felt it to be his duty to hate me as another collector lastly several times i had offered him smaller sums for antiques upon which he set a certain monetary value it is true that long ago i had given up this bargaining for the reason that mr potts would never take less than he asked indeed he followed the example of the vendor of the sibylline books in ancient rome he did not destroy the goods indeed after the fashion of that person and demand the price of all of them for the one that remained but invariably he put up his figure by per cent and nothing would induce him to take off one farthing what do you want sir he said grumpily vests hose collars or socks oh socks i think i replied at hazard thinking that they would be easiest to carry whereupon mr potts produced some peculiarly objectionable and shapeless woollen articles which he almost threw at me saying that they were all he had in stock now i detest woollen socks and never wear them still i made a purchase thinking with sympathy of my old gardener whose feet they would soon be scratching and while the parcel was being tied up said in an insinuating voice anything fresh upstairs mr potts no sir he answered shortly at least not much and if there were what s the use of showing them to you after the business about that clock it was you wanted for it mr potts i asked no sir it was and now it s per cent on to that you can work out the sum for yourself well let s have another look at it mr potts i replied humbly whereon with a grunt and a muttered injunction to tom to mind the shop he led the way upstairs now the house in which mr potts dwelt had once been of considerable pretensions and was very very old elizabethan i should think although it had been refronted with a horrible stucco to suit modern tastes the oak staircase was good though narrow and led to numerous small rooms upon two floors above some of which rooms were panelled and had oak beams now whitewashed like the panelling at least they had once been whitewashed probably in the last generation these rooms were literally crammed with every sort of old furniture most of it decrepit though for many of the articles dealers would have given a good price but at dealers mr potts drew the line not one of them had ever set a foot upon that oaken stair to the attics the place was filled with this furniture and other articles such as books china samplers with the glass broken and i know not what besides piled in heaps upon the floor indeed where mr potts slept was a mystery either it must have been under the counter in his shop or perhaps at nights he inhabited a worm eaten jacobean bedstead which stood in an attic for i observed a kind of pathway to it running through a number of legless chairs also some dirty blankets between the moth riddled curtains not far from this bedstead propped in an intoxicated way against the sloping wall of the old house stood the clock which i desired it was one of the first regulator clocks with a wooden pendulum used by the maker himself to check the time keeping of all his other clocks and enclosed in a chaste and perfect mahogany case of the very best style of its period so beautiful was it indeed that it had been an instance of love at first sight between us and although there was an estrangement on the matter of settlements or in other words over the question of price now i felt that never more could that clock and i be parted so i agreed to give old potts the or to be accurate s which he asked on the per cent rise principle thankful in my heart that he had not made it more and prepared to go as i turned however my eye fell upon a large chest of the almost indestructible yellow cypress wood of which were made it is said the doors of st peter s at rome that stood for eight hundred years and for aught i know are still standing as good as on the day when they were put up marriage coffer said potts answering my unspoken question italian about i suggested

sense enough to see that ideas exist and eugenics itself in large quantities or small coming quickly or coming slowly urged from good motives or bad applied to a thousand people or applied to three eugenics itself is a thing no more to be bargained about than poisoning it is not really difficult to sum up the essence of eugenics though some of the eugenists seem to be rather vague about it the movement consists of two parts a moral basis which is common to all and a scheme of social application which varies a good deal for the moral basis it is obvious that man s ethical responsibility varies with his knowledge of consequences if i were in charge of a baby like dr johnson in that tower of vision and if the baby was ill through having eaten the soap i might possibly send for a doctor i might be calling him away from much more serious cases from the bedsides of babies whose diet had been far more deadly but i should be justified i could not be expected to know enough about his other patients to be obliged or even entitled to sacrifice to them the baby for whom i was primarily and directly responsible now the eugenic moral basis is this that the baby for whom we are primarily and directly responsible is the babe unborn that is that we know or may come to know enough of certain inevitable tendencies in biology to consider the fruit of some contemplated union in that direct and clear light of conscience which we can now only fix on the other partner in that union the one duty can conceivably be as definite as or more definite than the other the baby that does not exist can be considered even before the wife who does now it is essential to grasp that this is a comparatively new note in morality of course sane people always thought the aim of marriage was the procreation of children to the glory of god or according to the plan of nature but whether they counted such children as god s reward for service or nature s premium on sanity they always left the reward to god or the premium to nature as a less definable thing the only person and this is the point towards whom one could have precise duties was the partner in the process directly considering the partner s claims was the nearest one could get to indirectly considering the claims of posterity if the women of the harem sang praises of the hero as the moslem mounted his horse it was because this was the due of a man if the christian knight helped his wife off her horse it was because this was the due of a woman definite and detailed dues of this kind they did not predicate of the babe unborn regarding him in that agnostic and opportunist light in which mr browdie regarded the hypothetical child of miss squeers thinking these sex relations healthy they naturally hoped they would produce healthy children but that was all the moslem woman doubtless expected allah to send beautiful sons to an obedient wife but she would not have allowed any direct vision of such sons to alter the obedience itself she would not have said i will now be a disobedient wife as the learned leech informs me that great prophets are often the children of disobedient wives the knight doubtless hoped that the saints would help him to strong children if he did all the duties of his station one of which might be helping his wife off her horse but he would not have refrained from doing this because he had read in a book that a course of falling off horses often resulted in the birth of a genius both moslem and christian would have thought such speculations not only impious but utterly unpractical i quite agree with them but that is not the point here the point here is that a new school believes eugenics against ethics and it is proved by one familiar fact that the heroisms of history are actually the crimes of eugenics the eugenists books and articles are full of suggestions that non eugenic unions should and may come to be regarded as we regard sins that we should really feel that marrying an invalid is a kind of cruelty to children but history is full of the praises of people who have held sacred such ties to invalids of cases like those of colonel hutchinson and sir william temple who remained faithful to betrothals when beauty and health had been apparently blasted and though the illnesses of dorothy osborne and mrs hutchinson may not fall under the eugenic speculations i do not know it is obvious that they might have done so and certainly it would not have made any difference to men s moral opinion of the act i do not discuss here which morality i favour but i insist that they are opposite the eugenist really sets up as saints the very men whom hundreds of families have called sneaks to be consistent they ought to put up statues to the men who deserted their loves because of bodily misfortune with inscriptions celebrating the good eugenist who on his fianc e falling off a bicycle nobly refused to marry her or to the young hero who on hearing of an uncle with erysipelas magnanimously broke his word what is perfectly plain is this that mankind have hitherto held the bond between man and woman so sacred and the effect of it on the children so incalculable that they have always admired the maintenance of honour more than the maintenance of safety doubtless they thought that even the children might be none the worse for not being the children of cowards and shirkers but this was not the first thought the first commandment briefly we may say that while many moral systems have set restraints on sex almost as severe as any eugenist could set they have almost always had the character of securing the fidelity of the two sexes to each other and leaving the rest to god to introduce an ethic which makes that fidelity or infidelity vary with some calculation about heredity is that rarest of all t,4

the cathedral of worcester during the years he had served as master of fence at the english court the sons of royalty had learned to thrust and parry and cut as only de vac could teach the art and he had been as conscientious in the discharge of his duties as he had been in his unswerving hatred and contempt for his pupils and now the english king had put upon him such an insult as might only be wiped out by blood as the blow fell the wiry frenchman clicked his heels together and throwing down his foil he stood erect and rigid as a marble statue before his master white and livid was his tense drawn face but he spoke no word he might have struck the king but then there would have been left to him no alternative save death by his own hand for a king may not fight with a lesser mortal and he who strikes a king may not live the king s honor must be satisfied had a french king struck him de vac would have struck back and gloried in the fate which permitted him to die for the honor of france but an english king pooh a dog and who would die for a dog no de vac would find other means of satisfying his wounded pride he would revel in revenge against this man for whom he felt no loyalty if possible he would harm the whole of england if he could but he would bide his time he could afford to wait for his opportunity if by waiting he could encompass a more terrible revenge de vac had been

his many attributes his wonderful swordsmanship and his fearful hatred for his adopted country chapter ii south of the armory of westminster palace lay the gardens and here on the third day following the king s affront to de vac might have been a seen a black haired woman gowned in a violet cyclas richly embroidered with gold about the yoke and at the bottom of the loose pointed sleeves which reached almost to the similar bordering on the lower hem of the garment a richly wrought leathern girdle studded with precious stones and held in place by a huge carved buckle of gold clasped the garment about her waist so that the upper portion fell outward over the girdle after the manner of a blouse in the girdle was a long dagger of beautiful workmanship dainty sandals encased her feet while a wimple of violet silk bordered in gold fringe lay becomingly over her head and shoulders by her side walked a handsome boy of about three clad like his companion in gay colors his tiny surcoat of scarlet velvet was rich with embroidery while beneath was a close fitting tunic of white silk his doublet was of scarlet while his long hose of white were cross gartered with scarlet from his tiny sandals to his knees on the back of his brown curls sat a flat brimmed round crowned hat in which a single plume of white waved and nodded bravely at each move of the proud little head the child s features were well molded and his frank bright eyes gave an expression of boyish generosity to a face which otherwise would have been too arrogant and haughty for such a mere baby as he talked with his companion little flashes of peremptory authority and dignity which sat strangely upon one so tiny caused the young woman at times to turn her head from him that he might not see the smiles which she could scarce repress presently the boy took a ball from his tunic and pointing at a little bush near them said stand you there lady maud by yonder bush i would play at toss the young woman did as she was bid and when she had taken her place and turned to face him the boy threw the ball to her thus they played beneath the windows of the armory the boy running blithely after the ball when he missed it and laughing and shouting in happy glee when he made a particularly good catch in one of the windows of the armory overlooking the garden stood a grim gray old man leaning upon his folded arms his brows drawn together in a malignant scowl the corners of his mouth set in a stern cold line he looked upon the garden and the playing child and upon the lovely young woman beneath him but with eyes which did not see for de vac was working out a great problem the greatest of all his life for three days the old man had brooded over his grievance seeking for some means to be revenged upon the king for the insult which henry had put upon him many schemes had presented themselves to his shrewd and cunning mind but so far all had been rejected as unworthy of the terrible satisfaction which his wounded pride demanded his fancies had for the most part revolved about the unsettled political conditions of henry s reign for from these he felt he might wrest that opportunity which could be turned to his own personal uses and to the harm and possibly the undoing of the king for years an inmate of the palace and often a listener in the armory when the king played at sword with his friends and favorites de vac had heard much which passed between henry iii and his intimates that could well be turned to the king s harm by a shrewd and resourceful enemy with all england he knew the utter contempt in which henry held the terms of the magna charta which he so often violated along with his kingly oath to maintain it but what all england did not know de vac had gleaned from scraps

wearily looks another way still each with the utmost apathy incognizant unaware nothing as for papa he snaps when i offer him his offspring just as he snaps when i poke a bit of stick at him because he is irascible this morning an irascible tortoise being touched with love and devoid of fatherliness father and mother and three little brothers and all rambling aimless like little perambulating pebbles scattered in the garden not knowing each other from bits of earth or old tins except that papa and mama are old acquaintances of course but family feeling there is none not even the beginnings fatherless motherless brotherless sisterless little tortoise row on then small pebble over the clods of the autumn wind chilled sunshine young gayety does he look for a companion no no don t think it he doesn t know he is alone isolation is his birthright this atom to row forward and reach himself tall on spiny toes to travel to burrow into a little loose earth afraid of the night to crop a little substance to move and to be quite sure that he is moving basta to be a tortoise think of it in a garden of inert clods a brisk brindled little tortoise all to himself croesus in a garden of pebbles and insects to roam and feel the slow heart beat tortoise wise the first bell sounding from the warm blood in the dark creation morning moving and being himself slow and unquestioned and inordinately

and matronly and rather dirty a little sardonic looking as if domesticity had driven her to it though what she does except lay four eggs at random in the garden once a year and put up with her husband i don t know she likes to eat she hurries up striding reared on long uncanny legs when food is going oh yes she can make haste when she likes she snaps the soft bread from my hand in great mouthfuls opening her rather pretty wedge of an iron pristine face into an enormously wide beaked mouth like sudden curved scissors and gulping at more than she can swallow and working her thick soft tongue and having the bread hanging over her chin o mistress mistress reptile mistress your eye is very dark very bright and it never softens although you watch she knows she knows well enough to come for food yet she sees me not her bright eye sees but not me not anything sightful sightless seeing and visionless reptile mistress taking bread in her curved gaping toothless mouth she has no qualm when she catches my finger in her steel overlapping gums but she hangs on and my shout and my shrinking are nothing to her she does not even know she is nipping me with her curved beak snake like she draws at my finger while i drag it in horror away mistress reptile mistress you are almost too large i am almost frightened he is much smaller dapper beside her and ridiculously small her laconic eye has an earthy materialistic look his poor darling is almost fiery his wimple his blunt prowed face his low forehead his skinny neck his long scaled striving legs so striving striving are all more delicate than she and he has a cruel scar on his shell poor darling biting at her feet running beside her like a dog biting her earthy splay feet nipping her ankles which she drags apathetic away though without retreating into her shell agelessly silent and with a grim reptile determination cold voiceless age after age behind him serpents long obstinacy of horizontal persistence little old man scuffling beside her bending down catching his opportunity parting his steel trap face so suddenly and seizing her scaly ankle and hanging grimly on letting go at last as she drags away and closing his steel trap face his steel trap stoic ageless handsome face alas what a fool he looks in this scuffle and how he feels it the lonely rambler the stoic dignified stalker through chaos the immune the animate enveloped in isolation forerunner now look at him alas the spear is through the side of his isolation his adolescence saw him crucified into sex doomed in the long crucifixion of desire to seek his consummation beyond himself divided into passionate duality,4

all sorts of people lie awake thinking of it i wish some of my damned committee would the doctor turned his eyes to the window i lie awake too he said and seemed to reflect but he was observing his patient acutely with his ears but you see how important it is said sir richmond and left his sentence unfinished i ll do what i can for you said the doctor and considered swiftly what line of talk he had best follow section this sense of a coming smash is epidemic said the doctor it s at the back of all sorts of mental trouble it is a new state of mind before the war it was abnormal a phase of neurasthenia now it is almost the normal state with whole classes of intelligent people intelligent i say the others always have been casual and adventurous and always will be a loss of confidence in the general background of life so that we seem to float over abysses we do said sir richmond and we have nothing but the old habits and ideas acquired in the days of our assurance there is a discord a jarring the doctor pursued his train of thought a new raw and dreadful sense of responsibility for the universe accompanied by a realization that the job is overwhelmingly too big for us we ve got to stand up to the job said sir richmond anyhow what else is there to do we may keep things together i ve got to do my bit and if only i could hold myself at it i could beat those fellows but that s where the devil of it comes in never have i been so desirous to work well in my life and never have i been so slack and weak willed and inaccurate sloppy indolent vicious the doctor was about to speak but sir richmond interrupted him what s got hold of me what s got hold of me i used to work well enough it s as if my will had come untwisted and was ravelling out into separate strands i ve lost my unity i m not a man but a mob i ve got to recover my vigour at any cost again as the doctor was about to speak the word was taken out of his mouth and what i think of it dr martineau is this it s fatigue it s mental and moral fatigue too much effort on too high a level and too austere one strains and fags flags flags i meant to say one strains and flags and then the lower stuff in one the subconscious stuff takes control there was a flavour of popularized psychoanalysis about this and the doctor drew in the corners of his mouth and gave his head a critical slant m m but this only made sir richmond raise his voice and quicken his speech i want he said a good tonic a pick me up a stimulating harmless drug of some sort that s indicated anyhow to begin with something to pull me together as people say bring me up to the scratch again i don t like the use of drugs said the doctor the expectation of sir richmond s expression changed to disappointment but that s not reasonable he cried that s not reasonable that s superstition call a thing a drug and condemn it everything is a drug everything that affects you food stimulates or tranquillizes drink noise is a stimulant and quiet an opiate what is life but response to stimulants or reaction after them when i m exhausted i want food when i m overactive and sleepless i want tranquillizing when i m dispersed i want pulling together but we don t know how to use drugs the doctor objected but you ought to know dr martineau fixed his eye on a first floor window sill on the opposite side of harley street his manner suggested a lecturer holding on to his theme a day will come when we shall be able to manipulate drugs all sorts of drugs and work them in to our general way of living i have no prejudice against them at all a time will come when we shall correct our moods get down to our reserves of energy by their help suspend fatigue put off sleep during long spells of exertion at some sudden crisis for example when we shall know enough to know just how far to go with this that or the other stuff and how to wash out its after effects i quite agree with you in principle but that time hasn t come yet decades of research yet if we tried that sort of thing now we should be like children playing with poisons and explosives it s out of the question i ve been taking a few little things already easton syrup for example strychnine it carries you for a time and drops you by the way has it done you any good any nett good it has i can see broken your sleep the doctor turned round again to his patient and looked up into his troubled face given physiological trouble i don t mind resorting to a drug given structural injury i don t mind surgery but except for any little mischief your amateur drugging may have done you do not seem to me to be either sick or injured you ve no trouble either of structure or material you are worried ill in your mind and otherwise perfectly sound it s the current of your

153,1934,tender is the night,they were still in the happier stage of love they were full of brave illusions about each other tremendous illusions so that the communion of self with self seemed to be on a plane where no other human relations mattered they both seemed to have arrived there with an extraordinary innocence as though a series of pure accidents had driven them together so many accidents that at last they were forced to conclude that they were for each other they had arrived with clean hands or so it seemed after no traffic with the merely curious and clandestine,4

grasp in that moment of pure observation on which we pride ourselves is not alien to the principle of classification but deeper we could if we liked make excellent comment upon the nature of provincial spaniards or of destitution as misery is called by the philanthropists or on homes for working girls but such is not our intention we aim at experience in the particular centres in which alone it is evil we avoid classification we do not deny it but when a man is classified something is lost the majority of mankind live on paper currency they use terms which are merely good for so much reality they never see actual coinage i should go even further than that said eeldrop the majority not only have no language to express anything save generalized man they are for the most part unaware of themselves as anything but generalized men they are first of all government officials or pillars of the church or trade unionists or poets or unemployed this cataloguing is not only satisfactory to other people for practical purposes it is sufficient to themselves for their life of the spirit many are not quite real at any moment when wolstrip married i am sure he said to himself now i am consummating the union of two of the best families in philadelphia the question is said appleplex what is to be our philosophy this must be settled at once mrs howexden recommends me to read bergson he writes very entertainingly on the structure of the eye of the frog not at all interrupted his friend our philosophy is quite irrelevant the essential is that our philosophy should spring from our point of view and not return upon itself to explain our point of view a philosophy about intuition is somewhat less likely to be intuitive than any other we must avoid having a platform but at least said appleplex we are individualists no nor anti intellectualists these also are labels the individualist is a member of a mob as fully as any other man and the mob of individualists is the most unpleasing because it has the least character nietzsche was a mob man just as bergson is an intellectualist we cannot escape the label but let it be one which carries no distinction and arouses no self consciousness sufficient that we should find simple labels and not further exploit them i am i confess to you in private life a bank clerk and should according to your own view have a wife three children and a vegetable garden in a suburb said appleplex such is precisely the case returned eeldrop but i had not thought it necessary to mention this biographical detail as it is saturday

small houses to left and right were rank with ivy and tall grass and lilac bushes the tropical south london verdure was dusty above and mouldy below the tepid air swarmed with flies eeldrop at the

society he removed the file marked london from between the files barcelona and boston where it had been misplaced and turned over the papers rapidly the lady you mention he rejoined at last whom i

letter from her mother in honolulu on ruled paper a poem written on a restaurant bill to atthis and a letter by herself on lady equistep s best notepaper containing some damaging but entertaining information about lady equistep then there are my own few observations on two sheets of foolscap edith murmured eeldrop who had not been attending to this catalogue i wonder what has become of her not pleasure but fulness of life to burn ever with a hard gem like flame those were her words what curiosity and passion for experience perhaps that flame has burnt itself out by now you ought to inform yourself better said appleplex severely edith dines sometimes with mrs howexden who tells me that her passion for experience has taken her to a russian pianist in bayswater she is also said to be present often at the anarchist tea rooms and can usually be found in the evening at the cafe de l orangerie well replied eeldrop i confess that i prefer to wonder what has become of her i do not like to think of her future scheherazade grown old i see her grown very plump full bosomed with blond hair living in a small flat with a maid walking in the park with a pekinese motoring with a jewish stock broker with a fierce appetite for food and drink when all other appetite is gone all other appetite gone except the insatiable increasing appetite of vanity rolling on two wide legs rolling in motorcars rolling toward a diabetic end in a seaside watering place just now you saw that bright flame burning itself out said appleplex now you see it guttering thickly which proves that your vision

now begin to hypnotize us again our own impulse towards our own scientific way of understanding being almost spent and so besides myths we find the same mathematic figures cosmic graphs which remain among the aboriginal peoples in all continents mystic figures and signs whose true cosmic or scientific significance is lost yet which continue in use for purposes of conjuring or divining if my reader finds this bosh and abracadabra all right for him only i have no more regard for his little crowings on his own little dunghill myself i am not so sure that i am one of the one and onlies i like the wide world of centuries and vast ages mammoth worlds beyond our day and mankind so wonderful in his distances his history that has no beginning yet always the pomp and the magnificence of human splendor unfolding through the earth s changing periods floods and fire and convulsions and ice arrest intervene between the great glamorous civilizations of mankind but nothing will ever quench humanity and the human potentiality to evolve something magnificent out of a renewed chaos i do not believe in evolution but in the strangeness and rainbow change of ever renewed creative civilizations so much then for my claim to remarkable discoveries i believe i am only trying to stammer out the first terms of a forgotten knowledge but i have no desire to revive dead kings or dead sages it is not for me to arrange fossils and decipher hieroglyphic phrases i couldn t do it if i wanted to but then i can do something else the soul must take the hint from the relics our scientists have so marvelously gathered out of the forgotten past and from the hint develop a new living utterance the spark is from dead wisdom but the fire is life and as an example a very simple one of how a scientist of the most innocent modern sort may hint at truths which when stated he would laugh at as fantastic nonsense let us quote a word from the already old fashioned golden bough it must have appeared to the ancient aryan that the sun was periodically recruited from the fire which resided in the sacred oak exactly the fire which resided in the tree of life that is life itself so we must read it must have appeared to the ancient aryan that the sun was periodically recruited from life which is what the early greek philosophers were always saying and which still seems to me the real truth the clue to the cosmos instead of life being drawn from the sun it is the emanation from life itself that is from all the living plants and creatures which nourish the sun of course my dear critic the ancient aryans were just doddering the old duffers or babbling the babes but as for me i have some respect for my ancestors and believe they had more up their sleeve than just the marvel of the unborn me one last weary little word this pseudo philosophy of mine pollyanalytics as one of my respected critics might say is deduced from the novels and poems not the reverse the novels and poems come unwatched out of one s pen and then the absolute need which one has for some sort of satisfactory mental attitude towards oneself and things in general makes one try to abstract some definite conclusions from one s experiences as a writer and as a man the novels and poems are pure passionate experience these pollyanalytics are inferences made afterwards from the experience and finally it seems to me that even art is utterly dependent on philosophy or if you prefer it on a metaphysic the metaphysic or philosophy may not be anywhere very accurately stated and may be quite unconscious in the artist yet it is a metaphysic that governs men at the time and is by all men more or less comprehended and lived men live and see according to some gradually developing and gradually withering vision this vision exists also as a dynamic idea or metaphysic exists first as such then it is unfolded into life and art our vision our belief our metaphysic is wearing woefully thin and the art is wearing absolutely threadbare we have no future neither for our hopes nor our aims nor our art it has all gone gray and opaque we ve got to rip the old veil of a vision across and find what the heart really believes in after all and what the heart really wants for the next future and we ve got to put it down in terms of belief and of knowledge and then go forward again to the fulfillment in life and art rip the veil of the old vision across and walk through the rent and if i try to do this well why not if i try to write down what i see why not if a publisher likes to print the book all right and if anybody wants to read it let him but why anybody should read one single word if he doesn t want to i don t see unless of course he is a critic who needs to scribble a dollar s worth of words no matter how taormina october fantasia of the unconscious chapter i introduction let us start by making a little apology to psychoanalysis it wasn t fair to jeer at the psychoanalytic unconscious or perhaps it was fair to jeer at the psychoanalytic unconscious which is truly a negative quantity and an unpleasant menagerie what was really not fair was to jeer at psychoanalysis as if freud had invented and described nothing but an unconscious in all his theory the unconscious is not of course the clue to the freudian theory the real clue is sex a sexual motive is to be attributed to all human activity now this is going too far we are bound to admit than an element of sex enters into all human activity but so does an element of greed and of many other things we are bound to admit that into all human relationships particularly adult human relationships a large element of sex enters we are thankful that freud has insisted on this we are t,4

having received a good many knocks at home he kept the hard head out of sight and played at poetry and romance with his literary wife and his sturdy passionate girls he was a man of courage not given to complaining bearing his burdens by himself no he did not let the world intrude far into his home he had a delicate sensitive wife whose poetry won some fame in the narrow world of letters he himself with his tough old barbarian fighting spirit had an almost child like delight in verse in sweet poetry and in the delightful game of a cultured home his blood was strong even to coarseness but that only made the home more vigorous more robust and christmassy there was always a touch of christmas about him now he was well off if there was poetry after dinner there were also chocolates and nuts and good little out of the way things to be munching well then into this family came egbert he was made of quite a different paste the girls and the father were strong limbed thick blooded people true english as holly trees and hawthorn are english their culture was grafted on to them as one might perhaps graft a common pink rose on to a thornstem it flowered oddly enough but it did not alter their blood and egbert was a born rose the age long breeding had left him with a delightful spontaneous passion he was not clever nor even literary no but the intonation of his voice and the movement of his supple handsome body and the fine texture of his flesh and his hair the slight arch of his nose the quickness of his blue eyes would easily take the place of poetry winifred loved him loved him this southerner as a higher being a higher being mind you not a deeper and as for him he loved her in passion with every fibre of him she was the very warm stuff of life to him wonderful then those days at crockham cottage the first days all alone save for the woman who came to work in the mornings marvellous days when she had all his tall supple fine fleshed youth to herself for herself and he had her like a ruddy fire into which he could cast himself for rejuvenation ah that it might never end this passion this marriage the flame of their two bodies burnt again into that old cottage that was haunted already by so much by gone physical desire you could not be in the dark room for an hour without the influences coming over you the hot blood desire of by gone yeomen there in this old den where they had lusted and bred for so many generations the silent house dark with thick timbered walls and the big black chimney place and the sense of secrecy dark with low little windows sunk into the earth dark like a lair where strong beasts had lurked and mated lonely at night and lonely by day left to themselves and their own intensity for so many generations it seemed to cast a spell on the two young people they became different there was a curious secret glow about them a certain slumbering flame hard to understand that enveloped them both they too felt that they did not belong to the london world any more crockham had changed their blood the sense of the snakes that lived and slept even in their own garden in the sun so that he going forward with the spade would see a curious coiled brownish pile on the black soil which suddenly would start up hiss and dazzle rapidly away hissing one day winifred heard the strangest scream from the flower bed under the low window of the living room ah the strangest scream like the very soul of the dark past crying aloud she ran out and saw a long brown snake on the flower bed and in its flat mouth the one hind leg of a frog was striving to escape and screaming its strange tiny bellowing scream she looked at the snake and from its sullen flat head it looked at her obstinately she gave a cry and it released the frog and slid angrily away that was crockham the spear of modern invention had not passed through it and it lay there secret primitive savage as when the saxons first came and egbert and she were caught there caught out of the world he was not idle nor was she there were plenty of things to be done the house to be put into final repair after the workmen had gone cushions and curtains to sew the paths to make the water to fetch and attend to and then the slope of the deep soiled neglected garden to level to terrace with little terraces and paths and to fill with flowers he worked away in his shirt sleeves worked all day intermittently doing this thing and the other and she quiet and rich in herself seeing him stooping and labouring away by himself would come to help him to be near him he of course was an amateur a born amateur he worked so hard and did so little and nothing he ever did would hold together for long if he terraced the garden he held up the earth with a couple of long narrow planks that soon began to bend with the pressure from behind and would not need many years to rot through and break and let the soil slither all down again in a heap towards the stream bed but there you are he had not been brought up to come to grips with anything and he thought it would do nay he did not think there was anything else except little temporary contrivances possible he who had such a passion for his old enduring cottage and for the old enduring things of the bygone england curious that the sense of permanency in the past had such a hold over him whilst in the present he was all amateurish and sketchy winifred could not criticize him town bred everything seemed to her splendid and the very digging and shovelling itself seemed romantic but neither egbert nor she yet

resemblance to an owl perched upon the edge of its nest hole he was busily engaged in doing nothing and in staring into nothingness as according to tom was his habit when communing with what he tom called his dratted speerits customer said tom in a harsh voice sorry to disturb you at your prayers guv nor but not having two pair of hands i can t serve a crowd meaning the old woman of the undergarments and myself mr potts slid off his stool and prepared for action when he saw however who the customer was he bristled that is the only word for it the truth is that although between us there was an inward and spiritual sympathy there was also an outward and visible hostility twice i had outbid mr potts at a local auction for articles which he desired moreover after the fashion of every good collector he felt it to be his duty to hate me as another collector lastly several times i had offered him smaller sums for antiques upon which he set a certain monetary value it is true that long ago i had given up this bargaining for the reason that mr potts would never take less than he asked indeed he followed the example of the vendor of the sibylline books in ancient rome he did not destroy the goods indeed after the fashion of that person and demand the price of all of them for the one that remained but invariably he put up his figure by per cent and nothing would induce him to take off one farthing what do you want sir he said grumpily vests hose collars or socks oh socks i think i replied at hazard thinking that they would be easiest to carry whereupon mr potts produced some peculiarly objectionable and shapeless woollen articles which he almost threw at me saying that they were all he had in stock now i detest woollen socks and never wear them still i made a purchase thinking with sympathy of my old gardener whose feet they would soon be scratching and while the parcel was being tied up said in an insinuating voice anything fresh upstairs mr potts no sir he answered shortly at least not much and if there were what s the use of showing them to you after the business about that clock it was you wanted for it mr potts i asked no sir it was and now it s per cent on to that you can work out the sum for yourself well let s have another look at it mr potts i replied humbly whereon with a grunt and a muttered injunction to tom to mind the shop he led the way upstairs now the house in which mr potts dwelt had once been of considerable pretensions and was very very old elizabethan i should think although it had been refronted with a horrible stucco to suit modern tastes the oak staircase was good though narrow and led to numerous small rooms upon two floors above some of which rooms were panelled and had oak beams now whitewashed like the panelling at least they had once been whitewashed probably in the last generation these rooms were literally crammed with every sort of old furniture most of it decrepit though for many of the articles dealers would have given a good price but at dealers mr potts drew the line not one of them had ever set a foot upon that oaken stair to the attics the place was filled with this furniture and other articles such as books china samplers with the glass broken and i know not what besides piled in heaps upon the floor indeed where mr potts slept was a mystery either it must have been under the counter in his shop or perhaps at nights he inhabited a worm eaten jacobean bedstead which stood in an attic for i observed a kind of pathway to it running through a number of legless chairs also some dirty blankets between the moth riddled curtains not far from this bedstead propped in an intoxicated way against the sloping wall of the old house stood the clock which i desired it was one of the first regulator clocks with a wooden pendulum used by the maker himself to check the time keeping of all his other clocks and enclosed in a chaste and perfect mahogany case of the very best style of its period so beautiful was it indeed that it had been an instance of love at first sight between us and although there was an estrangement on the matter of settlements or in other words over the question of price now i felt that never more could that clock and i be parted so i agreed to give old potts the or to be accurate s which he asked on the per cent rise principle thankful in my heart that he had not made it more and prepared to go as i turned however my eye fell upon a large chest of the almost indestructible yellow cypress wood of which were made it is said the doors of st peter s at rome that stood for eight hundred years and for aught i know are still standing as good as on the day when they were put up marriage coffer said potts answering my unspoken question italian about i suggested

the walls and the saxon pirate from over the water who will succeed to our rule where we saved they will slay where we built they will burn where we planted they will ravage but the die is cast crassus you will carry out the orders i will send out the messengers within an hour this very morning there has come news that the barbarians are through the old gap in the wall and their outriders as far south as vinovia the governor shrugged his shoulders these things concern us no longer said he then a bitter smile broke upon his aquiline clean shaven face whom think you that i see in audience this morning nay i know not caradoc and regnus and celticus the icenian who like so many of the richer britons have been educated at rome and who would lay before me their plans as to the ruling of this country and what is their plan that they themselves should do it the roman soldier laughed well they will have their will said he as he saluted and turned upon his heel farewell your excellency there are hard days coming for you and for me an hour later the british deputation was ushered into the presence of the governor they were good steadfast men men who with a whole heart and at some risk to themselves had taken up their country s cause so far as they could see it at the same time they well knew that under the mild and beneficent rule of rome it was only when they passed from words to deeds that their backs or their necks would be in danger they stood now earnest and a little abashed before the throne of the viceroy celticus was a swarthy black bearded little iberian caradoc and regnus were tall middle aged men of the fair flaxen british type all three were dressed in the draped yellow toga after the latin fashion instead of in the brac and tunic which distinguished their more insular fellow countrymen well asked the governor we are here said celticus boldly as the spokesmen of a great number of our fellow countrymen for the purpose of sending our petition through you to the emperor and to the roman senate that we may urge upon them the policy of allowing us to govern this country after our own ancient fashion he paused as if awaiting some outburst as an answer to his own temerity but the governor merely nodded his head as a sign that he should proceed we had laws of our own before ever c sar set foot in britain which have served their purpose since first our forefathers came from the land of ham we are not a child among the nations but our history goes back in our own traditions further even than that of rome and we are galled by this yoke which you have laid upon us are not our laws just asked the governor the code of c sar is just but it is always the code of c sar our own laws were made for our own uses and our own circumstances and we would fain have them again you speak roman as if you had been bred in the forum you wear a roman toga your hair is filleted in roman fashion are not these the gifts of rome we would take all the learning and all the arts that rome or greece could give but we would still be britain and ruled by britons the viceroy smiled by the rood of saint helena said he had you spoken thus to some of my heathen ancestors there would have been an end to your politics that you have dared to stand before my face and say as much is a proof for ever of the gentleness of our rule but i would reason with you for a moment upon this your request you know well that this land has never been one kingdom but was always under many chiefs and many tribes who have made war upon each other would you in very truth have it so again those were in the evil pagan days the days of the druid and the oak grove your excellency but now we are held together by a gospel of peace the viceroy shook his head if all the world were of the same way of thinking then it would be easier said he it may be that this blessed doctrine of peace will be little help to you when you are face to face with strong men who still worship the god of war what would you do against the picts of the north your excellency knows that many of the bravest legionaries are of british blood these are our defence but discipline man the power to command the knowledge of war the strength to act it is in these things that you would fail too long have you leaned upon the crutch the times may be hard but when we have gone through them britain will be herself again nay she will be under a different and a harsher master said the roman already the pirates swarm upon the eastern coast were it not for our roman count of the saxon shore they would land to morrow i see the day when britain may indeed be one but that will be because you and your fellows are either dead or are driven into the mountains of the west all goes into the melting pot and if a better albion should come forth from it it will be after ages of strife and neither you nor your people will have part or lot in it regnus the tall young celt smiled with the help of god and our own right arms we should hope for a better end said he give us but the chance and we will bear the brunt you are as men that are lost said the viceroy sadly i see this broad land with its gardens and orchards its fair villas and its walled towns its bridges and its roads all the work of rome surely it will pass even as a dream and these three hundred years of settled order will leave no trace behind for learn that it will indeed be as you wish and that this very day the orders have come to me that the legions are to go the three britons looked at each

grasp in that moment of pure observation on which we pride ourselves is not alien to the principle of classification but deeper we could if we liked make excellent comment upon the nature of provincial spaniards or of destitution as misery is called by the philanthropists or on homes for working girls but such is not our intention we aim at experience in the particular centres in which alone it is evil we avoid classification we do not deny it but when a man is classified something is lost the majority of mankind live on paper currency they use terms which are merely good for so much reality they never see actual coinage i should go even further than that said eeldrop the majority not only have no language to express anything save generalized man they are for the most part unaware of themselves as anything but generalized men they are first of all government officials or pillars of the church or trade unionists or poets or unemployed this cataloguing is not only satisfactory to other people for practical purposes it is sufficient to themselves for their life of the spirit many are not quite real at any moment when wolstrip married i am sure he said to himself now i am consummating the union of two of the best families in philadelphia the question is said appleplex what is to be our philosophy this must be settled at once mrs howexden recommends me to read bergson he writes very entertainingly on the structure of the eye of the frog not at all interrupted his friend our philosophy is quite irrelevant the essential is that our philosophy should spring from our point of view and not return upon itself to explain our point of view a philosophy about intuition is somewhat less likely to be intuitive than any other we must avoid having a platform but at least said appleplex we are individualists no nor anti intellectualists these also are labels the individualist is a member of a mob as fully as any other man and the mob of individualists is the most unpleasing because it has the least character nietzsche was a mob man just as bergson is an intellectualist we cannot escape the label but let it be one which carries no distinction and arouses no self consciousness sufficient that we should find simple labels and not further exploit them i am i confess to you in private life a bank clerk and should according to your own view have a wife three children and a vegetable garden in a suburb said appleplex such is precisely the case returned eeldrop but i had not thought it necessary to mention this biographical detail as it is saturday night i shall return to my suburb tomorrow will be spent in that garden i shall pay my call on mrs howexden murmured appleplex ii the suburban evening was grey and yellow on sunday the gardens of the small houses to left and right were rank with ivy and tall grass and lilac bushes the tropical south london verdure was dusty above and mouldy below the tepid air swarmed with flies eeldrop at the

said eeldrop i often think of scheherazade and wonder what has become of her appleplex rose without speaking and turned to the files which contained the documents for his survey of contemporary society he removed the file marked london from between the files barcelona and boston where it had been misplaced and turned over the papers rapidly the lady you mention he rejoined at last whom i

letter from her mother in honolulu on ruled paper a poem written on a restaurant bill to atthis and a letter by herself on lady equistep s best notepaper containing some damaging but entertaining information about lady equistep then there are my own few observations on two sheets of foolscap edith murmured eeldrop who had not been attending to this catalogue i wonder what has become of her not pleasure but fulness of life to burn ever with a hard gem like flame those were her words what curiosity and passion for experience perhaps that flame has burnt itself out by now you ought to inform yourself better said appleplex severely edith dines sometimes with mrs howexden who tells me that her passion for experience has taken her to a russian pianist in bayswater she is also said to be present often at the anarchist tea rooms and can usually be found in the evening at the cafe de l orangerie well replied eeldrop i confess that i prefer to wonder what has become of her i do not like to think of her future scheherazade grown old i see her grown very plump full bosomed with blond hair living in a small flat with a maid walking in the park with a pekinese motoring with a jewish stock broker with a fierce appetite for food and drink when all other appetite is gone all other appetite gone except the insatiable increasing appetite of vanity rolling on two wide legs rolling in motorcars rolling toward a diabetic end in a seaside watering place just now you saw that bright flame burning itself out said appleplex now you see it guttering thickly which proves that your vision

298,1922,The Beautiful and the Damned,in a minute he was following gloria down a garden walk between tall rose bushes her parasol brushing gently the june blooming leaves most inconsiderate he thought as they reached the road he felt with injured na vete that gloria should not have interrupted such innocent and harmless enjoyment the whiskey had both soothed and clarified the restless things in his mind it occurred to him that she had taken this same attitude several times before was he always to retreat from pleasant episodes at a touch of her parasol or a flicker of her eye his unwillingness blurred to ill will which rose within him like a resistless bubble he kept silent perversely inhibiting a desire to reproach her they found a taxi in front of the inn rode silently to the little station then anthony knew what he wanted to assert his will against this cool and impervious girl to obtain with one magnificent effort a mastery that seemed infinitely desirable,4

distinctively social aspects of london the general artlessly histrionised air of things caused so many examples to spring from behind any hedge what came up however at once for my own stretched canvas was that it would have to be ample give me really space to turn round and that a single illustrative case might easily be meagre fare the young man who should chuck admired politics and of course some other admired object with them would be all very well but he wouldn t be enough therefore what should one say to some other young man who would chuck something and somebody else admired in their way too there need never at the worst be any difficulty about the things advantageously chuckable for art the question is all but of choosing them in the heap yet were i to represent a struggle an interesting one indispensably with the passions of the theatre as a profession or at least as an absorption i should have to place the theatre in another light than the satiric this however would by good luck be perfectly possible too without a sacrifice of truth and i should doubtless even be able to make my theatric case as important as i might desire it it seemed clear that i needed big cases small ones would practically give my central idea away and i make out now my still labouring under the illusion that the case of the sacrifice for art can ever be with truth with taste with discretion involved apparently and showily big i daresay it glimmered upon me even then that the very sharpest difficulty of the victim of the conflict i should seek to represent and the very highest interest of his predicament dwell deep in the fact that his repudiation of the great obvious great moral or functional or useful character shall just have to consent to resemble a surrender for absolutely nothing those characters are all large and expansive seated and established and endowed whereas the most charming truth about the preference for art is that to parade abroad so thoroughly inward and so naturally embarrassed a matter is to falsify and vulgarise it that as a preference attended with the honours of publicity it is indeed nowhere that in fact under the rule of its sincerity its only honours are those of contradiction concentration and a seemingly deplorable indifference to everything but itself nothing can well figure as less big in an honest thesis than a marked instance of somebody s willingness to pass mainly for an ass of these things i must i say have been in strictness aware what i perhaps failed of was to note that if a certain romantic glamour even that of mere eccentricity or of a fine perversity may be flung over the act of exchange of a career for the esthetic life in general the prose and the modesty of the matter yet come in with any exhibition of the particular branch of esthetics selected then it is that the attitude of hero or heroine may look too much for the romantic effect like a low crouching over proved trifles art indeed has in our day taken on so many honours and emoluments that the recognition of its importance is more than a custom has become on occasion almost a fury the line is drawn especially in the english world only at the importance of heeding what it may mean the more i turn my pieces over at any rate the more i now see i must have found in them and i remember how once well in presence of my three typical examples my fear of too ample a canvas quite dropped the only question was that if i had marked my political case from so far back for a story by itself and then marked my theatrical case for another the joining together of these interests originally seen as separate might all disgracefully betray the seam show for mechanical and superficial a story was a story a picture a picture and i had a mortal horror of two stories two pictures in one the reason of this was the clearest my subject was immediately under that disadvantage so cheated of its indispensable centre as to become of no more use for expressing a main intention than a wheel without a hub is of use for moving a cart it was a fact apparently that one had on occasion seen two pictures in one were there not for instance certain sublime tintorettos at venice a measureless crucifixion in especial which showed without loss of authority half a dozen actions separately taking place yes that might be but there had surely been nevertheless a mighty pictorial fusion so that the virtue of composition had somehow thereby come all mysteriously to its own of course the affair would be simple enough if composition could be kept out of the question yet by what art or process what bars and bolts what unmuzzled dogs and pointed guns perform that feat i had to know myself utterly inapt for any such valour and recognise that to make it possible sundry things should have begun for me much further back than i had felt them even in their dawn a picture without composition slights its most precious chance for beauty and is moreover not composed at all unless the painter knows how that principle of health and safety working as an absolutely premeditated art has prevailed there may in its absence be life incontestably as the newcomes has life as les trois mousquetaires as tolstoi s peace and war have it but what do such large loose baggy monsters with their queer elements of the accidental and the arbitrary artistically mean we have heard it maintained we well remember that such things are superior to art but we understand least of all what that may mean and we look in vain for the artist the divine explanatory genius who will come to our aid and tell us there is life and life and as waste is only life sacrificed and thereby prevented from counting i delight in a deep breathing economy and an orga,4
295,1922,The Curious Case of Benjamin Button,he was taken from the kindergarten his nurse nana in her starched gingham dress became the centre of his tiny world on bright days they walked in the park nana would point at a great gray monster and say elephant and benjamin would say it after her and when he was being undressed for bed that night he would say it over and over aloud to her elyphant elyphant elyphant sometimes nana let him jump on the bed which was fun because if you sat down exactly right it would bounce you up on your feet again and if you said ah for a long time while you jumped you got a very pleasing broken vocal effect he loved to take a big cane from the hat rack and go around hitting chairs and tables with it and saying fight fight fight when there were people there the old ladies would cluck at him which interested him and the young ladies would try to kiss him which he submitted to with mild boredom and when the long day was done at five o clock he would go upstairs with nana and be fed on oatmeal and nice soft mushy foods with a spoon,4

disappearing behind it your presence here may be considered a matter of taste he fired off as a parting shot i call it damned bad taste mr jacob pratt sat like a hurt thing till the train stopped at the next station then he stumbled out on to the platform and making his way through an unaccountable mist he climbed somehow or other into a third class carriage richard dauncey the melancholy man who lived in the cottage opposite to his looked up at the newcomer s entrance and for the first time within his recollection jacob saw him smile good morning mr pratt the former said with a strenuous attempt at cordiality if you ll excuse my saying so that s the finest rose i ve ever seen in my life richard dauncey made his fortune by that speech and jacob had to swallow very hard and look very fixedly out of the window chapter i precisely two years later jacob pratt sat once more in his cottage sitting room contemplating the remains of a barely tasted breakfast before him read for the fiftieth time were the wonderful letters in his brain a most amazing confusion in his heart an almost hysterical joy presently mrs harris brought in his hat and stick you ll excuse my mentioning it sir she said looking at the former a little disparagingly but brush though i may there s no doing much with this hat of yours the nap s fair gone maybe you haven t noticed it sir but with the summer coming on a straw hat i ll buy a straw hat to day mrs harris jacob promised and you ll be home at the usual time for your supper sir i i expect so i am not quite sure mrs harris i shall be home sometime during the day all right mrs harris shook her head at the sight of the untasted egg you ll excuse my saying so sir she pronounced severely but there s no good work done on an empty stomach times is hard as we all know but eggs is cheap mrs harris jacob reminded her it is two years since i left one of your eggs i left it then because i was miserable i am leaving it this morning because i have had good news i can t eat later on later on mrs harris and a bit of good news is what you deserve sir the latter declared lingering while he cut his accustomed rose with fingers which trembled strangely thank you very much mrs harris he said when i come back to night i ll tell you all about it once more then two years almost to a day after mr edward bultiwell of the great firm of bultiwell and sons had laid down his newspaper and spoken his mind jacob was on his way to the station again wearing a choice rose in his buttonhole he had found no occasion to change his lodgings for he had been an economical man who took great care of his possessions even in the days of his prosperity and his moderate salary as traveller for a bermondsey firm of merchants brought him in quite enough for his simple needs he had to some extent lived down his disgrace the manager of the international stores nodded to him now a trifle condescendingly yet with tacit acknowledgement of the fact that in domestic affairs jacob was a man of principle who always paid his way the greengrocer s wife passed the time of day when not too preoccupied and the newspaper boy no longer clutched for his penny jacob generally met the melancholy man at the corner of the avenue and walked to the station with him and he still grew roses and worshipped them on the way to the station on this particular morning he amazed his friend richard he said i shall not travel to the city with you to day at least i shall not start with you i shall change carriages at wendley as i did once before the devil richard exclaimed they were passing the plate glass window of a new emporium and jacob paused to glance furtively at his reflection he was an exceedingly neat man and his care for his clothes and person had survived two years of impecuniosity nevertheless although he passed muster well enough to the casual observer there were indications in his attire of the inevitable conflict between a desire for adornment and the lack of means to indulge it his too often pressed trousers were thin at the seams his linen thoug,4

the cathedral of worcester during the years he had served as master of fence at the english court the sons of royalty had learned to thrust and parry and cut as only de vac could teach the art and he had been as conscientious in the discharge of his duties as he had been in his unswerving hatred and contempt for his pupils and now the english king had put upon him such an insult as might only be wiped out by blood as the blow fell the wiry frenchman clicked his heels together and throwing down his foil he stood erect and rigid as a marble statue before his master white and livid was his tense drawn face but he spoke no word he might have struck the king but then there would have been left to him no alternative save death by his own hand for a king may not fight with a lesser mortal and he who strikes a king may not live the king s honor must be satisfied had a french king struck him de vac would have struck back and gloried in the fate which permitted him to die for the honor of france but an english king pooh a dog and who would die for a dog no de vac would find other means of satisfying his wounded pride he would revel in revenge against this man for whom he felt no loyalty if possible he would harm the whole of england if he could but he would bide his time he could afford to wait for his opportunity if by waiting he could encompass a more terrible revenge de vac had been born in paris the son of a french officer reputed the best swordsman in france the son had followed closely in the footsteps of his father until on the latter s death he could easily claim the title of his sire how he had left france and entered the service of john of england is not of this story all the bearing that the life of jules de vac has upon the history of england hinges upon but two of his many attributes his wonderful swordsmanship and his fearful hatred for his adopted country chapter ii south of the armory of westminster palace lay the gardens and here on the third day following the king s affront to de vac might have been a seen a black haired woman gowned in a violet cyclas richly embroidered with gold about the yoke and at the bottom of the loose pointed sleeves which reached almost to the similar bordering on the lower hem of the garment a richly wrought leathern girdle studded with precious stones and held in place by a huge carved buckle of gold clasped the garment about her waist so that the upper portion fell outward over the girdle after the manner of a blouse in the girdle was a long dagger of beautiful workmanship dainty sandals encased her feet while a wimple of violet silk bordered in gold fringe lay becomingly over her head and shoulders by her side walked a handsome boy of about three clad like his companion in gay colors his tiny surcoat of scarlet velvet was rich with embroidery while beneath was a close fitting tunic of white silk his doublet was of scarlet while his long hose of white were cross gartered with scarlet from his tiny sandals to his knees on the back of his brown curls sat a flat brimmed round crowned hat in which a single plume of white waved and nodded bravely at each move of the proud little head the child s features were well molded and his frank bright eyes gave an expression of boyish generosity to a face which otherwise would have been too arrogant and haughty for such a mere baby as he talked with his companion little flashes of peremptory authority and dignity which sat strangely upon one so tiny caused the young woman at times to turn her head from him that he might not see the smiles which she could scarce repress presently the boy took a ball from his tunic and pointing at a little bush near them said stand you there lady maud by yonder bush i would play at toss the young woman did as she was bid and when she had taken her place and turned to face him the boy threw the ball to her thus they played beneath the windows of the armory the boy running blithely after the ball when he missed it and laughing and shouting in happy glee when he made a particularly good catch in one of the windows of the armory overlooking the garden stood a grim gray old man leaning upon his folded arms his brows drawn together in a malignant scowl the corners of his mouth set in a stern cold line he looked upon the garden and the playing child and upon the lovely young woman beneath him but with eyes which did not see for de vac was working out a great problem the greatest of all his life for three days the old man had brooded over his grievance seeking for some means to be revenged upon the king for the insult which henry had put upon him many schemes had presented themselves to his shrewd and cunning mind but so far all had been rejected as unworthy of the terrible satisfaction which his wounded pride demanded his fancies had for the most part revolved about the unsettled political conditions of henry s reign for from these he felt he might wrest that opportunity which could be turned to his own personal uses and to the harm and possibly the undoing of the king for years an inmate of the palace and often a listener in the armory when the king played at sword with his friends and favorites de vac had heard much which passed between henry iii and his intimates that could well be turned to the king s harm by a shrewd and resourceful enemy with all england he knew the utter contempt in which henry held the terms of the magna charta which he so often violated along with his kingly oath to maintain it but what all england did not know de vac had gleaned from scraps of conversation dropped in the armory that henry was even now negotiating with the leaders of foreign mercenaries and with louis ix of france for a sufficient force of knights and men at arms to wage

alone it is evil we avoid classification we do not deny it but when a man is classified something is lost the majority of mankind live on paper currency they use terms which are merely good for so much reality they never see actual coinage i should go even further than that said eeldrop the majority not only have no language to express anything save generalized man they are for the most part unaware of themselves as anything but generalized men they are first of all government officials or pillars of the church or trade unionists or poets or unemployed this cataloguing is not only satisfactory to other people for practical purposes it is sufficient to themselves for their life of the spirit many are not quite real at any moment when wolstrip married i am sure he said to himself now i am consummating the union of two of the best families in philadelphia the question is said appleplex what is to be our philosophy this must be settled at once mrs howexden recommends me to read bergson he writes very entertainingly on the structure of the eye of the frog not at all interrupted his friend our philosophy is quite irrelevant the essential is that our philosophy should spring from our point of view and not return upon itself to explain our point of view a philosophy about intuition is somewhat less likely to be intuitive than any other we must avoid having a platform but at least said appleplex we are individualists no nor anti intellectualists these also are labels the individualist is a member of a mob as fully as any other man and the mob of individualists is the most unpleasing because it has the least character nietzsche was a mob man just as bergson is an intellectualist we cannot escape the label but let it be one which carries no distinction and arouses no self consciousness sufficient that we should find simple labels and not further exploit them i am i confess to you in private life a bank clerk and should according to your own view have a wife three children and a vegetable garden in a suburb said appleplex such is precisely the case returned eeldrop but i had not thought it necessary to mention this biographical detail as it is saturday night i shall return to my suburb tomorrow will be spent in that garden i shall pay my call on mrs howexden murmured appleplex ii the suburban evening was grey and yellow on sunday the gardens of the small houses to left and right were rank with ivy and tall grass and lilac bushes the tropical south london verdure was dusty above and mouldy below the tepid air swarmed with flies eeldrop at the

society he removed the file marked london from between the files barcelona and boston where it had been misplaced and turned over the papers rapidly the lady you mention he rejoined at last whom i

letter from her mother in honolulu on ruled paper a poem written on a restaurant bill to atthis and a letter by herself on lady equistep s best notepaper containing some damaging but entertaining information about lady equistep then there are my own few observations on two sheets of foolscap edith murmured eeldrop who had not been attending to this catalogue i wonder what has become of her not pleasure but fulness of life to burn ever with a hard gem like flame those were her words what curiosity and passion for experience perhaps that flame has burnt itself out by now you ought to inform yourself better said appleplex severely edith dines sometimes with mrs howexden who tells me that her passion for experience has taken her to a russian pianist in bayswater she is also said to be present often at the anarchist tea rooms and can usually be found in the evening at the cafe de l orangerie well replied eeldrop i confess that i prefer to wonder what has become of her i do not like to think of her future scheherazade grown old i see her grown very plump full bosomed with blond hair living in a small flat with a maid walking in the park with a pekinese motoring with a jewish stock broker with a fierce appetite for food and drink when all other appetite is gone all other appetite gone except the insatiable increasing appetite of vanity rolling on two wide legs rolling in motorcars rolling toward a diabetic end in a seaside watering place just now you saw that bright flame burning itself out said appleplex now you see it guttering thickly which proves that your vision

crassus you will carry out the orders i will send out the messengers within an hour this very morning there has come news that the barbarians are through the old gap in the wall and their outriders as far south as vinovia the governor shrugged his shoulders these things concern us no longer said he then a bitter smile broke upon his aquiline clean shaven face whom think you that i see in audience this morning nay i know not caradoc and regnus and celticus the icenian who like so many of the richer britons have been educated at rome and who would lay before me their plans as to the ruling of this country and what is their plan that they themselves should do it the roman soldier laughed well they will have their will said he as he saluted and turned upon his heel farewell your excellency there are hard days coming for you and for me an hour later the british deputation was ushered into the presence of the governor they were good steadfast men men who with a whole heart and at some risk to themselves had taken up their country s cause so far as they could see it at the same time they well knew that under the mild and beneficent rule of rome it was only when they passed from words to deeds that their backs or their necks would be in danger they stood now earnest and a little abashed before the throne of the viceroy celticus was a swarthy black bearded little iberian caradoc and regnus were tall middle aged men of the fair flaxen british type all three were dressed in the draped yellow toga after the latin fashion instead of in the brac and tunic which distinguished their more insular fellow countrymen well asked the governor we are here said celticus boldly as the spokesmen of a great number of our fellow countrymen for the purpose of sending our petition through you to the emperor and to the roman senate that we may urge upon them the policy of allowing us to govern this country after our own ancient fashion he paused as if awaiting some outburst as an answer to his own temerity but the governor merely nodded his head as a sign that he should proceed we had laws of our own before ever c sar set foot in britain which have served their purpose since first our forefathers came from the land of ham we are not a child among the nations but our history goes back in our own traditions further even than that of rome and we are galled by this yoke which you have laid upon us are not our laws just asked the governor the code of c sar is just but it is always the code of c sar our own laws were made for our own uses and our own circumstances and we would fain have them again you speak roman as if you had been bred in the forum you wear a roman toga your hair is filleted in roman fashion are not these the gifts of rome we would take all the learning and all the arts that rome or greece could give but we would still be britain and ruled by britons the viceroy smiled by the rood of saint helena said he had you spoken thus to some of my heathen ancestors there would have been an end to your politics that you have dared to stand before my face and say as much is a proof for ever of the gentleness of our rule but i would reason with you for a moment upon this your request you know well that this land has never been one kingdom but was always under many chiefs and many tribes who have made war upon each other would you in very truth have it so again those were in the evil pagan days the days of the druid and the oak grove your excellency but now we are held together by a gospel of peace the viceroy shook his head if all the world were of the same way of thinking then it would be easier said he it may be that this blessed doctrine of peace will be little help to you when you are face to face with strong men who still worship the god of war what would you do against the picts of the north your excellency knows that many of the bravest legionaries are of british blood these are our defence but discipline man the power to command the knowledge of war the strength to act it is in these things that you would fail too long have you leaned upon the crutch the times may be hard but when we have gone through them britain will be herself again nay she will be under a different and a harsher master said the roman already the pirates swarm upon the eastern coast were it not for our roman count of the saxon shore they would land to morrow i see the day when britain may indeed be one but that will be because you and your fellows are either dead or are driven into the mountains of the west all goes into the melting pot and if a better albion should come forth from it it will be after ages of strife and neither you nor your people will have part or lot in it regnus the tall young celt smiled with the help of god and our own right arms we should hope for a better end said he give us but the chance and we will bear the brunt you are as men that are lost said the viceroy sadly i see this broad land with its gardens and orchards its fair villas and its walled towns its bridges and its roads all the work of rome surely it will pass even as a dream and these three hundred years of settled order will leave no trace behind for learn that it will indeed be as you wish and that this very day the orders have come to me that the legions are to go the three britons looked at each

now begin to hypnotize us again our own impulse towards our own scientific way of understanding being almost spent and so besides myths we find the same mathematic figures cosmic graphs which remain among the aboriginal peoples in all continents mystic figures and signs whose true cosmic or scientific significance is lost yet which continue in use for purposes of conjuring or divining if my reader finds this bosh and abracadabra all right for him only i have no more regard for his little crowings on his own little dunghill myself i am not so sure that i am one of the one and onlies i like the wide world of centuries and vast ages mammoth worlds beyond our day and mankind so wonderful in his distances his history that has no beginning yet always the pomp and the magnificence of human splendor unfolding through the earth s changing periods floods and fire and convulsions and ice arrest intervene between the great glamorous civilizations of mankind but nothing will ever quench humanity and the human potentiality to evolve something magnificent out of a renewed chaos i do not believe in evolution but in the strangeness and rainbow change of ever renewed creative civilizations so much then for my claim to remarkable discoveries i believe i am only trying to stammer out the first terms of a forgotten knowledge but i have no desire to revive dead kings or dead sages it is not for me to arrange fossils and decipher hieroglyphic phrases i couldn t do it if i wanted to but then i can do something else the soul must take the hint from the relics our scientists have so marvelously gathered out of the forgotten past and from the hint develop a new living utterance the spark is from dead wisdom but the fire is life and as an example a very simple one of how a scientist of the most innocent modern sort may hint at truths which when stated he would laugh at as fantastic nonsense let us quote a word from the already old fashioned golden bough it must have appeared to the ancient aryan that the sun was periodically recruited from the fire which resided in the sacred oak exactly the fire which resided in the tree of life that is life itself so we must read it must have appeared to the ancient aryan that the sun was periodically recruited from life which is what the early greek philosophers were always saying and which still seems to me the real truth the clue to the cosmos instead of life being drawn from the sun it is the emanation from life itself that is from all the living plants and creatures which nourish the sun of course my dear critic the ancient aryans were just doddering the old duffers or babbling the babes but as for me i have some respect for my ancestors and believe they had more up their sleeve than just the marvel of the unborn me one last weary little word this pseudo philosophy of mine pollyanalytics as one of my respected critics might say is deduced from the novels and poems not the reverse the novels and poems come unwatched out of one s pen and then the absolute need which one has for some sort of satisfactory mental attitude towards oneself and things in general makes one try to abstract some definite conclusions from one s experiences as a writer and as a man the novels and poems are pure passionate experience these pollyanalytics are inferences made afterwards from the experience and finally it seems to me that even art is utterly dependent on philosophy or if you prefer it on a metaphysic the metaphysic or philosophy may not be anywhere very accurately stated and may be quite unconscious in the artist yet it is a metaphysic that governs men at the time and is by all men more or less comprehended and lived men live and see according to some gradually developing and gradually withering vision this vision exists also as a dynamic idea or metaphysic exists first as such then it is unfolded into life and art our vision our belief our metaphysic is wearing woefully thin and the art is wearing absolutely threadbare we have no future neither for our hopes nor our aims nor our art it has all gone gray and opaque we ve got to rip the old veil of a vision across and find what the heart really believes in after all and what the heart really wants for the next future and we ve got to put it down in terms of belief and of knowledge and then go forward again to the

gardens below and the rocks almost covered by the full swelling tide tall and looking slimmer than ever in his plain dinner garb there were some indications of an hour of strange and unexpected suffering in the tired face of the man who gazed out in somewhat dazed fashion at the little panorama which he had been looking forward so eagerly to seeing again throughout the long journey down from town he had felt an unusual and almost boyish enthusiasm for his coming holiday he had thought of his tennis racquet and fishing rods wondered about his golf clubs and his guns even the unexpected encounter with miller had done little more than leave an unpleasant taste in his mouth and then on his way down from up over as the natives called that little strip of moorland overhead he had vanished into the mist and had come out into another world andrew so you are out here why did you not come to my room surely your train was very punctual tallente remained for a moment tense and motionless then he turned around the woman who stood upon the threshold of the house framed with a little cascade of drooping roses sought for his eyes almost hungrily he realised how she must be feeling a dormant vein of cynicism parted his lips as he held her fingers for a moment his tone and his manner were quite natural we were i believe unusually punctual he admitted what an extraordinary mist up over there was no sign of it at all she shivered her eyes were still watching his face seeking for an answer to her unasked question blue eyes they were which had been beautiful in their day a little hard and anxious now she wore a white dress simple with the simplicity of supreme and expensive art a rope of pearls was her only ornament her hair was somewhat elaborately coiffured there was a touch of rouge upon her cheeks and the unscreened evening sunlight was scarcely kind to her rather wan features and carefully arranged complexion she still had her claims to beauty however tallente admitted that to himself as he stood there appraising her with a strange and almost impersonal regard his wife of thirteen years she was beautiful notwithstanding the strained look of anxiety which at that moment disfigured her face the lurking fear which made her voice sound artificial the nervousness which every moment made fresh demands upon her self restraint it came up from the sea she said

the cathedral of worcester during the years he had served as master of fence at the english court the sons of royalty had learned to thrust and parry and cut as only de vac could teach the art and he had been as conscientious in the discharge of his duties as he had been in his unswerving hatred and contempt for his pupils and now the english king had put upon him such an insult as might only be wiped out by blood as the blow fell the wiry frenchman clicked his heels together and throwing down his foil he stood erect and rigid as a marble statue before his master white and livid was his tense drawn face but he spoke no word he might have struck the king but then there would have been left to him no alternative save death by his own hand for a king may not fight with a lesser mortal and he who strikes a king may not live the king s honor must be satisfied had a french king struck him de vac would have struck back and gloried in the fate which permitted him to die for the honor of france but an english king pooh a dog and who would die for a dog no de vac would find other means of satisfying his wounded pride he would revel in revenge against this man for whom he felt no loyalty if possible he would harm the whole of england if he could but he would bide his time he could afford to wait for his opportunity if by waiting he could encompass a more terrible revenge de vac had been born in paris the son of a french officer reputed the best swordsman in france the son had followed closely in the footsteps of his father until on the latter s death he could easily claim the title of his sire how he had left france and entered the service of john of england is not of this story all the bearing that the life of jules de vac has upon the history of england hinges upon but two of his many attributes his wonderful swordsmanship and his fearful hatred for his adopted country chapter ii south of the armory of westminster palace lay the gardens and here on the third day following the king s affront to de vac might have been a seen a black haired woman gowned in a violet cyclas richly embroidered with gold about the yoke and at the bottom of the loose pointed sleeves which reached almost to the similar bordering on the lower hem of the garment a richly wrought leathern girdle studded with precious stones and held in place by a huge carved buckle of gold clasped the garment about her waist so that the upper portion fell outward over the girdle after the manner of a blouse in the girdle was a long dagger of beautiful workmanship dainty sandals encased her feet while a wimple of violet silk bordered in gold fringe lay becomingly over her head and shoulders by her side walked a handsome boy of about three clad like his companion in gay colors his tiny surcoat of scarlet velvet was rich with embroidery while beneath was a close fitting tunic of white silk his doublet was of scarlet while his long hose of white were cross gartered with scarlet from his tiny sandals to his knees on the back of his brown curls sat a flat brimmed round crowned hat in which a single plume of white waved and nodded bravely at each move of the proud little head the child s features were well molded and his frank bright eyes gave an expression of boyish generosity to a face which otherwise would have been too arrogant and haughty for such a mere baby as he talked with his companion little flashes of peremptory authority and dignity which sat strangely upon one so tiny caused the young woman at times to turn her head from him that he might not see the smiles which she could scarce repress presently the boy took a ball from his tunic and pointing at a little bush near them said stand you there lady maud by yonder bush i would play at toss the young woman did as she was bid and when she had taken her place and turned to face him the boy threw the ball to her thus they played beneath the windows of the armory the boy running blithely after the ball when he missed it and laughing and shouting in happy glee when he made a particularly good catch in one of the windows of the armory overlooking the garden stood a grim gray old man leaning upon his folded arms his brows drawn together in a malignant scowl the corners of his mouth set in a stern cold line he looked upon the garden and the playing child and upon the lovely young woman beneath him but with eyes which did not see for de vac was working out a great problem the greatest of all his life for three days the old man had brooded over his grievance seeking for some means to be revenged upon the king for the insult which henry had put upon him many schemes had presented themselves to his shrewd and cunning mind but so far all had been rejected as unworthy of the terrible satisfaction which his wounded pride demanded his fancies had for the most part revolved about the unsettled political conditions of henry s reign for from these he felt he might wrest that opportunity which could be turned to his own personal uses and to the harm and possibly the undoing of the king for years an inmate of the palace and often a listener in the armory when the king played at sword with his friends and favorites de vac had heard much which passed between henry iii and his intimates that could well be turned to the king s harm by a shrewd and resourceful enemy with all england he knew the utter contempt in which henry held the terms of the magna charta which he so often violated along with his kingly oath to maintain it but what all england did not know de vac had gleaned from scraps of conversation dropped in the armory that henry was even now negotiating with the leaders of foreign mercenaries and with louis ix of france for a sufficient force of knights and men at arms to wage

all sorts of people lie awake thinking of it i wish some of my damned committee would the doctor turned his eyes to the window i lie awake too he said and seemed to reflect but he was observing his patient acutely with his ears but you see how important it is said sir richmond and left his sentence unfinished i ll do what i can for you said the doctor and considered swiftly what line of talk he had best follow section this sense of a coming smash is epidemic said the doctor it s at the back of all sorts of mental trouble it is a new state of mind before the war it was abnormal a phase of neurasthenia now it is almost the normal state with whole classes of intelligent people intelligent i say the others always have been casual and adventurous and always will be a loss of confidence in the general background of life so that we seem to float over abysses we do said sir richmond and we have nothing but the old habits and ideas acquired in the days of our assurance there is a discord a jarring the doctor pursued his train of thought a new raw and dreadful sense of responsibility for the universe accompanied by a realization that the job is overwhelmingly too big for us we ve got to stand up to the job said sir richmond anyhow what else is there to do we may keep things together i ve got to do my bit and if only i could hold myself at it i could beat those fellows but that s

fatigue it s mental and moral fatigue too much effort on too high a level and too austere one strains and fags flags flags i meant to say one strains and flags and then the lower stuff in one the subconscious stuff takes control there was a flavour of popularized psychoanalysis about this and the doctor drew in the corners of his mouth and gave his head a critical slant m m but this only made sir richmond raise his voice and quicken his speech i want he said a good tonic a pick me up a stimulating harmless drug of some sort that s indicated anyhow to begin with something to pull me together as people say bring me up to the scratch again i don t like the use of drugs said the doctor the expectation of sir richmond s expression changed to disappointment but that s not reasonable

quiet an opiate what is life but response to stimulants or reaction after them when i m exhausted i want food when i m overactive and sleepless i want tranquillizing when i m dispersed i want pulling together but we don t know how to use drugs the doctor objected but you ought to know dr martineau fixed his eye on a first floor window sill on the opposite side of harley street his manner suggested a lecturer holding on to his theme a day will come when we shall be able to manipulate drugs all sorts of drugs and work them in to our general way of living i have no prejudice against them at all a time will come when we shall correct our moods get down to our reserves of energy by their help suspend fatigue put off sleep during long spells of exertion at some sudden crisis for example when we shall know enough to know just how far to go with this that or the other stuff and how to wash out its after effects i quite agree with you in principle but that time hasn t come yet decades of

distinctively social aspects of london the general artlessly histrionised air of things caused so many examples to spring from behind any hedge what came up however at once for my own stretched canvas was that it would have to be ample give me really space to turn round and that a single illustrative case might easily be meagre fare the young man who should chuck admired politics and of course some other admired object with them would be all very well but he wouldn t be enough therefore what should one say to some other young man who would chuck something and somebody else admired in their way too there need never at the worst be any difficulty about the things advantageously chuckable for art the question is all but of choosing them in the heap yet were i to represent a struggle an interesting one indispensably with the passions of the theatre as a profession or at least as an absorption i should have to place the theatre in another light than the satiric this however would by good luck be perfectly possible too without a sacrifice of truth and i should doubtless even be able to make my theatric case as important as i might desire it it seemed clear that i needed big cases small ones would practically give my central idea away and i make out now my still labouring under the illusion that the case of the sacrifice for art can ever be with truth with taste with discretion involved apparently and showily big i daresay it glimmered upon me even then that the very sharpest difficulty of the victim of the conflict i should seek to represent and the very highest interest of his predicament dwell deep in the fact that his repudiation of the great obvious great moral or functional or useful character shall just have to consent to resemble a surrender for absolutely nothing those characters are all large and expansive seated and established and endowed whereas the most charming truth about the preference for art is that to parade abroad so thoroughly inward and so naturally embarrassed a matter is to falsify and vulgarise it that as a preference attended with the honours of publicity it is indeed nowhere that in fact under the rule of its sincerity its only honours are those of contradiction concentration and a seemingly deplorable indifference to everything but itself nothing can well figure as less big in an honest thesis than a marked instance of somebody s willingness to pass mainly for an ass of these things i must i say have been in strictness aware what i perhaps failed of was to note that if a certain romantic glamour even that of mere eccentricity or of a fine perversity may be flung over the act of exchange of a career for the esthetic life in general the prose and the modesty of the matter yet come in with any exhibition of the particular branch of esthetics selected then it is that the attitude of hero or heroine may look too much for the romantic effect like a low crouching over proved trifles art indeed has in our day taken on so many honours and emoluments that the recognition of its importance is more than a custom has become on occasion almost a fury the line is drawn especially in the english world only at the importance of heeding what it may mean the more i turn my pieces over at any rate the more i now see i must have found in them and i remember how once well in presence of my three typical examples my fear of too ample a canvas quite dropped the only question was that if i had marked my political case from so far back for a story by itself and then marked my theatrical case for another the joining together of these interests originally seen as separate might all disgracefully betray the seam show for mechanical and superficial a story was a story a picture a picture and i had a mortal horror of two stories two pictures in one the reason of this was the clearest my subject was immediately under that disadvantage so cheated of its indispensable centre as to become of no more use for expressing a main intention than a wheel without a hub is of use for moving a cart it was a fact apparently that one had on occasion seen two pictures in one were there not for instance certain sublime tintorettos at venice a measureless crucifixion in especial which showed without loss of authority half a dozen actions separately taking place yes that might be but there had surely been nevertheless a mighty pictorial fusion so that the virtue of composition had somehow thereby come all mysteriously to its own of course the affair would be simple enough if composition could be kept out of the question yet by what art or process what bars and bolts what unmuzzled dogs and pointed guns perform that feat i had to know myself utterly inapt for any such valour and recognise that to make it possible sundry things should have begun for me much further back than i had felt them even in their dawn a picture without composition slights its most precious chance for beauty and is moreover not composed at all unless the painter knows how that principle of health and safety working as an absolutely premeditated art has prevailed there may in its absence be life incontestably as the newcomes has life as les trois mousquetaires as tolstoi s peace and war have it but what do such large loose baggy monsters with their queer elements of the accidental and the arbitrary artistically mean we have heard it maintained we well remember that such things are superior to art but we understand least of all what that may mean and we look in vain for the artist the divine explanatory genius who

other at one time of course but in the last two years i hadn t had so much as a post card from him i put all this to jeeves odd his coming to me still if he did he did no argument about that it must have been a nasty jar for the poor perisher when he found i wasn t here no sir mr fink nottle did not call to see you sir pull yourself together jeeves you ve just told me that this is what he has been doing and assiduously at that it was i with whom he was desirous of establishing communication sir you but i didn t know you had ever met him i had not had that pleasure until he called here sir but it appears that mr sipperley a fellow student of whom mr fink nottle had been at the university recommended him to place his affairs in my hands the mystery had conked i saw all as i dare say you know jeeves s reputation as a counsellor has long been established among the cognoscenti and the first move of any of my little circle on discovering themselves in any form of soup is always to roll round and put the thing up to him and when he s got a out of a bad spot a puts b on to him and then when he has fixed up b b sends c along and so on if you get my drift and so forth that s how these big consulting practices like jeeves s grow old sippy i knew had been deeply impressed by the man s efforts on his behalf at the time when he was trying to get engaged to elizabeth moon so it was not to be wondered at that he should have advised gussie to apply pure routine you might say oh you re acting for him are you yes sir now i follow now i understand and what is gussie s trouble oddly enough sir precisely the same as that of mr sipperley when i was enabled to be of assistance to him no doubt you recall mr sipperley s predicament sir deeply attached to miss moon he suffered from a rooted diffidence which made it impossible for him to speak i nodded i remember yes i recall the sipperley case he couldn t bring himself to the scratch a marked coldness of the feet was there not i recollect you saying he was letting what was it letting something do something cats entered into it if i am not mistaken letting i dare not wait upon i would sir that s right but how about the cats like the poor cat i the adage sir exactly it beats me how you think up these things and gussie you say is in the same posish yes sir each time he endeavours to formulate a proposal of marriage his courage fails him and yet if he wants this female to be his wife he s got to say so what i mean only civil to mention it precisely sir i mused well i suppose this was inevitable jeeves i wouldn t have thought that this fink nottle would ever have fallen a victim to the divine p but if he has no wonder he finds the going sticky yes sir look at the life he s led yes sir i don t suppose he has spoken to a girl for years what a lesson this is to us jeeves not to shut ourselves up in country houses and stare into glass tanks you can t be the dominant male if you do that sort of thing in this life you can choose between two courses you can either shut yourself up in a country house and stare into tanks or you can be a dasher with the sex you can t do both no sir i mused once more gussie and i as i say had rather lost touch but all the same i was exercised about the poor fish as i am about all my pals close or distant who find themselves treading upon life s banana skins it seemed to me that he was up against it i threw my mind back to the last time i had seen him about two years ago it had been i had looked in at his place while on a motor trip and he had put me right off my feed by bringing a couple of green things with legs to the luncheon table crooning over them like a young mother and eventually losing one of them in the salad that picture rising before my eyes didn t give me much confidence in the unfor,4

was seven years old large for his age a bold handsome lad with red hair mrs smith made a bargain with dick and led him back with her here panhandle took violent exception to having his pets killed or routed out by this boy he had never before seen he did not like his looks anyway but dick paid little heed to panhandle except once when mrs smith went into the house and then he knocked panhandle down for once panhandle did not squall he got up round eyed pale with his hands clenched he never said a word something was born in the depths of his gentle soul then dick tore a hole in the little wall of rocks that supported the porch and with a lighted torch on a stick he wormed his way in to rout out the skunks panhandle suddenly was thrilled and frightened by a bellowing from dick the boy came hurriedly backing out of the hole he fetched an odor with him that nearly suffocated panhandle so strange and raw and terrible was it dick s eyes were shut for the time being he had been blinded he bounced around like a chicken with its head cut off bawling wildly what had happened panhandle did not know but it certainly suited him goody goody he shouted holding his nose and edging away from the lad then panhandle saw smoke issuing from the hole under the porch the mother skunk and her kittens scampered out into the weeds he heard the crackle of flames that boy had dropped his torch under the porch screaming panhandle ran to alarm his mother but it was too late there were no men near at hand so nothing could be done panhandle stood crying beside his mother watching their little home burn to the ground somehow in his mind the boy dick had been to blame panhandle peered round to find him but he was gone never would panhandle forget that boy they walked to the uncle s house and spent the night there soon another home was under construction on the same site it was more of a shack than a house for building materials were scarce and the near approach of winter made hasty construction imperative winter came soon and panhandle and his mother were alone it was cold and they huddled over the little wood fire they had plenty to eat but were very uncomfortable in the one room shack bill smith came home but seldom that fall the valley had been overrun with homesteaders nesters they were called and these newcomers passed by often from the town drunk and rough panhandle used to lie awake a good deal during these lonely hours the moan of the prairie wind the mourn of wolves and yelp of coyotes became part of his existence he understood why his mother barred and blocked the one door placed the ax by the bed and the gun under her pillow even then he longed for the time when he would be old and big enough to protect her the lonely winter with its innumerable hours of solitude for mrs smith and the boy had incalculable influence upon his character she taught him much ways and things words and feelings that became an integral part of his life at last the long winter ended with spring came the gales of wind which though no longer cold were terrible in their violence many a night panhandle lay awake shrinking beside his mother fearing the shack would blow away over their heads many a day the sun was obscured and nothing could be cooked no work done while the dust storm raged as spring advanced with a lessening of the tornadoes a new and fascinating game came into panhandle s life it was to sit at the one little window and watch the cowboys ride by how he came to worship them they were on their way to the spring roundups his father had told him all about them panhandle would strain his eyes to get a first glimpse of them to count the shaggy prancing horses the lithe supple riders with their great sombreros their bright scarfs guns and chaps and boots and spurs their lassos how they fascinated panhandle ropes to whirl and throw at a running steer that was a game he resolved to play when he grew up and his mother discovering his interest made him a little reata and taught him how to throw it how to make loops and knots she told him how her people had owned horses thrown lassos run cattle panhandle was always watching for the cowboys when they passed by he would run to the other side of the shack where there was a knothole stuffed with a rag and through this he would peep until he was blinded by dust these were full days for the lad rousing in him wonder and awe eagerness and fear strange longings for he knew not what then one day his father brought home a black pony with three white feet and a white spot on his face panhandle was in rapture for him he could have burst for very joy but he could not speak it developed that his mother would not let him ride the pony except when she led it this roused as great a grief as possession was joy a beautiful little pony he could not ride ideas formed in his mind scintillated and grew into dark purpose one day he stole curly and led him out of sight behind the barn and mounting him rode down to the spring panhandle found himself alone he was free he was on the back of a horse mighty and incalculable fact curly felt the spirit of that occasion after drinking at the spring he broke into a lope panhandle stuck on somehow and turned the pony toward the house curly loped faster panhandle felt the wind in his hair he bounced up and down squealing with delight he twisted his hands in the flowing mane and held on at the top of the hill his joy became divided by fear curly kept on loping down the hill toward the house faster and faster panhandle bounced higher and higher up on his neck back on his haunches until suddenly his hold broke and he was thrown down,4

sense enough to see that ideas exist and eugenics itself in large quantities or small coming quickly or coming slowly urged from good motives or bad applied to a thousand people or applied to three eugenics itself is a thing no more to be bargained about than poisoning it is not really difficult to sum up the essence of eugenics though some of the eugenists seem to be rather vague about it the movement consists of two parts a moral basis which is common to all and a scheme of social application which varies a good deal for the moral basis it is obvious that man s ethical responsibility varies with his knowledge of consequences if i were in charge of a baby like dr johnson in that tower of vision and if the baby was ill through having eaten the soap i might possibly send for a doctor i might be calling him away from much more serious cases from the bedsides of babies whose diet had been far more deadly but i should be justified i could not be expected to know enough about his other patients to be obliged or even entitled to sacrifice to them the baby for whom i was primarily and directly responsible now the eugenic moral basis is this that the baby for whom we are primarily and directly responsible is the babe unborn that is that we know or may come to know enough of certain inevitable tendencies in biology to consider the fruit of some contemplated union in that direct and clear light of conscience which we can now only fix on the other partner in that union the one duty can conceivably be as definite as or more definite than the other the baby that does not exist can be considered even before the wife who does now it is essential to grasp that this is a comparatively new note in morality of course sane people always thought the aim of marriage was the procreation of children to the glory of god or according to the plan of nature but whether they counted such children as god s reward for service or nature s premium on sanity they always left the reward to god or the premium to nature as a less definable thing the only person and this is the point towards whom one could have precise duties was the partner in the process directly considering the partner s claims was the nearest one could get to indirectly considering the claims of posterity if the women of the harem sang praises of the hero as the moslem mounted his horse it was because this was the due of a man if the christian knight helped his wife off her horse it was because this was the due of a woman definite and detailed dues of this kind they did not predicate of the babe unborn regarding him in that agnostic and opportunist light in which mr browdie regarded the hypothetical child of miss squeers thinking these sex relations healthy they naturally hoped they would produce healthy children but that was all the moslem woman doubtless expected allah to send beautiful sons to an obedient wife but she would not have allowed any direct vision of such sons to alter the obedience itself she would not have said i will now be a disobedient wife as the learned leech informs me that great prophets are often the children of disobedient wives the knight doubtless hoped that the saints would help him to strong children if he did all the duties of his station one of which might be helping his wife off her horse but he would not have refrained from doing this because he had read in a book that a course of falling off horses often resulted in the birth of a genius both moslem and christian would have thought such speculations not only impious but utterly unpractical i quite agree with them but that is not the point here the point here is that a new school believes eugenics against ethics and it is proved by one familiar fact that the heroisms of history are actually the crimes of eugenics the eugenists books and articles are full of suggestions that non eugenic unions should and may come to be regarded as we regard sins that we should really feel that marrying an invalid is a kind of cruelty to children but history is full of the praises of people who have held sacred such ties to invalids of cases like those of colonel hutchinson and sir william temple who remained faithful to betrothals when beauty and health had been apparently blasted and though the illnesses of dorothy osborne and mrs hutchinson may not fall under the eugenic speculations i do not know it is obvious that they might have done so and certainly it would not have made any difference to men s moral opinion of the act i do not discuss here which morality i favour but i insist that they are opposite the eugenist really sets up as saints the very men whom hundreds of families have called sneaks to be consistent they ought to put up statues to the men who deserted their loves because of bodily misfortune with inscriptions celebrating the good eugenist who on his fianc e falling off a bicycle nobly refused to marry her or to the young hero who on hearing of an uncle with erysipelas magnanimously broke his word what is perfectly plain is this that mankind have hitherto held the bond between man and woman so sacred and the effect of it on the children so incalculable that they have always admired the maintenance of honour more than the maintenance of safety doubtless they thought that even the children might be none the worse for not being the children of cowards and shirkers but this was not the first thought the first commandment briefly we may say that while many moral systems have set restraints on sex almost as severe as any eugenist could set they have almost always had the character of securing the fidelity of the two sexes to each other and leaving the rest to god to introduce an ethic which makes that fidelity or infidelity vary with some calculation about heredity is that rarest of all t,4

personal care personal sympathy personal love the sweetest and rarest flowers must have their special atmosphere quite suddenly mr edward bultiwell laid down his times and glared across at jacob he was a large man with an ugly red face a neck which hung over his collar in rolls and a resonant voice directly he began to speak jacob began to shiver pratt he said am i to understand that the greeting which you offered to the occupants of this carriage when you entered was intended to include me i i certainly meant it to was the tremulous reply then let me beg that such a liberty be not repeated mr bultiwell continued brutally i look upon a man who has compounded with his creditors as a person temporarily at any rate outside the pale of converse with his fellows on er equal terms i look upon your presence in a first class carriage wearing a floral adornment mr bultiwell added with a jealous glance at the very beautiful rose which is to say the least of it conspicuous as er an impertinence to those who have had the misfortune to suffer from your insolvency the healthy colour faded from jacob s cheeks he had the air of one stricken by a lash dazed for the moment and bewildered my rose cost me nothing he faltered and my season ticket doesn t expire till next month i must go up to the city my help is needed with the books mr bultiwell shook his paper preparatory to disappearing behind it your presence here may be considered a matter of taste he fired off as a parting shot i call it damned bad taste mr jacob pratt sat like a hurt thing till the train stopped at the next station then he stumbled out on to the platform and making his way through an unaccountable mist he climbed somehow or other into a third class carriage richard dauncey the melancholy man who lived in the cottage opposite to his looked up at the newcomer s entrance and for the first time within his recollection jacob saw him smile good morning mr pratt the former said with a strenuous attempt at cordiality if you ll excuse my saying so that s the finest rose i ve ever seen in my life richard dauncey made his fortune by that speech and jacob had to swallow very hard and look very fixedly out of the window chapter i precisely two years later jacob pratt sat once more in his cottage sitting room contemplating the remains of a barely tasted breakfast before him read for the fiftieth time were the wonderful letters in his brain a most amazing confusion in his heart an almost hysterical joy presently mrs harris brought in his hat and stick you ll excuse my mentioning it

sometime during the day all right mrs harris shook her head at the sight of the untasted egg you ll excuse my saying so sir she pronounced severely but there s no good work done on an empty stomach times is hard as we all know but eggs is cheap mrs harris jacob reminded her it is two years since i left one of your eggs i left it then because i was miserable i am leaving it this morning because i have had good news i can t eat later on later on mrs harris and a bit of good news is what you deserve sir the latter declared lingering while he cut his accustomed rose with fingers which trembled strangely thank you very much mrs harris he said when i come back to night i ll tell you all about it once more then two years almost to a day after mr edward bultiwell of the great firm of bultiwell and sons had laid down his newspaper and spoken his mind jacob was on his way to the station again wearing a choice rose in his buttonhole he had found no occasion to change his lodgings for he had been an economical man who took great care of his possessions even in the days of his prosperity and his moderate salary as traveller for a bermondsey firm of merchants brought him in quite enough for his simple needs he had to some extent lived down his disgrace the manager of the international stores nodded to him now a trifle condescendingly yet with tacit acknowledgement of the fact that in domestic affairs jacob was a man of principle who always paid his way the greengrocer s wife passed the time of day when not too preoccupied and the newspaper boy no longer clutched for his penny jacob generally met the melancholy man at the corner of the avenue and walked to the station with him and he still grew roses and worshipped them on the way to the station on this particular morning he amazed his friend richard he said i shall not travel to the city with you to day at least i shall not start with you i shall change carriages at wendley as i did once before the devil richard exclaimed they were passing the plate glass window of a new emporium and jacob paused to glance furtively at his reflection he was an exceedingly neat man and his care for his clothes and person had survived two years of impecuniosity nevertheless although he passed muster well enough to the casual observer there were indications in his attire of the inevitable conflict between a desire for adornment and the lack of means to indulge it his too often pressed trousers were thin at the seams his linen thoug,4

willing to be his slave he listens with deep attention she explains that since her father s death she has been continuously persecuted by the village people on the double count of her italian blood and her poverty the girl invites him to come to her hut in the forest and verify what she says with a gesture he signifies that he will follow where she leads she rises the crowd gathers round all are

would change it indeed if he ever thought of such a calamity it was seasoned by the vague feeling that he could make her rich enough to purchase perhaps and extinguish the name of the fellow who married her why not since as it seemed women were equal to men nowadays and soames secretly convinced that they were not passed his curved hand over his face vigorously till it reached the comfort of his chin thanks to abstemious habits he had not grown fat and flabby his nose was pale and thin his grey moustache close clipped his eyesight unimpaired a slight stoop closened and corrected the expansion given to his face by the heightening of his forehead in the recession of his grey hair little change had time wrought in the warmest of the young forsytes as the last of the old forsytes timothy now in his hundred and first year would have phrased it the shade from the plane trees fell on his neat homburg hat he had given up top hats it was no use attracting attention to wealth in days like these plane trees his thoughts travelled sharply to madrid the easter before the war when having to make up his mind about that goya picture he had taken a voyage of discovery to study the painter on his spot the fellow had impressed him great range real genius highly as the chap ranked he would rank even higher before they had finished with him the second goya craze would be greater even than the first oh yes and he had bought on that visit he had as never before commissioned a copy of a fresco painting called la vendimia wherein was the figure of a girl with an arm akimbo who had reminded him of his daughter he had it now in the gallery at mapledurham and rather poor it was you couldn t copy goya he would still look at it however if his daughter were not there for the sake of something irresistibly reminiscent in the light erect balance of the figure the width between the arching eyebrows the eager dreaming of the dark eyes curious that fleur should have dark eyes when his own were grey no pure forsyte had brown eyes and her mother s blue but of course her grandmother lamotte s eyes were dark as treacle he began to walk on again towards hyde park corner no greater change in all england than in the row born almost within hail of it he could remember it from on brought there as a child between the crinolines to stare at tight trousered dandies in whiskers riding with a cavalry seat to watch the doffing of curly brimmed and white top hats the leisurely air of it all and the little bow legged man in a long red waistcoat who used to come among the fashion with dogs on several strings and try to sell one to his mother king charles spaniels italian greyhounds affectionate to her crinoline you never saw them now you saw no quality of any sort indeed just working people sitting in dull rows with nothing to stare at but a few young bouncing females in pot hats riding astride or desultory colonials charging up and down on dismal looking hacks with here and there little girls on ponies or old gentlemen jogging their livers or an orderly trying a great galumphing cavalry horse no thoroughbreds no grooms no bowing no scraping no gossip nothing only the trees the same the trees indifferent to the generations and declensions of mankind a democratic england dishevelled hurried noisy and seemingly without an apex and that something fastidious in the soul of soames turned over within him gone for ever the close borough of rank and polish wealth there was oh yes wealth he himself was a richer man than his father had ever been but manners flavour quality all gone engulfed in one vast ugly shoulder rubbing petrol smelling cheerio little half beaten pockets of gentility and caste lurking here and there dispersed and chetif as annette would say but nothing ever again firm and coherent to look up to and into this new hurly burly of bad manners and loose morals his daughter flower of his life was flung and when those labour chaps got power if they ever did the worst was yet to come he passed out under the archway at last no longer thank goodness disfigured by the gun grey of its search light they d better put a search light on to where they re all going he thought and light up their precious democracy and he directed his steps along the club fronts of piccadilly george forsyte of course would be sitting in the bay window of the iseeum the chap was so big now that he was there nearly all his time like some immovable sardonic humorous eye noting the decline of men and things and soames hurried ever constitutionally uneasy beneath his cousin s glance george who as he had heard had written a letter signed patriot in the middle of the war complaining of the government s hysteria in docking the oats of race horses yes there he was tall ponderous neat clean shaven with his smooth hair hardly thinned smelling no doubt of the best hair wash and a pink paper in his hand well he didn t change and for perhaps the first time in his life soames felt a kind of sympathy tapping in his waistcoat for that sardonic kinsman with his weight his perfectly parted hair and bull like gaze he was a guarantee that the old order would take some shifting yet he saw george move the pink paper as if inviting him to ascend the chap must want to ask something about his property it was still under soames s control for in the adoption of a sleeping partnership at that painful period twenty years back when he had divorced irene soames had found himself almost insensibly retaining control of all purely forsyte affairs

once have been a plateau of red rock from which the softer strata had eroded leaving the gentle league long slopes marked here and there by upstanding pillars and columns of singular shape and beauty i rode down the sweet scented sage slopes under the shadow of the lofty mittens and around and across the valley and back again to the height of land and when i had completed the ride a story had woven itself into my mind and the spot where i stood was to be the place where lin slone taught lucy bostil to ride the great stallion wildfire illustration there was something beyond the white peaked ranges two days ride took us across country to the segi with this wonderful canyon i was familiar that is as familiar as several visits could make a man with such a bewildering place in fact i had named it deception pass the segi had innumerable branches all more or less the same size and sometimes it was difficult to tell the main canyon from one of its tributaries the walls were rugged and crumbling of a red or yellow hue upward of a thousand feet in height and indented by spruce sided notches there were a number of ruined cliff dwellings the most accessible of which was keet seel i could imagine no more picturesque spot a huge wind worn cavern with a vast slanted stained wall held upon a projecting ledge or shelf the long line of cliff dwellings these silent little stone houses with their vacant black eye like windows had strange power to make me ponder and then dream next day upon resuming our journey it pleased me to try to find the trail to betatakin the most noted and surely the most wonderful and beautiful ruin in all the west in many places there was no trail at all and i encountered difficulties but in the end without much loss of time i entered the narrow rugged entrance of the canyon i had named surprise valley sight of the great dark cave thrilled me as i thought it might have thrilled bess and venters who had lived for me their imagined lives of loneliness here in this wild spot with the sight of those lofty walls and the scent of the dry sweet sage there rushed over me a strange feeling that riders of the purple sage was true my dream people of romance had really lived there once upon a time i climbed high upon the huge stones and along the smooth red walls where pay larkin once had glided with swift sure steps and i entered the musty cliff dwellings and called out to hear the weird and sonorous echoes and i wandered through the thickets and upon the grassy spruce shaded benches never for a moment free of the story i had conceived there something of awe and sadness abided with me i could not enter into the merry pranks and investigations of my party surprise valley seemed a part of my past my dreams my very self i left it haunted by its loneliness and silence and beauty by the story it had given me that night we camped at bubbling spring which once had been a geyser of considerable power wetherill told a story of an old navajo who had lived there for a long time according to the indian tale the old chief resided there without complaining of this geyser that was wont to inundate his fields but one season the unreliable waterspout made great and persistent endeavor to drown him and his people and horses whereupon the old navajo took his gun and shot repeatedly at the geyser and thundered aloud his anger to the great spirit the geyser ebbed away and from that day never burst forth again illustration weird and wonderful monuments in monument valley illustration sunset on the desert illustration cave of the cliff dwellers somewhere under the great bulge of navajo mountain i calculated that we were coming to the edge of the plateau the white bobbing pack horses disappeared and then our extra mustangs it is no unusual thing for a man to use three mounts on this trip then two of our indians disappeared but wetherill waited for us and so did nas ta bega the piute who first took wetherill down into nonnezoshe boco as i came up i thought we had indeed reached the end of the world it s down in there said wetherill with a laugh nas ta bega made a slow sweeping gesture there is always something so significant and impressive about an indian when he points anywhere it is as if he says there way beyond over the ranges is a place i know and it is far the fact was that i looked at the piute s dark inscrutable face before i looked out into the void my gaze then seemed impelled and held by things afar a vast yellow and purple corrugated world of distance apparently now on a level with my eyes i was drawn by the beauty and grandeur of that scene and then i was transfixed almost by fear by the realization that i dared to venture down into this wild and upflung fastness i kept looking afar sweeping the three quarter circle of horizon till my judgment of distance was confounded and my sense of proportion dwarfed one moment and magnified the next wetherill was pointing and explaining but i had not grasped all he said you can see two hundred miles into utah he went on that bright rough surface like a washboard is wind worn rock those little lines of cleavage are canyons there are a thousand canyons down there and only a few have we been in that long purple ragged line is the grand canyon of the colorado and there that blue fork in the red that s where the san juan comes in and there s escalante canyon i had to adopt the indian s method of studying unlimited spaces in the desert to look with slow contracted eyes from near to far the pack train and the drivers had begun to zigzag down a long slope bare of rock with scant strips of green and here and there a cedar half a mile down the slope merged in what seemed a green level but i knew it was not level this level was a

all sorts of people lie awake thinking of it i wish some of my damned committee would the doctor turned his eyes to the window i lie awake too he said and seemed to reflect but he was observing his patient acutely with his ears but you see how important it is said sir richmond and left his sentence unfinished i ll do what i can for you said the doctor and considered swiftly what line of talk he had best follow section this sense of a coming smash is epidemic said the doctor it s at the back of all sorts of mental trouble it is a new state of mind before the war it was abnormal a phase of neurasthenia now it is almost the normal state with whole classes of intelligent people intelligent i say the others always have been casual and adventurous and always will be a loss of confidence in the general background of life so that we seem to float over abysses we do said sir richmond and we have nothing but the old habits and ideas acquired in the days of our assurance there is a discord a jarring the doctor pursued his train of thought a new raw and dreadful sense of responsibility for the universe accompanied by a realization that the job is overwhelmingly too big for us we ve got to stand up to the job said sir richmond anyhow what else is there to do we may keep things together i ve got to do my bit and if only i could hold myself at it i could beat those fellows but that s where the devil of it comes in never have i been so desirous to work well in my life and never have i been so slack and weak willed and inaccurate sloppy indolent vicious the doctor was about to speak but sir richmond interrupted him what s got hold of me what s got hold of me i used to work well enough it s as if my will had come untwisted and was ravelling out into separate strands i ve lost my unity i m not a man but a mob i ve got to recover my vigour at any cost again as the doctor was about to speak the word was taken out of his mouth and what i think of it dr martineau is this it s fatigue it s mental and moral fatigue too much effort on too high a level and too austere one strains and fags flags flags i meant to say one strains and flags and then the lower stuff in one the subconscious stuff takes control there was a flavour of popularized psychoanalysis about this and the doctor drew in the corners of his mouth and gave his head a critical slant m m but this only made sir richmond raise his voice and quicken his speech i want he said a good tonic a pick me up a stimulating harmless drug of some sort that s indicated anyhow to begin with something to pull me together as people say bring me up to the scratch again i don t like the use of drugs said the doctor the expectation of sir richmond s expression changed to disappointment but that s not reasonable he cried that s not reasonable that s superstition call a thing a drug and condemn it everything is a drug everything that affects you food stimulates or tranquillizes drink noise is a stimulant and quiet an opiate what is life but response to stimulants or reaction after them when i m exhausted i want food when i m overactive and sleepless i want tranquillizing when i m dispersed i want pulling together but we don t know how to use drugs the doctor objected but you ought to know dr martineau fixed his eye on a first floor window sill on the opposite side of harley street his manner suggested a lecturer holding on to his theme a day will come when we shall be able to manipulate drugs all sorts of drugs and work them in to our general way of living i have no prejudice against them at all a time will come when we shall correct our moods get down to our reserves of energy by their help suspend fatigue put off sleep during long spells of exertion at some sudden crisis for example when we shall know enough to know just how far to go with this that or the other stuff and how to wash out its after effects i quite agree with you in principle but that time hasn t come yet decades of research yet if we tried that sort of thing now we should be like children playing with poisons and explosives it s out of the question i ve been taking a few little things already easton syrup for example strychnine it carries you for a time and drops you by the way has it done you any good any nett good it has i can see broken your sleep the doctor turned round again to his patient and looked up into his troubled face given physiological trouble i don t mind resorting to a drug given structural injury i don t mind surgery but except for any little mischief your amateur drugging may have done you do not seem to me to be either sick or injured you ve no trouble either of structure or material you are worried ill in your mind and otherwise perfectly sound it s the current of your thoughts fermenting if the trouble is in the mental sphere why go out of the mental sphere for a treatment talk and thought these are your remedies cool deliberate thought you re unravelled you say it yourself drugs will only make this or that unravelled strand behave disproportionately you don t want that you want to take stock of yourself as a whole find out where you stand but the fuel commission is it sitting now adjourned till after whitsuntide but there s heaps of work to be done still he added this is my one chance of any treatment the doctor made a little calculation three weeks it s scarcely time enough to begin you re certain that no regimen of carefully planned and chosen tonics dismiss the idea dismiss it he decided to take a plunge i ve just been thinking of,4

was seven years old large for his age a bold handsome lad with red hair mrs smith made a bargain with dick and led him back with her here panhandle took violent exception to having his pets killed or routed out by this boy he had never before seen he did not like his looks anyway but dick paid little heed to panhandle except once when mrs smith went into the house and then he knocked panhandle down for once panhandle did not squall he got up round eyed pale with his hands clenched he never said a word something was born in the depths of his gentle soul then dick tore a hole in the little wall of rocks that supported the porch and with a lighted torch on a stick he wormed his way in to rout out the skunks panhandle suddenly was thrilled and frightened by a bellowing from dick the boy came hurriedly backing out of the hole he fetched an odor with him that nearly suffocated panhandle so strange and raw and terrible was it dick s eyes were shut for the time being he had been blinded he bounced around like a chicken with its head cut off bawling wildly what had happened panhandle did not know but it certainly suited him goody goody he shouted holding his nose and edging away from the lad then panhandle saw smoke issuing from the hole under the porch the mother skunk and her kittens scampered out into the weeds he heard the crackle of flames that boy had dropped his torch under the porch screaming panhandle ran to alarm his mother but it was too late there were no men near at hand so nothing could be done panhandle stood crying beside his mother watching their little home burn to the ground somehow in his mind the boy dick had been to blame panhandle peered round to find him but he was gone never would panhandle forget that boy they walked to the uncle s house and spent the night there soon another home was under construction on the same site it was more of a shack than a house for building materials were scarce and the near approach of winter made hasty construction imperative winter came soon and panhandle and his mother were alone it was cold and they huddled over the little wood fire they had plenty to eat but were very uncomfortable in the one room shack bill smith came home but seldom that fall the valley had been overrun with homesteaders nesters they were called and these newcomers passed by often from the town drunk and rough panhandle used to lie awake a good deal during these lonely hours the moan of the prairie wind the mourn of wolves and yelp of coyotes became part of his existence he understood why his mother barred and blocked the one door placed the ax by the bed and the gun under her pillow even then he longed for the time when he would be old and big enough to protect her the lonely winter with its innumerable hours of solitude for mrs smith and the boy had incalculable influence upon his character she taught him much ways and things words and feelings that became an integral part of his life at last the long winter ended with spring came the gales of wind which though no longer cold were terrible in their violence many a night panhandle lay awake shrinking beside his mother fearing the shack would blow away over their heads many a day the sun was obscured and nothing could be cooked no work done while the dust storm raged as spring advanced with a lessening of the tornadoes a new and fascinating game came into panhandle s life it was to sit at the one little window and watch the cowboys ride by how he came to worship them they were on their way to the spring roundups his father had told him all about them panhandle would strain his eyes to get a first glimpse of them to count the shaggy prancing horses the lithe supple riders with their great sombreros their bright scarfs guns and chaps and boots and spurs their lassos how they fascinated panhandle ropes to whirl and throw at a running steer that was a game he resolved to play when he grew up and his mother discovering his interest made him a little reata and taught him how to throw it how to make loops and knots she told him how her people had owned horses thrown lassos run cattle panhandle was always watching for the cowboys when they passed by he would run to the other side of the shack where there was a knothole stuffed with a rag and through this he would peep until he was blinded by dust these were full days for the lad rousing in him wonder and awe eagerness and fear strange longings for he knew not what then one day his father brought home a black pony with three white feet and a white spot on his face panhandle was in rapture for him he could have burst for very joy but he could not speak it developed that his mother would not let him ride the pony except when she led it this roused as great a grief as possession was joy a beautiful little pony he could not ride ideas formed in his mind scintillated and grew into dark purpose one day he stole curly and led him out of sight behind the barn and mounting him rode down to the spring panhandle found himself alone he was free he was on the back of a horse mighty and incalculable fact curly felt the spirit of that occasion after drinking at the spring he broke into a lope panhandle stuck on somehow and turned the pony toward the house curly loped faster panhandle felt the wind in his hair he bounced up and down squealing with delight he twisted his hands in the flowing mane and held on at the top of the hill his joy became divided by fear curly kept on loping down the hill toward the house faster and faster panhandle bounced higher

once have been a plateau of red rock from which the softer strata had eroded leaving the gentle league long slopes marked here and there by upstanding pillars and columns of singular shape and beauty i rode down the sweet scented sage slopes under the shadow of the lofty mittens and around and across the valley and back again to the height of land and when i had completed the ride a story had woven itself into my mind and the spot where i stood was to be the place where lin slone taught lucy bostil to ride the great stallion wildfire illustration there was something beyond the white peaked ranges two days ride took us across country to the segi with this wonderful canyon i was familiar that is as familiar as several visits could make a man with such a bewildering place in fact i had named it deception pass the segi had innumerable branches all more or less the same size and sometimes it was difficult to tell the main canyon from one of its tributaries the walls were rugged and crumbling of a red or yellow hue upward of a thousand feet in height and indented by spruce sided notches there were a number of ruined cliff dwellings the most accessible of which was keet seel i could imagine no more picturesque spot a huge wind worn cavern with a vast slanted stained wall held upon a projecting ledge or shelf the long line of cliff dwellings these silent little stone houses with their vacant black eye like windows had strange power to make me ponder and then dream next day upon resuming our journey it pleased me to try to find the trail to betatakin the most noted and surely the most wonderful and beautiful ruin in all the west in many places there was no trail at all and i encountered difficulties but in the end without much loss of time i entered the narrow rugged entrance of the canyon i had named surprise valley sight of the great dark cave thrilled me as i thought it might have thrilled bess and venters who had lived for me their imagined lives of loneliness here in this wild spot with the sight of those lofty walls and the scent of the dry sweet sage there rushed over me a strange feeling that riders of the purple sage was true my dream people of romance had really lived there once upon a time i climbed high upon the huge stones and along the smooth red walls where pay larkin once had glided with swift sure steps and i entered the musty cliff dwellings and called out to hear the weird and sonorous echoes and i wandered through the thickets and upon the grassy spruce shaded benches never for a moment free of the story i had conceived there something of awe and sadness abided with me i could not enter into the merry pranks and investigations of my party surprise valley seemed a part of my past my dreams my very self i left it haunted by its loneliness and silence and beauty by the story it had given me that night we camped at bubbling spring which once had been a geyser of considerable power wetherill told a story of an old navajo who had lived there for a long time according to the indian tale the old chief resided there without complaining of this geyser that was wont to inundate his fields but one season the unreliable waterspout made great and persistent endeavor to drown him and his people and horses whereupon the old navajo took his gun and shot repeatedly at the geyser and thundered aloud his anger to the great spirit the geyser ebbed away and from that day never burst forth again illustration weird and wonderful monuments in monument valley illustration sunset on the desert illustration cave of the cliff dwellers somewhere under the great bulge of navajo mountain i calculated that we were coming to the edge of the plateau the white bobbing pack horses disappeared and then our extra mustangs it is no unusual thing for a man to use three mounts on this trip then two of our indians disappeared but wetherill waited for us and so did nas ta bega the piute who first took wetherill down into nonnezoshe boco as i came up i thought we had indeed reached the end of the world it s down in there said wetherill with a laugh nas ta bega made a slow sweeping gesture there is always something so significant and impressive about an indian when he points anywhere it is as if he says there way beyond over the ranges is a place i know and it is far the fact was that i looked at the piute s dark inscrutable face before i looked out into the void my gaze then seemed impelled and held by things afar a vast yellow and purple corrugated world of distance apparently now on a level with my eyes i was drawn by the beauty and grandeur of that scene and then i was transfixed almost by fear by the realization that i dared to venture down into this wild and upflung fastness i kept looking afar sweeping the three quarter circle of horizon till my judgment of distance was confounded and my sense of proportion dwarfed one moment and magnified the next wetherill was pointing and explaining but i had not grasped all he said you can see two hundred miles into utah he went on that bright rough surface like a washboard is wind worn rock those little lines of cleavage are canyons there are a thousand canyons down there and only a few have we been in that long purple ragged line is the grand canyon of the colorado and there that blue fork in the red that s where the san juan comes in and there s escalante canyon i had to adopt the indian s method of studying unlimited spaces in the desert to look with slow contracted eyes from near to far the pack train and the drivers had begun to zigzag down a long slope bare of rock with scant strips of green and here and there a cedar half a mile down the slope merged in what seemed a green level but i knew it was not level this level was a

was seven years old large for his age a bold handsome lad with red hair mrs smith made a bargain with dick and led him back with her here panhandle took violent exception to having his pets killed or routed out by this boy he had never before seen he did not like his looks anyway but dick paid little heed to panhandle except once when mrs smith went into the house and then he knocked panhandle down for once panhandle did not squall he got up round eyed pale with his hands clenched he never said a word something was born in the depths of his gentle soul then dick tore a hole in the little wall of rocks that supported the porch and with a lighted torch on a stick he wormed his way in to rout out the skunks panhandle suddenly was thrilled and frightened by a bellowing from dick the boy came hurriedly backing out of the hole he fetched an odor with him that nearly suffocated panhandle so strange and raw and terrible was it dick s eyes were shut for the time being he had been blinded he bounced around like a chicken with its head cut off bawling wildly what had happened panhandle did not know but it certainly suited him goody goody he shouted holding his nose and edging away from the lad then panhandle saw smoke issuing from the hole under the porch the mother skunk and her kittens scampered out into the weeds he heard the crackle of flames that boy had dropped his torch under the porch screaming panhandle ran to alarm his mother but it was too late there were no men near at hand so nothing could be done panhandle stood crying beside his mother watching their little home burn to the ground somehow in his mind the boy dick had been to blame panhandle peered round to find him but he was gone never would panhandle forget that boy they walked to the uncle s house and spent the night there soon another home was under construction on the same site it was more of a shack than a house for building materials were scarce and the near approach of winter made hasty construction imperative winter came soon and panhandle and his mother were alone it was cold and they huddled over the little wood fire they had plenty to eat but were very uncomfortable in the one room shack bill smith came home but seldom that fall the valley had been overrun with homesteaders nesters they were called and these newcomers passed by often from the town drunk and rough panhandle used to lie awake a good deal during these lonely hours the moan of the prairie wind the mourn of wolves and yelp of coyotes became part of his existence he understood why his mother barred and blocked the one door placed the ax by the bed and the gun under her pillow even then he longed for the time when he would be old and big enough to protect her the lonely winter with its innumerable hours of solitude for mrs smith and the boy had incalculable influence upon his character she taught him much ways and things words and feelings that became an integral part of his life at last the long winter ended with spring came the gales of wind which though no longer cold were terrible in their violence many a night panhandle lay awake shrinking beside his mother fearing the shack would blow away over their heads many a day the sun was obscured and nothing could be cooked no work done while the dust storm raged as spring advanced with a lessening of the tornadoes a new and fascinating game came into panhandle s life it was to sit at the one little window and watch the cowboys ride by how he came to worship them they were on their way to the spring roundups his father had told him all about them panhandle would strain his eyes to get a first glimpse of them to count the shaggy prancing horses the lithe supple riders with their great sombreros their bright scarfs guns and chaps and boots and spurs their lassos how they fascinated panhandle ropes to whirl and throw at a running steer that was a game he resolved to play when he grew up and his mother discovering his interest made him a little reata and taught him how to throw it how to make loops and knots she told him how her people had owned horses thrown lassos run cattle panhandle was always watching for the cowboys when they passed by he would run to the other side of the shack where there was a knothole stuffed with a rag and through this he would peep until he was blinded by dust these were full days for the lad rousing in him wonder and awe eagerness and fear strange longings for he knew not what then one day his father brought home a black pony with three white feet and a white spot on his face panhandle was in rapture for him he could have burst for very joy but he could not speak it developed that his mother would not let him ride the pony except when she led it this roused as great a grief as possession was joy a beautiful little pony he could not ride ideas formed in his mind scintillated and grew into dark purpose one day he stole curly and led him out of sight behind the barn and mounting him rode down to the spring panhandle found himself alone he was free he was on the back of a horse mighty and incalculable fact curly felt the spirit of that occasion after drinking at the spring he broke into a lope panhandle stuck on somehow and turned the pony toward the house curly loped faster panhandle felt the wind in his hair he bounced up and down squealing with delight he twisted his hands in the flowing mane and held on at the top of the hill his joy became divided by fear curly kept on loping down the hill toward the house faster and faster panhandle bounced higher and higher up on his neck back on his haunches until suddenly his hold broke and he was thrown down,4

resemblance to an owl perched upon the edge of its nest hole he was busily engaged in doing nothing and in staring into nothingness as according to tom was his habit when communing with what he tom called his dratted speerits customer said tom in a harsh voice sorry to disturb you at your prayers guv nor but not having two pair of hands i can t serve a crowd meaning the old woman of the undergarments and myself mr potts slid off his stool and prepared for action when he saw however who the customer was he bristled that is the only word for it the truth is that although between us there was an inward and spiritual sympathy there was also an outward and visible hostility twice i had outbid mr potts at a local auction for articles which he desired moreover after the fashion of every good collector he felt it to be his duty to hate me as another collector lastly several times i had offered him smaller sums for antiques upon which he set a certain monetary value it is true that long ago i had given up this bargaining for the reason that mr potts would never take less than he asked indeed he followed the example of the vendor of the sibylline books in ancient rome he did not destroy the goods indeed after the fashion of that person and demand the price of all of them for the one that remained but invariably he put up his figure by per cent and nothing would induce him to take off one farthing what do you want sir he said grumpily vests hose collars or socks oh socks i think i replied at hazard thinking that they would be easiest to carry whereupon mr potts produced some peculiarly objectionable and shapeless woollen articles which he almost threw at me saying that they were all he had in stock now i detest woollen socks and never wear them still i made a purchase thinking with sympathy of my old gardener whose feet they would soon be scratching and while the parcel was being tied up said in an insinuating voice anything fresh upstairs mr potts no sir he answered shortly at least not much and if there were what s the use of showing them to you after the business about that clock it was you wanted for it mr potts i asked no sir it was and now it s per cent on to that you can work out the sum for yourself well let s have another look at it mr potts i replied humbly whereon with a grunt and a muttered injunction to tom to mind the shop he led the way upstairs now the house in which mr potts dwelt had once been of considerable pretensions and was very very old elizabethan i should think although it had been refronted with a horrible stucco to suit modern tastes the oak staircase was good though narrow and led to numerous small rooms upon two floors above some of which rooms were panelled and had oak beams now whitewashed like the panelling at least they had once been whitewashed probably in the last generation these rooms were literally crammed with every sort of old furniture most of it decrepit though for many of the articles dealers would have given a good price but at dealers mr potts drew the line not one of them had ever set a foot upon that oaken stair to the attics the place was filled with this furniture and other articles such as books china samplers with the glass broken and i know not what besides piled in heaps upon the floor indeed where mr potts slept was a mystery either it must have been under the counter in his shop or perhaps at nights he inhabited a worm eaten jacobean bedstead which stood in an attic for i observed a kind of pathway to it running through a number of legless chairs also some dirty blankets between the moth riddled curtains not far from this bedstead propped in an intoxicated way against the sloping wall of the old house stood the clock which i desired it was one of the first regulator clocks with a wooden pendulum used by the maker himself to check the time keeping of all his other clocks and enclosed in a chaste and perfect mahogany case of the very best style of its period so beautiful was it indeed that it had been an instance of love at first sight between us and although there was an estrangement on the matter of settlements or in other words over the question of price now i felt that never more could that clock and i be parted so i agreed to give old potts the or to be accurate s which he asked on the per cent rise principle thankful in my heart that he had not made it more and prepared to go as i turned however my eye fell upon a large chest of the almost indestructible yellow cypress wood of which were made it is said the doors of st peter s at rome that stood for eight hundred years and for aught i know are still standing as good as on the day when they were put up marriage coffer said potts answering my unspoken question italian about i suggested may be so or perhaps dutch made by italian artists but older than that for somebody has burnt on the lid with a hot iron not for sale not for sale at all much too good to sell just you look inside it the old key is tied to the spring lock never saw such poker work in my life gods and goddesses and i don t know what and venus sitting in the middle in a wreath of flowers with nothing on and holding

humiliation jacob felt a little thrill of triumph at the thought of mr bultiwell s three gardeners it took more than gardeners to grow such a rose as he was wearing he liked to fancy that it took personal care personal sympathy personal love the sweetest and rarest flowers must have their special atmosphere quite suddenly mr edward bultiwell laid down his times and glared across at jacob he was a large man with an ugly red face a neck which hung over his collar in rolls and a resonant voice directly he began to speak jacob began to shiver pratt he said am i to understand that the greeting which you offered to the occupants of this carriage when you entered was intended to include me i i certainly meant it to was the tremulous reply then let me beg that such a liberty be not repeated mr bultiwell continued brutally i look upon a man who has compounded with his creditors as a person temporarily at any rate outside the pale of converse with his fellows on er equal terms i look upon your presence in a first class carriage wearing a floral adornment mr bultiwell added with a jealous glance at the very beautiful rose which is to say the least of it conspicuous as er an impertinence to those who have had the misfortune to suffer from your insolvency the healthy colour faded from jacob s cheeks he had the air of one stricken by a lash dazed for the moment and bewildered my rose cost me nothing he faltered and my season ticket doesn t expire till next month i must go up to the city my help is needed with the books mr bultiwell shook his paper preparatory to disappearing behind it your presence here may be considered a matter of taste he fired off as a parting shot i call it damned bad taste mr jacob pratt sat like a hurt thing till the train stopped at the next station then he stumbled out on to the platform and making his way through an unaccountable mist he climbed somehow or other into a third class carriage richard dauncey the melancholy man who lived in the cottage opposite to his looked up at the newcomer s entrance and for the first time within his recollection jacob saw him smile good morning mr pratt the former said with a strenuous attempt at cordiality if you ll excuse my saying so that s the finest rose i ve ever seen in my life richard dauncey made his fortune by that speech and jacob had to swallow very hard and look very fixedly out of the window chapter i precisely two years later jacob pratt sat once more in his cottage sitting room contemplating the remains of a barely tasted breakfast before him read for the fiftieth time were the wonderful letters in his brain a most amazing confusion in his heart an almost hysterical joy presently mrs harris brought in his hat and stick you ll excuse my mentioning it sir she said looking at the former a little disparagingly but brush though i may there s no doing much with this hat of yours the nap s fair gone maybe you haven t noticed it sir but with the summer coming on a straw hat i ll buy a straw hat to day mrs harris jacob promised and you ll be home at the usual time for your supper sir i i expect so i am not quite sure mrs harris i shall be home sometime during the day all right mrs harris shook her head at the sight of the untasted egg you ll excuse my saying so sir she pronounced severely but there s no good work done on an empty stomach times is hard as we all know but eggs is cheap mrs harris jacob reminded her it is two years since i left one of your eggs i left it then because i was miserable i am leaving it this morning because i have had good news i can t eat later on later on mrs harris and a bit of good news is what you deserve sir the latter declared lingering while he cut his accustomed rose with fingers which trembled strangely thank you very much mrs harris he said when i come back to night i ll tell you all about it once more then two years almost to a day after mr edward bultiwell of the great firm of bultiwell and sons had laid down his newspaper and spoken his mind jacob was on his way to the station again wearing a choice rose in his buttonhole he had found no occasion to change his lodgings for he had been an economical man who took great care of his possessions even in the days of his prosperity and his moderate salary as traveller for a bermondsey firm of merchants brought him in quite enough for his simple needs he had to some extent lived down his disgrace the manager of the international stores nodded to him now a trifle condescendingly yet with tacit acknowledgement of the fact that in domestic affairs jacob was a man of principle who always paid his way the greengrocer s wife passed the time of day when not too preoccupied and the newspaper boy no longer clutched for his penny jacob generally met the melancholy man at the corner of the avenue and walked to the station with him and he still grew roses and worshipped them on the way to the station on this particular morning he amazed his friend richard he said i shall not travel to the city with you to day at least i shall not start with you i shall change carriages at wendley as i did once before the devil richard exclaimed they were passing the plate glass window of a new emporium and jacob paused to glance furtively at his reflection he was an exceedingly neat man and his care for his clothes and person had survived two years of impecuniosity nevertheless although he passed muster well enough to the casual observer there were indications in his attire of the inevitable conflict between a desire for adornment and the lack of means to indulge it his too often pressed trousers were thin at the seams his linen thoug,4

all sorts of people lie awake thinking of it i wish some of my damned committee would the doctor turned his eyes to the window i lie awake too he said and seemed to reflect but he was observing his patient acutely with his ears but you see how important it is said sir richmond and left his sentence unfinished i ll do what i can for you said the doctor and considered swiftly what line of talk he had best follow section this sense of a coming smash is epidemic said the doctor it s at the back of all sorts of mental trouble it is a new state of mind before the war it was abnormal a phase of neurasthenia now it is almost the normal state with whole classes of intelligent people intelligent i say the others always have been casual and adventurous and always will be a loss of confidence in the general background of life so that we seem to float over abysses we do said sir richmond and we have nothing but the old habits and ideas acquired in the days of our assurance there is a discord a jarring the doctor pursued his train of thought a new raw and dreadful sense of responsibility for the universe accompanied by a realization that the job is overwhelmingly too big for us we ve got to stand up to the job said sir richmond anyhow what else is there to do we may keep things together i ve got to do my bit and if only i could hold myself at it i could beat those fellows but that s where the devil of it comes in never have i been so desirous to work well in my life and never have i been so slack and weak willed and inaccurate sloppy indolent vicious the doctor was about to speak but sir richmond interrupted him what s got hold of me what s got hold of me i used to work well enough it s as if my will had come untwisted and was ravelling out into separate strands i ve lost my unity i m not a man but a mob i ve got to recover my vigour at any cost again as the doctor was about to speak the word was taken out of his mouth and what i think of it dr martineau is this it s fatigue it s mental and moral fatigue too much effort on too high a level and too austere one strains and fags flags flags i meant to say one strains and flags and then the lower stuff in one the subconscious stuff takes control there was a flavour of popularized psychoanalysis about this and the doctor drew in the corners of his mouth and gave his head a critical slant m m but this only made sir richmond raise his voice and quicken his speech i want he said a good tonic a pick me up a stimulating harmless drug of some sort that s indicated anyhow to begin with something to pull me together as people say bring me up to the scratch again i don t like the use of drugs said the doctor the expectation of sir richmond s expression changed to disappointment but that s not reasonable he cried that s not reasonable that s superstition call a thing a drug and condemn it everything is a drug everything that affects you food stimulates or tranquillizes drink noise is a stimulant and quiet an opiate what is life but response to stimulants or reaction after them when i m exhausted i want food when i m overactive and sleepless i want tranquillizing when i m dispersed i want pulling together but we don t know how to use drugs the doctor objected but you ought to know dr martineau fixed his eye on a first floor window sill on the opposite side of harley street his manner suggested a lecturer holding on to his theme a day will come when we shall be able to manipulate drugs all sorts of drugs and work them in to our general way of living i have no prejudice against them at all a time will come when we shall correct our moods get down to our reserves of energy by their help suspend fatigue put off sleep during long spells of exertion at some sudden crisis for example when we shall know enough to know just how far to go with this that or the other stuff and how to wash out its after effects i quite agree with you in principle but that time hasn t come yet decades of research yet if we tried that sort of thing now we should be like children playing with poisons and explosives it s out of the question i ve been taking a few little things already easton syrup for example strychnine it carries you for a time and drops you by the way has it done you any good any nett good it has i can see broken your sleep the doctor turned round again to his patient and looked up into his troubled face given physiological trouble i don t mind resorting to a drug given structural injury i don t mind surgery but except for any little mischief your amateur drugging may have done you do not seem to me to be either sick or injured you ve no trouble either of structure or material you are worried ill in your mind and otherwise perfectly sound it s the current of your

yourself drugs will only make this or that unravelled strand behave disproportionately you don t want that you want to take stock of yourself as a whole find out where you stand but the fuel commission is it sitting now adjourned till after whitsuntide but there s heaps of work to be done still he added this is my one chance of any treatment the doctor made a little calculation three

desolation which i shall never forget are for the most part unutterably bad of course we cried out that shakespeare wrote books and milton and shelley oh yes she interrupted us you ve been well taught i can see but you are not members of the london library here her sobs broke forth anew at length recovering a little she opened one of the pile of books which she always carried about with her from a window or in a garden or some such name as that it was called and it was written by a man called benton or henson or something of that kind she read the first few pages we listened in silence but that s not a book someone said so she chose another this time it was a history but i have forgotten the writer s name our trepidation increased as she went on not a word of it seemed to be true and the style in which it was written was execrable poetry poetry we cried impatiently read us poetry i cannot describe the desolation which fell upon us as she opened a little volume and mouthed out the verbose sentimental foolery which it contained it must have been written by a woman one of us urged but no she told us that it was written by a young man one of the most famous poets of the day i leave you to imagine what the shock of the discovery was though we all cried and begged her to read no more she persisted and read us extracts from the lives of the lord chancellors when she had finished jane the eldest and wisest of us rose to her feet and said that she for one was not convinced why she asked if men write such rubbish as this should our mothers have wasted their youth in bringing them into the world we were all silent and in the silence poor poll could be heard sobbing out why why did my father teach me to read clorinda was the first to come to her senses it s all our fault she said every one of us knows how to read but no one save poll has ever taken the trouble to do it i for one have taken it for granted that it was a woman s duty to spend her youth in bearing children i venerated my mother for bearing ten still more my grandmother for bearing fifteen it was i confess my own ambition to bear twenty we have gone on all these ages supposing that men were equally industrious and that their works were of equal merit while we have borne the children they we supposed have borne the books and the pictures we have populated the world they have civilized it but now that we can read what prevents us from judging the results before we bring another child into the world we must swear that we will find out what the world is like so we made ourselves into a society for asking questions one of us was to visit a man of war another was to hide herself in a scholar s study another was to attend a meeting of business men while all were to read books look at pictures go to concerts keep our eyes open in the streets and ask questions perpetually we were very young you can judge of our simplicity when i tell you that before parting that night we agreed that the objects of life were to produce good people and good books our questions were to be directed to finding out how far these objects were now attained by men we vowed solemnly that we would not bear a single child until we were satisfied off we went then some to the british museum others to the king s navy some to oxford others to cambridge we visited the royal academy and the tate heard modern music in concert rooms went to the law courts and saw new plays no one dined out without asking her partner certain questions and carefully noting his replies at intervals we met together and compared our observations oh those were merry meetings never have i laughed so much as i did when rose read her notes upon honour and described how she had dressed herself as an x thiopian prince and gone aboard one of his majesty s ships discovering the hoax the captain visited her now disguised as a private gentleman and demanded that honour should be satisfied but how she asked how he bellowed with the cane of course seeing that he was beside himself with rage and expecting that her last moment had come she bent over and received to her amazement six light taps upon the behind the honour of the british navy is avenged he cried and raising herself she saw him with the sweat pouring down his face holding out a trembling right hand away she exclaimed striking an attitude and imitating the ferocity of his own expression my honour has still to be satisfied spoken like a gentleman he returned and fell into profound thought if six strokes avenge the honour of the king s navy he mused how many avenge the honour of a private gentleman he said he would prefer to lay the case before his brother officers she replied haughtily that she could not wait he praised her sensibility let me see he

from the four staircases that lead up to the platform men women and children all in gala attire the young people conversing gesticulating smiling the older people more subdued carry beads and votive offering to buddha charming burmese girls with huge cigars meet and greet handsome burmese men smoking cheroots and wearing flowers in their ears children play silently with coloured balls in the

king is seen the girl throws herself oriental fashion in his path her beauty and her pathos arrest his attention and he waves aside those who would interfere she implores the king s protection she is willing to be his slave he listens with deep attention she explains that since her father s death she has been continuously persecuted by the village people on the double count of her italian blood and her poverty the girl invites him to come to her hut in the forest and verify what she says with a gesture he signifies that he will follow where she leads she rises the crowd gathers round all are

trees its trackless paths its indescribable silence the curtain discovers mah phru and the king who expresses his amazement at the loneliness and the poverty of her lot she explains that poverty is not what frightens her but the enmity of those who live yonder and who make it almost impossible for her to sell her cucumbers or her pineapples the king s gaze never leaves the face or figure of the girl he declares that he will protect her that he will build her a home here in the shadow of the loneliness around them he has two years of an unfettered freedom for those years he can command his

having received a good many knocks at home he kept the hard head out of sight and played at poetry and romance with his literary wife and his sturdy passionate girls he was a man of courage not given to complaining bearing his burdens by himself no he did not let the world intrude far into his home he had a delicate sensitive wife whose poetry won some fame in the narrow world of letters he himself with his tough old barbarian fighting spirit had an almost child like delight in verse in sweet poetry and in the delightful game of a cultured home his blood was strong even to coarseness but that only made the home more vigorous more robust and christmassy there was always a touch of christmas about him now he was well off if there was poetry after dinner there were also chocolates and nuts and good little out of the way things to be munching well then into this family came egbert he was made of quite a different paste the girls and the father were strong limbed thick blooded people true english as holly trees and hawthorn are english their culture was grafted on to them as one might perhaps graft a common pink rose on to a thornstem it flowered oddly enough but it did not alter their blood and egbert was a born rose the age long breeding had left him with a delightful spontaneous passion he was not clever nor even literary no but the intonation of his voice and the movement of his supple handsome body and the fine texture of his flesh and his hair the slight arch of his nose the quickness of his blue eyes would easily take the place of poetry winifred loved him loved him this southerner as a higher being a higher being mind you not a deeper and as for him he loved her in passion with every fibre of him she was the very warm stuff of life to him wonderful then those days at crockham cottage the first days all alone save for the woman who came to work in the mornings marvellous days when she had all his tall supple fine fleshed youth to herself for herself and he had her like a ruddy fire into which he could cast himself for rejuvenation ah that it might never end this passion this marriage the flame of their two bodies burnt again into that old cottage that was haunted already by so much by gone physical desire you could not be in the dark room for an hour without the influences coming over you the hot blood desire of by gone yeomen there in this old den where they had lusted and bred for so many generations the silent house dark with thick timbered walls and the big black chimney place and the sense of secrecy dark with low little windows sunk into the earth dark like a lair where strong beasts had lurked and mated lonely at night and lonely by day left to themselves and their own intensity for so many generations it seemed to cast a spell on the two young people they became different there was a curious secret glow about them a certain slumbering flame hard to understand that enveloped them both they too felt that they did not belong to the london world any more crockham had changed their blood the sense of the snakes that lived and slept even in their own garden in the sun so that he going forward with the spade would see a curious coiled brownish pile on the black soil which suddenly would start up hiss and dazzle rapidly away hissing one day winifred heard the strangest scream from the flower bed under the low window of the living room ah the strangest scream like the very soul of the dark past crying aloud she ran out and saw a long brown snake on the flower bed and in its flat mouth the one hind leg of a frog was striving to escape and screaming its strange tiny bellowing scream she looked at the snake and from its sullen flat head it looked at her obstinately she gave a cry and it released the frog and slid angrily away that was crockham the spear of modern invention had not passed through it and it lay there secret primitive savage as when the saxons first came and egbert and she were caught there caught out of the world he was not idle nor was she there were plenty of things to be done the house to be put into final repair after the workmen had gone cushions and curtains to sew the paths to make the water to fetch and attend to and then the slope of the deep soiled neglected garden to level to terrace with little terraces and paths and to fill with flowers he worked away in his shirt sleeves worked all day intermittently doing this thing and the other and she quiet and rich in herself seeing him stooping and labouring away by himself would come to help him to be near him he of course was an amateur a born amateur he worked so hard and did so little and nothing he ever did would hold together for long if he terraced the garden he held up the earth with a couple of long narrow planks that soon began to bend with the pressure from behind and would not need many years to rot through and break and let the soil slither all down again in a heap towards the stream bed but there you are he had not been brought up to come to grips with anything and he thought it would do nay he did not think there was anything else except little temporary contrivances possible he who had such a passion for his old enduring cottage and for the old enduring things of the bygone england curious that the sense of permanency in the past had such a hold over him whilst in the present he was all amateurish and sketchy winifred could not criticize him town bred everything seemed to her splendid and the very digging and shovelling itself seemed romantic but neither egbert nor she yet

would change it indeed if he ever thought of such a calamity it was seasoned by the vague feeling that he could make her rich enough to purchase perhaps and extinguish the name of the fellow who married her why not since as it seemed women were equal to men nowadays and soames secretly convinced that they were not passed his curved hand over his face vigorously till it reached the comfort of his chin thanks to abstemious habits he had not grown fat and flabby his nose was pale and thin his grey moustache close clipped his eyesight unimpaired a slight stoop closened and corrected the

days like these plane trees his thoughts travelled sharply to madrid the easter before the war when having to make up his mind about that goya picture he had taken a voyage of discovery to study the painter on his spot the fellow had impressed him great range real genius highly as the chap ranked he would rank even higher before they had finished with him the second goya craze would be greater even than the first oh yes and he had bought on that visit he had as never before commissioned a copy of a fresco painting called la vendimia wherein was the figure of a girl with an arm akimbo who had reminded him of his daughter he had it now in the gallery at mapledurham and rather poor it was you couldn t copy goya he would still look at it however if his daughter were not there for the sake of something irresistibly reminiscent in the light erect balance of the figure the width between the arching eyebrows the eager dreaming of the dark eyes curious that fleur should have dark eyes when his own were grey no pure forsyte had brown eyes and her mother s blue but of course her grandmother lamotte s eyes were dark as treacle he began to walk on again towards hyde park corner no greater change in all england than in the row born almost within hail of it he could remember it from on brought there as a child between the crinolines to stare at tight trousered dandies in whiskers riding with a cavalry seat to watch the doffing of curly brimmed and white top hats the leisurely air of it all and the little bow legged man in a long red waistcoat who used to come among the fashion with dogs on several strings and try to sell one to his mother king charles spaniels italian greyhounds affectionate to her crinoline you never saw them now you saw no quality of any sort indeed just working people sitting in dull rows with nothing to stare at but a few young bouncing females in pot hats riding astride or desultory colonials charging up and down on dismal looking hacks with here and there little girls on ponies or old gentlemen jogging their livers or an orderly trying a great galumphing cavalry horse no thoroughbreds no grooms no bowing no scraping no gossip nothing only the trees the same the trees indifferent to the generations and declensions of mankind a democratic england dishevelled hurried noisy and seemingly without an apex and that something fastidious in the soul of soames turned over within him gone for ever the close borough of rank and polish wealth there was oh yes wealth he himself was a richer man than his father had ever been but manners flavour quality all gone engulfed in one vast ugly shoulder rubbing petrol smelling cheerio little half beaten pockets of gentility and caste lurking here and there dispersed and chetif as annette would say but nothing ever again firm and coherent to look up to and into this new hurly burly of bad manners and loose morals his daughter flower of his life was flung and when those labour chaps got power if they ever did the worst was yet to come he passed out under the archway at last no longer thank goodness disfigured by the gun grey of its search light they d better put a search light on to where they re all going he thought and light up their precious democracy and he directed his steps along the club fronts of piccadilly george forsyte of course would be sitting in the bay window of the

beneath his cousin s glance george who as he had heard had written a letter signed patriot in the middle of the war complaining of the government s hysteria in docking the oats of race horses yes there he was tall ponderous neat clean shaven with his smooth hair hardly thinned smelling no doubt of the best hair wash and a pink paper in his hand well he didn t change and for perhaps the first time in his life soames felt a kind of sympathy tapping in his waistcoat for that sardonic kinsman with his weight his perfectly parted hair and bull like gaze he was a guarantee that the old order would take some shifting yet he saw george move the pink paper as if inviting him to ascend the chap must want to ask something about his property it was still under soames s control for in the adoption of a sleeping partnership at that painful period twenty years back when he had divorced irene soames had found himself almost insensibly retaining control of all purely forsyte affairs

distinctively social aspects of london the general artlessly histrionised air of things caused so many examples to spring from behind any hedge what came up however at once for my own stretched canvas was that it would have to be ample give me really space to turn round and that a single illustrative case might easily be meagre fare the young man who should chuck admired politics and of course some other admired object with them would be all very well but he wouldn t be enough therefore what should one say to some other young man who would chuck something and somebody else admired in their way too there need never at the worst be any difficulty about the things advantageously chuckable for art the question is all but of choosing them in the heap yet were i to represent a struggle an interesting one indispensably with the passions of the theatre as a profession or at least as an absorption i should have to place the theatre in another light than the satiric this however would by good luck be perfectly possible too without a sacrifice of truth and i should doubtless even be able to make my theatric case as important as i might desire it it seemed clear that i needed big cases small ones would practically give my central idea away and i make out now my still labouring under the illusion that the case of the sacrifice for art can ever be with truth with taste with discretion involved apparently and showily big i daresay it glimmered upon me even then that the very sharpest difficulty of the victim of the conflict i should seek to represent and the very highest interest of his predicament dwell deep in the fact that his repudiation of the great obvious great moral or functional or useful character shall just have to consent to resemble a surrender for absolutely nothing those characters are all large and expansive seated and established and endowed whereas the most charming truth about the preference for art is that to parade abroad so thoroughly inward and so naturally embarrassed a matter is to falsify and vulgarise it that as a preference attended with the honours of publicity it is indeed nowhere that in fact under the rule of its sincerity its only honours are those of contradiction concentration and a seemingly deplorable indifference to everything but itself nothing can well figure as less big in an honest thesis than a marked instance of somebody s willingness to pass mainly for an ass of these things i must i say have been in strictness aware what i perhaps failed of was to note that if a certain romantic glamour even that of mere eccentricity or of a fine perversity may be flung over the act of exchange of a career for the esthetic life in general the prose and the modesty of the matter yet come in with any exhibition of the particular branch of esthetics selected then it is that the attitude of hero or heroine may look too much for the romantic effect like a low crouching over proved trifles art indeed has in our day taken on so many honours and emoluments that the recognition of its importance is more than a custom has become on occasion almost a fury the line is drawn especially in the english world only at the importance of heeding what it may mean the more i turn my pieces over at any rate the more i now see i must have found in them and i remember how once well in presence of my three typical examples my fear of too ample a canvas quite dropped the only question was that if i had marked my political case from so far back for a story by itself and then marked my theatrical case for another the joining together of these interests originally seen as separate might all disgracefully betray the seam show for mechanical and superficial a story was a story a picture a picture and i had a mortal horror of two stories two pictures in one the reason of this was the clearest my subject was immediately under that disadvantage so cheated of its indispensable centre as to become of no more use for expressing a main intention than a wheel without a hub is of use for moving a cart it was a fact apparently that one had on occasion seen two pictures in one were there not for instance certain sublime tintorettos at venice a measureless crucifixion in especial which showed without loss of authority half a dozen actions separately taking place yes that might be but there had surely been nevertheless a mighty pictorial fusion so that the virtue of composition had somehow thereby come all mysteriously to its own of course the affair would be simple enough if composition could be kept out of the question yet by what art or process what bars and bolts what unmuzzled dogs and pointed guns perform that feat i had to know myself utterly inapt for any such valour and recognise that to make it possible sundry things should have begun for me much further back than i had felt them even in their dawn a picture without composition slights its most precious chance for beauty and is moreover not composed at all unless the painter knows how that principle of health and safety working as an absolutely premeditated art has prevailed there may in its absence be life incontestably as the newcomes has life as les trois mousquetaires as tolstoi s peace and war have it but what do such large loose baggy monsters with their queer elements of the accidental and the arbitrary artistically mean we have heard it maintained we well remember that such things are superior to art but we understand least of all what that may mean and we look in vain for the artist the divine explanatory genius who will come to our aid and tell us there is life and life and as waste is only life sacrificed and thereby prevented from counting i delight in a deep breathing economy and an orga,4

asiatic land mass the vast ural mountain range toward the military designs labs sherikov met him at the entrance look here reinhart don t think you re going to order me around i m not going to take it easy reinhart fell into step beside the bigger man they passed through the check and into the auxiliary labs no immediate coercion will be exerted over you or your staff you re free to continue your work as you see fit for the present let s get this straight my concern is to integrate your work with our total social needs as long as your work is sufficiently productive reinhart stopped in his tracks pretty isn t he sherikov said ironically what the hell is it icarus we call him remember the greek myth the legend of icarus icarus flew this icarus is going to fly one of these days sherikov shrugged you can examine him if you want i suppose this is what you came here to see reinhart advanced slowly this is the weapon you ve been working on how does he look rising up in the center of the chamber was a squat metal cylinder a great ugly cone of dark gray technicians circled around it wiring up the exposed relay banks reinhart caught a glimpse of endless tubes and filaments a maze of wires and terminals and parts criss crossing each other layer on layer what is it reinhart perched on the edge of a workbench leaning his big shoulders against the wall an idea of jamison hedge the same man who developed our instantaneous interstellar vidcasts forty years ago he was trying to find a method of faster than light travel when he was killed destroyed along with most of his work after that ftl research was abandoned it looked as if there were no future in it wasn t it shown that nothing could travel faster than light the interstellar vidcasts do no hedge developed a valid ftl drive he managed to propel an object at fifty times the speed of light but as the object gained speed its length began to diminish and its mass increased this was in line with familiar twentieth century concepts of mass energy transformation we conjectured that as hedge s object gained velocity it would continue to lose length and gain mass until its length became nil and its mass infinite nobody can imagine such an object go on but what actually occurred is this hedge s object continued to lose length and gain mass until it reached the theoretical limit of velocity the speed of light at that point the object still gaining speed simply ceased to exist having no length it ceased to occupy space it disappeared however the object had not been destroyed it continued on its way gaining momentum each moment moving in an arc across the galaxy away from the sol system hedge s object entered some other realm of being beyond our powers of conception the next phase of hedge s experiment consisted in a search for some way to slow the ftl object down back to a sub ftl speed hence back into our universe this counterprinciple was eventually worked out with what result the death of hedge and destruction of most of his equipment his experimental object in re entering the space time universe came into being in space already occupied by matter possessing an incredible mass just below infinity level hedge s object exploded in a titanic cataclysm it was obvious that no space travel was possible with such a drive virtually all space contains some matter to re enter space would bring automatic destruction hedge had found his ftl drive and his counterprinciple but no one before this has been able to put them to any use reinhart walked over toward the great metal cylinder sherikov jumped down and followed him i don t get it reinhart said you said the principle is no good for space travel that s right what s this for then if the ship explodes as soon as it returns to our universe this is not a ship sherikov grinned slyly icarus is the first practical application of hedge s principles icarus is a bomb so this is our weapon reinhart said a bomb an immense bomb a bomb moving at a velocity greater than light a bomb which will not exist in our universe the centaurans won t be able to detect or stop it how could they as soon as it passes the speed of light it will cease to exist beyond all detection but icarus will be launched outside the lab on the surface he will align himself with proxima centaurus gaining speed rapidly by the time he reaches his destination he will be traveling at ftl icarus will be brought back to this universe within centaurus itself the explosion should destroy the star and wash away most of its planets including their central hub planet armun there is no way they can halt icarus once he has been launched no defense is possible nothing can stop him it is a real fact when will he be ready sherikov s eyes flickered soon exactly how soon the big pole hesitated as a matter of fact there s only one thing holding us back sherikov led reinhart around to the other side of the lab he pushed a lab guard out of the way see this he tapped a round globe open at one end the size of a grapefruit this is holding us up what is it the central control turret this thing brings icarus back to sub ftl flight at the correct moment it must be absolutely accurate icarus will be within the star only a matter of a microsecond if the turret does not function exactly icarus will pass out the other side and shoot beyond the centauran system

the word seemed to depress the astronomer they ate breakfast in silence the industrialist said once you really think they ll come the day looks so normal the astronomer said they ll come that was all afterward the industrialist said you ll pardon me i can t conceive your playing so elaborate a hoax you really spoke to them as i speak to you at least in a sense they can project thoughts i gathered that must be so from your letter how i wonder i could not say i asked them and of course they were vague or perhaps it was just that i could not understand it involves a projector for the focussing of thought and even more than that conscious attention on the part of both projector and receptor it was quite a while before i realized they were trying to think at me such thought projectors may be part of the science they will give us perhaps said the industrialist yet think of the changes it would bring to society a thought projector why not change would be good for us i don t think so it is only in old age that change is unwelcome said the astronomer and races can be old as well as individuals the industrialist pointed out the window you see that road it was built beforethewars i don t know exactly when it is as good now as the day it was built we couldn t possibly duplicate it now the race was young when that was built eh then yes at least they weren t afraid of new things no i

was less solvent than his father perhaps your son will no longer be solvent it becomes too troublesome for the planet to support even the industries that still exist though they are toothpicks to the

almost anything we re very catholic tolerant eclectic catholic we live and let live that s how we ve gotten along the wub eyed the captain and that s why i so violently objected to this business about having me boiled i could see the image in your mind most of me in the frozen food locker some of me in the kettle a bit for your pet cat so you read minds the captain said how interesting anything else i mean what else can you do along those lines a few odds and ends the wub said absently staring around the room a nice apartment you have here captain you keep it quite neat i respect life forms that are tidy some martian birds are quite tidy they throw things out of their nests and sweep them indeed the captain nodded but to get back to the problem quite so you spoke of dining on me the taste i am told is good a little fatty but tender but how can any lasting contact be established between your people and mine if you resort to such barbaric attitudes eat me rather you should discuss

to the mythology of most self conscious races as i interpret it odysseus wanders as an individual aware of himself as such this is the idea of separation of separation from family and country the process of individuation but odysseus returns to his home peterson looked out the port window at the stars endless stars burning intently in the empty universe finally he goes home as must all

a bit of a run between the stations it s so dull for him poor fellow being shut up in his box all the time when he s travelling elma looked down at the beautiful glossy creature with genuine admiration his skin was like enamel his banded scales shone bright and silvery she didn t know why but somehow she felt she wasn t in the least afraid of him i suppose one ought to be repelled at once by a snake she said taking the opposite seat and keeping her glance fixed firmly upon the reptile s eye but then this is such a handsome one i can t say why but i don t feel afraid of him at all as i ought to do every right minded person detests snakes don t they and yet how exquisitely flexible and beautiful he is oh pray don t put him back in his box for me he s basking in the sun here i should be sorry to disturb him cyril waring looked at her in considerable surprise he caught the creature in his hands as he spoke and transferred it at once to a tin box with a perforated lid that lay beside him go back sardanapalus he said in a very musical and pleasant voice forcing the huge beast into the lair with gentle but masterful hands go back and go to sleep sir it s time for your nap oh no i couldn t think of letting him out any more in the carriage to the annoyance of others i m ashamed enough as it is of having unintentionally alarmed you but you came in so unexpectedly you see i hadn t time to put my queer pet away and when the door opened i was afraid he might slip out or get under the seats so all i could do was just to soothe him with my hand and keep him quiet till the door was shut to again indeed i wasn t at all afraid of him elma answered slipping her change into her pocket and looking prettier through her blush than even her usual self on the contrary i really liked to see him he s such a glorious snake the lights and shades on his back are so glancing and so wonderful he s a perfect model of course you re painting him the stranger started i m painting him yes that s true he replied with a look of sudden surprise but why of course please how on earth could you tell i was an artist even elma glanced back in his face and wondered to herself too now she came to think of it how did she know that handsome young man with the charming features and the expressive eyes and the neatly cut brown beard and the attractive manner was an artist at all or anything like it and how did she know the snake was his model for the life of her she couldn t have answered those questions herself i suppose i just guessed it she answered after a short pause blushing still more deeply at the sudden way she had thus been dragged into conversation with the good looking stranger elma s skin was dark a clear and creamy olive brown complexion such as one sometimes sees in southern europe though rarely in england and the effect of the blush through it didn t pass unnoticed by cyril waring s artistic eye he would have given something for the chance of transferring that delicious effect to canvas the delicate transparency of the blush threw up those piercing dark eyes and reflected lustre even on the glossy black hair that fringed her forehead not an english type of beauty at all elma clifford s he thought to himself as he eyed her closely rather spanish or italian or say even hungarian well you guessed right at any rate he went on settling down in his seat once more after boxing his snake but this time face to face with her i m working at a beautiful bit of fern and foliage quite tropical in its way in a wood hereabout and i ve introduced sardanapalus coiled up in the foreground just to give life to the scene don t you know and an excuse for a title i mean to call it the rajah s rest behind great ferns and a mossy bank in front sardanapalus after tiffin rolled spirally round and taking his siesta this meeting was a long wished for occasion elma had never before met a real live painter now it was the cherished idea of her youth to see something some day of that wonderful non existent fantastic world which we still hope for and dream about and call bohemia she longed to move in literary and artistic circles she had fashioned to herself like many other romantic girls a rose coloured picture of bohemian existence not knowing indeed that bohemia is now alas an extinct province since belgravia and kensington swallowed it bodily down digested and assimilated it so this casual talk with the handsome young artist in the second class carriage on the great southern line was to elma as a charming and delightful glimpse of an enchanted region she could never enter it was paradise to the peri she turned the conversation at once therefore with resolute intent upon art and artists determined to make the most while it lasted of this unique opportunity and since the subject of self with an attentive listener is always an attractive one even to modest young men like cyril waring especially when it s a pretty girl who encourages you to dilate upon it why the consequence was that before many minutes were over the handsome young man was discoursing from his full heart to a sympathetic soul about his chosen art its hopes and its ideals accompanied by a running fire of thumb nail illustrations he had even got so far in the course of their intimacy as to take out the portfolio which lay hidden under the seat out of deference to his disguise as a stock broker no doubt and to display before elma s delighted eyes with many explanatory comments as to light and shade or perspective and foreshortening the

here he passed it to his companions i think this is what we ve been waiting for they certainly took their time about it so they want to talk terms scott said are we going along with them that s not for us to decide hendricks sat down where s the communications officer i want the moon base leone pondered as the communications officer raised the outside antenna cautiously scanning the sky above the bunker for any sign of a watching russian ship sir scott said to hendricks it s sure strange they suddenly came around we ve been using the claws for almost a year now all of a sudden they start to fold maybe claws have been getting down in their bunkers one of the big ones the kind with stalks got into an ivan bunker last week eric said it got a whole platoon of them before they got their lid shut how do you know a buddy told me the thing came back with with remains moon base sir the communications officer said on the screen the face of the lunar monitor appeared his crisp uniform contrasted to the uniforms in the bunker and he was clean shaven moon base this is forward command l whistle on terra let me have general thompson the monitor faded presently general thompson s heavy features came into focus what is it major our claws got a single russian runner with a message we don t know whether to act on it there have been tricks like this in the past what s the message the russians want us to send a single officer on policy level over to their lines for a conference they don t state the nature of the conference they say that matters of he consulted the slip matters of grave urgency make it advisable that discussion be opened between a representative of the un forces and themselves he held the message up to the screen for the general to scan thompson s eyes moved what should we do hendricks said send a man out you don t think it s a trap it might be but the location they give for their forward command is correct it s worth a try at any rate i ll send an officer out and report the results to you as soon as he returns all right major thompson broke the connection the screen died up above the antenna came slowly down hendricks rolled up the paper deep in thought i ll go leone said they want somebody at policy level hendricks rubbed his jaw policy level i haven t been outside in months maybe i could use a little air don t you think it s risky hendricks lifted the view sight and gazed into it the remains of the russian were gone only a single claw was in sight it was folding itself back disappearing into the ash like a crab like some hideous metal crab that s the only thing that bothers me hendricks rubbed his wrist i know i m safe as long as i have this on me but there s something about them i hate the damn things i wish we d never invented them there s something wrong with them relentless little if we hadn t invented them the ivans would have hendricks pushed the sight back anyhow it seems to be winning the war i guess that s good sounds like you re getting the same jitters as the ivans hendricks examined his wrist watch i guess i had better get started if i want to be there before dark he took a deep breath and then stepped out onto the gray rubbled ground after a minute he lit a cigarette and stood gazing around him the landscape was dead nothing stirred he could see for miles endless ash and slag ruins of buildings a few trees without leaves or branches only the trunks above him the eternal rolling clouds of gray drifting between terra and the sun major hendricks went on off to the right something scuttled something round and metallic a claw going lickety split after something probably after a small animal a rat they got rats too as a sort of sideline he came to the top of the little hill and lifted his fieldglasses the russian lines were a few miles ahead of him they had a forward command post there the runner had come from it a squat robot with undulating arms passed by him its arms weaving inquiringly the robot went on its way disappearing under some debris hendricks watched it go he had never seen that type before there were getting to be more and more types he had never seen new varieties and sizes coming up from the underground factories hendricks put out his cigarette and hurried on it was interesting the use of artificial forms in warfare how had they got started necessity the soviet union had gained great initial success usual with the side that got the war going most of north america had been blasted off the map retaliation was quick in coming of course the sky was full of circling disc bombers long before the war began they had been up there for years the discs began sailing down all over russia within hours after washington got it but that hadn t helped washington the american bloc governments moved to the moon base the first year there was not much else to do europe was gone a slag heap with dark weeds growing from the ashes and bones most of north america was useless nothing could be planted no one could live a few million people kept going up in canada and down in south america but during the second year soviet parachutists began to drop a few at first then more and more they wore the first really effective anti radiation equipment what was left of american production moved to the moon along with the governments all but the troops the remaining troops stayed behind as best they could a few thousand here a platoon there no one knew exactly where they were they stayed where they coul,5
0,2003,Kite Runner,that same night i wrote my first short story it took me thirty minutes it was a dark little tale about a man who found a magic cup and learned that if he wept into the cup his tears turned into pearls but even though he had always been poor he was a happy man and rarely shed a tear so he found ways to make himself sad so that his tears could make him rich as the pearls piled up so did his greed grow the story ended with the man sitting on a mountain of pearls knife in hand weeping helplessly into the cup with his beloved wife s slain body in his arms,5
1,2001,Life of pi,i know a woman here in toronto who is very dear to my heart she was my foster mother i call her auntieji and she likes that she is quebecoise though she has lived in toronto for over thirty years her french speaking mind still slips on occasion on the understanding of english sounds and so when she first heard of hare krishnas she didn t hear right she heard hairless christians and that is what they were to her for many years when i corrected her i told her that in fact she was not so wrong that hindus in their capacity for love are indeed hairless christians just as muslims in the way they see god in everything are bearded hindus and christians in their devotion to god are hat wearing muslims,5
2,2003,The da vinci code,sophie stopped the taxi at an imposing gate that blocked the bank s driveway a cement lined ramp that descended beneath the building a video camera overhead was aimed directly at them and langdon had the feeling that this camera unlike those at the louvre was authentic sophie rolled down the window and surveyed the electronic podium on the driver s side an lcd screen provided directions in seven languages topping the list was english,5
3,2003,The curious incident of the dog in the night,a lie is when you say something happened which didn t happen but there is only ever one thing which happened at a particular time and a particular place and there are an infinite number of things which didn t happen at that time and that place and if i think about something which didn t happen i start thinking about all the other things which didn t happen for example this morning for breakfast i had ready brek and some hot raspberry milkshake but if i say that i actually had shreddies and a mug of tea i start thinking about coco pops and lemonade and porridge and dr pepper and how i wasn t eating my breakfast in egypt and there wasn t a rhinoceros in the room and father wasn t wearing a diving suit and so on and even writing this makes me feel shaky and scared like i do when i m standing on the top of a very tall building and there are thousands of houses and cars and people below me and my head is so full of all these things that i m afraid that i m going to forget to stand up straight and hang onto the rail and i m going to fall over and be killed,5
4,2005,Twilight,i didn t see him leap me it was much too fast i only found myself suddenly airborne and then we crashed onto the sofa knocking it into the wall all the while his arms formed an iron cage of protection around me i was barely jostled but i still was gasping as i tried to right myself he wasn t having that he curled me into a ball against his chest holding me more securely than iron chains i glared at him in alarm but he seemed well in control his jaw relaxed as he grinned his eyes bright only with humor,5
5,2001,Atonement,now and then an inch below the water s surface the muscles of his stomach tightened involuntarily as he recalled another detail a drop of water on her upper arm wet an embroidered flower a simple daisy sewn between the cups of her bra her breasts wide apart and small on her back a mole half covered by a strap when she climbed out of the pond a glimpse of the triangular darkness her knickers were supposed to conceal wet he saw it he made himself see it again the way her pelvic bones stretched the material clear of the skin the deep curve of her waist her startling whiteness when she reached for her skirt a carelessly raised foot revealed a patch of soil on each pad of her sweetly diminished toes another mole the size of a farthing on her thigh and something purplish on her calf a strawberry mark a scar not blemishes adornments,5
6,2005,never let me go,that was the only time as i stood there looking at that strange rubbish feeling the wind coming across those empty fields that i started to imagine just a little fantasy thing because this was norfolk after all and it was only a couple of weeks since i d lost him i was thinking about the rubbish the flapping plastic in the branches the shore line of odd stuff caught along the fencing and i half closed my eyes and imagined this was the spot where everything i d ever lost since my childhood had washed up and i was now standing here in front of it and if i waited long enough a tiny figure would appear on the horizon across the field and gradually get larger until i d see it was tommy and he d wave maybe even call the fantasy never got beyond that i didn t let it and though the tears rolled down my face i wasn t sobbing or out of control i just waited a bit then turned back to the car to drive off to wherever it was i was supposed to be,5
7,2002,middlesex,emotions in my experience aren t covered by single words i don t believe in sadness joy or regret maybe the best proof that the language is patriarchal is that it oversimplifies feeling i d like to have at my disposal complicated hybrid emotions germanic train car constructions like say the happiness that attends disaster or the disappointment of sleeping with one s fantasy i d like to show how intimations of mortality brought on by aging family members connects with the hatred of mirrors that begins in middle age i d like to have a word for the sadness inspired by failing restaurants as well as for the excitement of getting a room with a minibar i ve never had the right words to describe my life and now that i ve entered my story i need them more than ever,5
8,2006,the road,much better he approved,5
9,1999,the white teeth ,it s a funny thing about the modern world you hear girls in the toilets of clubs saying yeah he fucked off and left me he didn t love me he just couldn t deal with love he was too fucked up to know how to love me now how did that happen what was it about this unlovable century that convinced us we were despite everything eminently lovable as a people as a species what made us think that anyone who fails to love us is damaged lacking malfunctioning in some way and particularly if they replace us with a god or a weeping madonna or the face of christ in a ciabatta roll then we call them crazy deluded regressive we are so convinced of the goodness of ourselves and the goodness of our love we cannot bear to believe that there might be something more worthy of love than us more worthy of worship greeting cards routinely tell us everybody deserves love no everybody deserves clean water not everybody deserves love all the time,5
10,2000,the amber spyglass,i will love you forever whatever happens till i die and after i die and when i find my way out of the land of the dead i ll drift about forever all my atoms till i find you again i ll be looking for you every moment every single moment and when we do find each other again we ll cling together so tight that nothing and no one ll ever tear us apart every atom of me and every atom of you we ll live in birds and flowers and dragonflies and pine trees and in clouds and in those little specks of light you see floating in sunbeams and when they use our atoms to make new lives they won t just be able to take one they ll have to take two one of you and one of me we ll be joined so tight,5
11,2003,a sorty history,thanks to ten minutes or so of balmy weather by the earth is covered in the great carboniferous forests whose residues give us all our coal and the first winged insects are evident dinosaurs plod onto the scene just before p m and hold sway for about three quarters of an hour at twenty one minutes to midnight they vanish and the age of mammals begins humans emerge one minute and seventeen seconds before midnight the whole of our recorded history on this scale would be no more than a few seconds a single human lifetime barely an instant throughout this greatly speeded up day continents slide about and bang together at a clip that seems positively reckless mountains rise and melt away ocean basins come and go ice sheets advance and withdraw and throughout the whole about three times every minute somewhere on the planet there is a flash bulb pop of light marking the impact of a manson sized meteor or one even larger it s a wonder that anything at all can survive in such a pummeled and unsettled environment in fact not many things do for long,5
12,2008,the white tiger,me and thousands of others in this country like me are half baked because we were never allowed to complete our schooling open our skulls look in with a penlight and you ll find an odd museum of ideas sentences of history or mathematics remembered from school textbooks no boy remembers his schooling like the one who was taken out of school let me assure you sentences about politics read in a newspaper while waiting for someone to come to an office triangles and pyramids seen on the torn pages of the old geometry textbooks which every tea shop in this country uses to wrap its snacks in bits of all india radio news bulletins things that drop into your mind like lizards from the ceiling in the half hour before falling asleep all these ideas half formed and half digested and half correct mix up with other half cooked ideas in your head and i guess these half formed ideas bugger one another and make more half formed ideas and this is what you act on and live with,5
13,2004,cloud atlas,belief like fear or love is a force to be understood as we understand the theory of relativity and principals of uncertainty phenomena that determine the course of our lives yesterday my life was headed in one direction today it is headed in another yesterday i believe i would never have done what i did today these forces that often remake time and space that can shape and alter who we imagine ourselves to be begin long before we are born and continue after we perish our lives and our choices like quantum trajectories are understood moment to moment that each point of intersection each encounter suggest a new potential direction proposition i have fallen in love with luisa rey is this possible i just met her and yet i feel like something important has happened to me,5
14,2006,the god delision,let us remind ourselves of the terminology a theist believes in a supernatural intelligence who in addition to his main work of creating the universe in the first place is still around to oversee and influence the subsequent fate of his initial creation in many theistic belief systems the deity is intimately involved in human affairs he answers prayers forgives or punishes sins intervenes in the world by performing miracles frets about good and bad deeds and knows when we do them or even think about doing them a deist too believes in a supernatural intelligence but one whose activities were confined to setting up the laws that govern the universe in the first place the deist god never intervenes thereafter and certainly has no specific interest in human affairs pantheists don t believe in a supernatural god at all but use the word god as a non supernatural synonym for nature or for the universe or for the lawfulness that governs its workings deists differ from theists in that their god does not answer prayers is not interested in sins or confessions does not read our thoughts and does not intervene with capricious miracles deists differ from pantheists in that the deist god is some kind of cosmic intelligence rather than the pantheist s metaphoric or poetic synonym for the laws of the universe pantheism is sexed up atheism deism is watered down theism,5
15,1993,the giver,lily appeared wearing her nightclothes in the doorway she gave an impatient sigh this is certainly a very long private conversation she said and there are certain people waiting for their comfort object lily her mother said fondly you re very close to being an eight and when you re an eight your comfort object will be taken away it will be recycled to the younger children you should be starting to go off to sleep without it but her father had already gone to the shelf and taken down the stuffed elephant which was kept there many of the comfort objects like lily s were soft stuffed imaginary creatures jonas s had been called a bear here you are lily billy he said i ll come help you remove your hair ribbons,5
16,1997,memoirsa of a geisha,to the eyes of the american soldiers who drove past i looked no different from the women around me and as i thought of it who could say i was any different if you no longer have leaves or bark or roots can you go on calling yourself a tree i am a peasant i said to myself and not a geisha at all any longer it was a frightening feeling to look at my hands and see their roughness to draw my mind away from my fears i turned my attention again to the truckloads of soldiers driving past weren t these the very american soldiers we d been taught to hate who had bombed our cities with such horrifying weapons now they rode through our neighborhood throwing pieces of candy to the children,5
17,1995,the golden compass,you are so young lyra too young to understand this but i shall tell you anyway and you ll understand it later men pass in front of our eyes like butterflies creatures of a brief season we love them they are brave proud beautiful clever and they die almost at once they die so soon that our hearts are continually racked with pain we bear their children who are witches if they are female human if not and then in the blink of an eye they are gone felled slain lost our sons too when a little boy is growing he thinks he is immortal his mother knows he isn t each time becomes more painful until finally your heart is broken perhaps that is when yambe akka comes for you she is older than the tundra perhaps for her witches lives are as brief as men s are to us,5
18,1998,the poison wood bible,but his kind will always lose in the end i know this and now i know why whether it s wife or nation they occupy their mistake is the same they stand still and their stake moves underneath them chains rattle rivers roll animals startle and bolt forests inspire and expand babies stretch open mouthed from the womb new seedlings arch their necks and creep forward into the light even a language won t stand still a territory is only possessed for a moment in time they stake everything on that moment posing for photographs while planting the flag casting themselves in bronze even before the flagpole begins to peel and splinter the ground underneath arches and slides forward into its own new destiny it may bear the marks of boots on its back but those marks become the possessions of the land,5
19,1999,the perks of being a wallflower,it s much easier to not know things sometimes things change and friends leave and life doesn t stop for anybody i wanted to laugh or maybe get mad or maybe shrug at how strange everybody was especially me i think the idea is that every person has to live for his or her own life and than make the choice to share it with other people you can t just sit their and put everybody s lives ahead of yours and think that counts as love you just can t you have to do things i m going to do what i want to do i m going to be who i really am and i m going to figure out what that is and we could all sit around and wonder and feel bad about each other and blame a lot of people for what they did or didn t do or what they didn t know i don t know i guess there could always be someone to blame it s just different maybe it s good to put things in perspective but sometimes i think that the only perspective is to really be there because it s okay to feel things i was really there and that was enough to make me feel infinite i feel infinite,5
20,1998,holes,he brought his tray to the table behind him a boy from one of the other tents said hey what happened to your face there was a crash stanley turned to see mr sir holding the boy s head against the oatmeal pot is something wrong with my face the boy tried to speak but couldn t mr sir had him by the throat does anyone see anything wrong with my face asked mr sir as he continued to choke the boy nobody said anything mr sir let the boy go his head banged against the table as he fell to the ground mr sir stood over him and asked how does my face look to you now a gurgling sound came out of the boy s mouth then he managed to gasp the word fine i m kind of handsome don t you think yes mr sir out,5
21,1996,angelas ashes,anytime jesus got hungry all he had to do was go up the road to a fig tree or an orange tree and have his fill if he wanted a pint he could wave his hand over a big glass and there was the pint or he could visit mary magdalene and her sister martha and they d give him his dinner no questions asked and he d get his feet washed and dried with mary magdalene s hair while martha washed the dishes which i don t think is fair why should she have to wash the dishes while her sister sits out there chatting away with our lord it s a good thing jesus decided to be born jewish in that warm place because if he was born in limerick he d catch the consumption and be dead in a month and there wouldn t be any catholic church and there wouldn t be any communion or confirmation and we wouldn t have to learn the catechism and write compositions about him,5
22,1996,fight club,you have a class of young strong men and women and they want to give their lives to something advertising has these people chasing cars and clothes they don t need generations have been working in jobs they hate just so they can buy what they don t really need we don t have a great war in our generation or a great depression but we do we have a great war of the spirit we have a great revolution against the culture the great depression is our lives we have a spiritual depression,5
23,1999,girl with a pearl earring,i had not yet been down to the cellar where i was to sleep i took a candle with me but was too tired to look around beyond finding a bed pillow and blanket leaving the trap door of the cellar open so that cool fresh air could reach me i took off my shoes cap apron and dress prayed briefly and lay down i was about to blow out the candle when i noticed the painting hanging at the foot of my bed i sat up wide awake now it was another picture of christ on the cross smaller than the one upstairs but even more disturbing christ had thrown his head back in pain and mary magdalene s eyes were rolling i iay back gingerly unable to take my eyes off it i could not imagine sleeping in the room with the painting i wanted to take it down but did not dare finally i blew out the candle i could not afford to waste candles on my first day in the new house i lay back again my eyes fixed to the place where i knew the painting hung i slept badly that night tired as i was i woke often and looked for the painting though i could see nothing on the wall every detail was fixed in my mind finally when it was beginning to grow light the painting appeared again and i was sure the virgin mary was looking down at me,5
24,1996,bridget jones diary,being a woman is worse than being a farmer there is so much harvesting and crop spraying to be done legs to be waxed underarms shaved eyebrows plucked feet pumiced skin exfoliated and moisturised spots cleansed roots dyed eyelashes tinted nails filed cellulite massaged stomach muscles exercised the whole performance is so highly tuned you only need to neglect it for a few days for the whole thing to go to seed sometimes i wonder what i would be like if left to revert to nature with a full beard and handlebar moustache on each shin dennis healey eyebrows face a graveyard of dead skin cells spots erupting long curly fingernails like struwelpeter blind as bat and stupid runt of species as no contact lenses flabby body flobbering around ugh ugh is it any wonder girl,5
25,1992,the secret history,ery greek idea and a very profound one beauty is terror whatever we call beautiful we quiver before it and what could be more terrifying and beautiful to souls like the greeks or our own than to lose control completely to throw off the chains of being for an instant to shatter the accident of our mortal selves euripides speaks of the maenads head thrown i back throat to the stars more like deer than human being to be absolutely free one is quite capable of course of working out these destructive passions in more vulgar and less efficient ways but how glorious to release them in a single burst to sing to scream to dance barefoot in the woods in the dead of night with no more awareness of mortality than an animal these are powerful mysteries the bellowing of bulls springs of honey bubbling from the ground if we are strong enough in our souls we can rip away the veil and look that naked terrible beauty right in the face let god consume us devour us unstring our bones then spit us out reborn,5
26,1990,jurassic park,but now science is the belief system that is hundreds of years old and like the medieval system before it science is starting not to fit the world any more science has attained so much power that its practical limits begin to be apparent largely through science billions of us live in one small world densely packed and intercommunicating but science cannot help us decide what to do with that world or how to live science can make a nuclear reactor but it cannot tell us not to build it science can make pesticide but cannot tell us not to use it and our world starts to seem polluted in fundamental ways air and water and land because of ungovernable science,5
27,1998,a clash of kings,mormont gave a whistle and the bird flew to him again and settled on his arm a lord s one thing a king s another they will garb your brother robb in silks satins and velvets of a hundred different colors while you live and die in black ringmail he will wed some beautiful princess and father sons on her you ll have no wife nor will you ever hold a child of your own blood in your arms robb will rule you will serve men will call you a crow him they ll call your grace singers will praise every little thing he does while your greatest deeds all go unsung tell me that none of this troubles you jon and i ll name you a liar and know i have the truth of it,5
28,1990,good omens,ways known that he would be around when the world ended because he was immortal and wouldn t have any alternative but he hoped it was a long way off because he rather liked people it was major failing in a demon oh he did his best to make their short lives miserable because that was his job but nothing he could think up was half as bad as the stuff they thought up themselves they seemed to have a talent for it it was built into the design somehow they were born into a world that was against them in a thousand little ways and then devoted most of their energies to making it worse over the years crowley had found it increasingly difficult to find anything demonic to do which showed up against the natural background of generalized nastiness there had been times over the past millennium when he d felt like sending a message back below saying look we may as well give up right now we might as well shut down dis and pandemonium and everywhere and move up here there s nothing we can do to them that they don t do to themselves and they do things we ve never even thought of often involving electrodes they ve g,5
29,1991,sophies world,w you must choose are you a child who has not yet become world weary or are you a philosopher who will vow never to become so to children the world and everything in it is new something that gives rise to astonishment it is not like that for adults most adults accept the world as a matter of course this is precisely where philosophers are a notable exception a philosopher never gets quite used to the world to him or her the world continues to seem a bit unreasonable bewildering even enigmatic philosophers and small children thus have an important faculty in common the only thing we require to be good philosophers is the faculty of won,5
30,1982,the colour purple,here s the thing say shug the thing i believe god is inside you and inside everybody else you come into the world with god but only them that search for it inside find it and sometimes it just manifest itself even if you not looking or don t know what you looking for trouble do it for most folks i think sorrow lord feeling like shit it i ask yeah it god ain t a he or a she but a it but what do it look like i ask don t look like nothing she say it ain t a picture show it ain t something you can look at apart from anything else including yourself i believe god is everything say shug everything that is or ever was or ever will be and when you cam feel that and be happy to feel that you ve found it,5
31,1985,the hand maids tale,falling in love we said i fell for him we were falling women we believed in it this downward motion so lovely like flying and yet at the same time so dire so extreme so unlikely god is love they once said but we reversed that and love like heaven was always just around the corner the more difficult it was to love the particular man beside us the more we believed in love abstract and total we were waiting always for the incarnation that word made flesh and sometimes it happened for a time that kind of love comes and goes and is hard to remember afterwards like pain you would look at the man one day and you would think i loved you and the tense would be past and you would be filled with a sense of wonder because it was such an amazing and precarious and dumb thing to have done and you would know too why your friends had been evasive about it at the time,5
32,1983,pet semeatary,t s probably wrong to believe there can be any limit to the horror which the human mind can experience on the contrary it seems that some exponential effect begins to obtain as deeper and deeper darkness falls as little as one may like to admit it human experience tends in a good many ways to support the idea that when the nightmare grows black enough horror spawns horror one coincidental evil begets other often more deliberate evils until finally blackness seems to cover everything and the most terrifying question of all may be just how much horror the human mind can stand and still maintain a wakeful staring unrelenting sanity that such events have their own rube goldberg absurdity goes almost without saying at some point it all starts to become rather funny that may be the point at which sanity begins either to save itself or to buckle and break down that point at which one s sense of humor begins to reassert its,5
33,1980,the name of the rose,in that face deformed by hatred of philosophy i saw for the first time the portrait of the antichrist who does not come from the tribe of judas as his heralds have it or from a far country the antichrist can be born from piety itself from excessive love of god or of the truth as the heretic is born from the saint and the possessed from the seer fear prophets adso and those prepared to die for the truth for as a rule they make many others die with them often before them at times instead of them jorge did a diabolical thing because he loved his truth so lewdly that he dared anything in order to destroy falsehood,5
34,1981,midnights children,one kashmiri morning in the early spring of my grandfather aadam aziz hit his nose against a frost hardened tussock of earth while attempting to pray three drops of blood plopped out of his left nostril hardened instantly in the brittle air and lay before his eyes on the prayer mat transformed into rubies lurching back until he knelt with his head once more upright he found that the tears which had sprung to his eyes had solidified too and at that moment as he brushed diamonds contemptuously from his lashes he resolved never again to kiss earth for any god or man this decision however made a hole in him a vacancy in a vital inner chamber leaving him vulnerable to women and history unaware of this at first despite his recently completed medical training he stood up rolled the prayer mat into a thick cheroot and holding it under his right arm surveyed the valley through clear diamond free eyes,5
35,1987,beloved,in this here place we flesh flesh that weeps laughs flesh that dances on bare feet in grass love it love it hard yonder they do not love your flesh they despise it they don t love your eyes they d just as soon pick em out no more do they love the skin on your back yonder they flay it and o my people they do not love your hands those they only use tie bind chop off and leave empty love your hands love them raise them up and kiss them touch others with them pat them together stroke them on your face cause they don t love that either you got to love it you and no they ain t in love with your mouth yonder out there they will see it broken and break it again what you say out of it they will not heed what you scream from it they do not hear what you put into it to nourish your body they will snatch away and give you leavins instead no they don t love your mouth you got to love it this is flesh i m talking about here flesh that needs to be loved feet that need to rest and to dance backs that need support shoulders that need arms strong arms i m telling you and o my people out yonder hear me they do not love your neck unnoosed and straight so love your neck put a hand on it grace it stroke it and hold it up and all your inside parts that they d just as soon slop for hogs you got to love them the dark dark liver love it love it and the beat and beating heart love that too more than eyes or feet more than lungs that have yet to draw free air more than your life holding womb and your life giving private parts hear me now love your heart for this is the prize,5
