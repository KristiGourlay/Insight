Not only would she not say a word towards', 'dissuading him from this change in his old intentions, but she would', 'make the change as little painful to him as possible by teaching him', 'to think that it was justified by her own manner to him.', '', 'For there was a change, not only in his mind, but in his declared', 'intentions. Llanfeare had belonged to Indefer Joneses for many', 'generations. When the late Squire had died, now twenty years ago,', 'there had been remaining out of ten children only one, the eldest,', 'to whom the property now belonged. Four or five coming in succession', 'after him had died without issue. Then there had been a Henry Jones,', 'who had gone away and married, had become the father of the Henry', 'Jones above mentioned, and had then also departed. The youngest, a', 'daughter, had married an attorney named Brodrick, and she also had', 'died, having no other child but Isabel. Mr Brodrick had married', 'again, and was now the father of a large family, living at Hereford,', 'where he carried on his business. He was not very ""well-to-do"" in the', 'world. The new Mrs Brodrick had preferred her own babies to Isabel,', 'and Isabel when she was fifteen years of age had gone to her bachelor', 'uncle at Llanfeare. There she had lived for the last ten years,', 'making occasional visits to her father at Hereford.', '', 'Mr Indefer Jones, who was now between seventy and eighty years old,', 'was a gentleman who through his whole life had been disturbed by', 'reflections, fears, and hopes as to the family property on which he', 'had been born, on which he had always lived, in possession of which', 'he would certainly die, and as to the future disposition of which', 'it was his lot in life to be altogether responsible. It had been', ""entailed upon him before his birth in his grandfather's time, when"", 'his father was about to be married. But the entail had not been', 'carried on. There had come no time in which this Indefer Jones had', 'been about to be married, and the former old man having been given to', 'extravagance, and been generally in want of money, had felt it more', 'comfortable to be without an entail. His son had occasionally been', 'induced to join with him in raising money. Thus not only since he had', ""himself owned the estate, but before his father's death, there had"", 'been forced upon him reflections as to the destination of Llanfeare.', 'At fifty he had found himself unmarried, and unlikely to marry.', 'His brother Henry was then alive; but Henry had disgraced the', 'family,--had run away with a married woman whom he had married after', 'a divorce, had taken to race courses and billiard-rooms, and had been', 'altogether odious to his brother Indefer. Nevertheless the boy which', 'had come from this marriage, a younger Henry, had been educated at', 'his expense, and had occasionally been received at Llanfeare. He', 'had been popular with no one there, having been found to be a sly', 'boy, given to lying, and, as even the servants said about the place,', 'unlike a Jones of Llanfeare. Then had come the time in which Isabel', 'had been brought to Llanfeare. Henry had been sent away from Oxford', 'for some offence not altogether trivial, and the Squire had declared', 'to himself and others that Llanfeare should never fall into his', 'hands.', '', 'Isabel had so endeared herself to him that before she had been', 'two years in the house she was the young mistress of the place.', 'Everything that she did was right in his eyes. She might have', 'anything that she would ask, only that she would ask for nothing. At', 'this time the cousin had been taken into an office in London, and had', 'become,--so it was said of him,--a steady young man of business. But', 'still, when allowed to show himself at Llanfeare, he was unpalatable', 'to them all--unless it might be to the old Squire. It was certainly', 'the case that in his office in London he made himself useful, and it', 'seemed that he had abandoned that practice of running into debt and', 'having the bills sent down to Llanfeare which he had adopted early in', 'his career.', '', 'During all this time the old Squire was terribly troubled about', 'the property. His will was always close at his hand. Till Isabel', ""was twenty-one this will had always been in Henry's favour,--with"", 'a clause, however, that a certain sum of money which the Squire', 'possessed should go to her. Then in his disgust towards his nephew he', ""changed his purpose, and made another will in Isabel's favour. This"", 'remained in existence as his last resolution for three years; but', 'they had been three years of misery to him. He had endured but badly', 'the idea that the place should pass away out of what he regarded as', 'the proper male line. To his thinking it was simply an accident that', 'the power of disposing of the property should be in his hands.

This I have done, and it only remains for me to assure', 'the reader that the record is true, and, to the best of his belief and', 'ability, set down without fear, favour, or prejudice, by one not', 'unaccustomed to such tasks.', '', 'Almost at the commencement of my labours I sought an interview with', 'General Booth, thinking, as I told him and his Officers (the Salvation', 'Army is not mealy-mouthed about such matters) that at his age it would', 'be well to set down his views in black and white.

Whenever a new', 'development came under consideration, the question arose--How is it to', 'be financed? The work they had in hand at present took all their', 'funds. One of their great underlying principles was that of the', 'necessity of self-support, without which no business or undertaking', 'could stand for long. The individual must co-operate in his own moral', 'and physical redemption. At the same time this system of theirs was,', 'in practice, one of the difficulties with which they had to contend,', 'since it caused the benevolent to believe that the Army did not need', 'financial assistance.

There are few, if any, records left of his doings at the', 'university,--unless it be the fact that he did there commence the', 'literary work of his life. The line about the cabbages, and the scheme', 'of the school magazine, can hardly be said to have amounted even to a', 'commencement. In 1829 a little periodical was brought out at Cambridge,', 'called _The Snob_, with an assurance on the title that it was _not_', 'conducted by members of the university.

Thackeray's mind was at all times"", 'peculiarly exercised with a sense of snobbishness. His appreciation of', 'the vice grew abnormally, so that at last he had a morbid horror of a', 'snob--a morbid fear lest this or the other man should turn snob on his', 'hands.

I repeat, the _just_ and', '_wholesome_ contempt; though I see that some of my hearers look', 'surprised at the expression. I assure them, I use it in sincerity; and', 'I should not have ventured to ask you to listen to me this evening,', 'unless I had entertained a profound respect for wealth--true wealth,', 'that is to say; for, of course, we ought to respect neither wealth nor', 'anything else that is false of its kind: and the distinction between', 'real and false wealth is one of the points on which I shall have a few', 'words presently to say to you. But true wealth I hold, as I said, in', 'great honour; and sympathize, for the most part, with that', 'extraordinary feeling of the present age which publicly pays this', 'honour to riches. I cannot, however, help noticing how extraordinary', 'it is, and how this epoch of ours differs from all bygone epochs in', 'having no philosophical nor religious worshippers of the ragged', 'godship of poverty. In the classical ages, not only there were people', 'who voluntarily lived in tubs, and who used gravely to maintain the', 'superiority of tub-life to town-life, but the Greeks and Latins seem', 'to have looked on these eccentric, and I do not scruple to say, absurd', 'people, with as much respect as we do upon large capitalists and', 'landed proprietors; so that really, in those days, no one could be', 'described as purse proud, but only as empty-purse proud. And no less', 'distinct than the honour which those curious Greek people pay to their', 'conceited poor, is the disrespectful manner in which they speak of', 'the rich; so that one cannot listen long either to them, or to the', 'Roman writers who imitated them, without finding oneself entangled in', 'all sorts of plausible absurdities; hard upon being convinced of the', 'uselessness of collecting that heavy yellow substance which we call', 'gold, and led generally to doubt all the most established maxims of', 'political economy. Nor are matters much better in the middle ages. For', 'the Greeks and Romans contented themselves with mocking at rich', 'people, and constructing merry dialogues between Charon and Diogenes', 'or Menippus, in which the ferryman and the cynic rejoiced together as', 'they saw kings and rich men coming down to the shore of Acheron, in', 'lamenting and lamentable crowds, casting their crowns into the dark', 'waters, and searching, sometimes in vain, for the last coin out of all', 'their treasures that could ever be of use to them. But these Pagan', 'views of the matter were indulgent, compared with those which were', 'held in the middle ages, when wealth seems to have been looked upon by', 'the best men not only as contemptible, but as criminal. The purse', 'round the neck is, then, one of the principal signs of condemnation in', 'the pictured Inferno; and the Spirit of Poverty is reverenced with', 'subjection of heart, and faithfulness of affection, like that of a', 'loyal knight for his lady, or a loyal subject for his queen. And', 'truly, it requires some boldness to quit ourselves of these feelings,', 'and to confess their partiality or their error, which, nevertheless,', 'we are certainly bound to do. For wealth is simply one of the greatest', 'powers which can be entrusted to human hands: a power, not indeed to', 'be envied, because it seldom makes us happy; but still less to be', 'abdicated or despised; while, in these days, and in this country, it', 'has become a power all the more notable, in that the possessions of a', 'rich man are not represented, as they used to be, by wedges of gold or', 'coffers of jewels, but by masses of men variously employed, over whose', 'bodies and minds the wealth, according to its direction, exercises', 'harmful or helpful influence, and becomes, in that alternative, Mammon', 'either of Unrighteousness or of Righteousness.', '', 'Now, it seemed to me that since, in the name you have given to this', 'great gathering of British pictures, you recognise them as', 'Treasures--that is, I suppose, as part and parcel of the real wealth', 'of the country--you might not be uninterested in tracing certain', 'commercial questions connected with this particular form of wealth.', 'Most persons express themselves as surprised at its quantity; not', 'having known before to what an extent good art had been accumulated in', 'England: and it will, therefore, I should think, be held a worthy', 'subject of consideration, what are the political interests involved in', 'such accumulations; what kind of labour they represent, and how this', 'labour may in general be applied and economized, so as to produce the', 'richest results.', '', 'Now, you must have patience with me, if in approaching the specialty', 'of this subject, I dwell a little on certain points of general', 'political science already known or established: for though thus, as I', 'believe, established, some which I shall have occasion to rest', 'arguments on are not yet by any means universally accepted; and', 'therefore, though I will not lose time in any detailed defence of', 'them, it is necessary that I should distinctly tell you in what form I', 'receive, and wish to argue from them; and this the more, because there', 'may perhaps be a part of my audience who have not interested', 'themselves in political economy, as it bears on ordinary fields of', 'labour, but may yet wish to hear in what way its principles can be', 'applied to Art.

This seems', 'ungracious, but Mr. Shairp has himself to blame; so good a', 'Wordsworthian was out of character upon that stage.', '', 'This half apology apart, nothing more falls to be said except', 'upon a remark called forth by my study in the columns of a', 'literary Review.

Now I knew, for my own part, that it was with the', 'profoundest pity, but with a growing esteem, that I studied', ""the man's desperate efforts to do right; and the more I"", 'reflected, the stranger it appeared to me that any thinking', 'being should feel otherwise.

And for this there are perhaps', 'two subsidiary reasons.  For, first, there is, in our drunken', 'land, a certain privilege extended to drunkenness.  In', 'Scotland, in particular, it is almost respectable, above all', 'when compared with any ""irregularity between the sexes.""  The', 'selfishness of the one, so much more gross in essence, is so', 'much less immediately conspicuous in its results that our', 'demiurgeous Mrs. Grundy smiles apologetically on its victims.', 'It is often said - I have heard it with these ears - that', 'drunkenness ""may lead to vice.""  Now I did not think it at', 'all proved that Burns was what is called a drunkard; and I', 'was obliged to dwell very plainly on the irregularity and the', 'too frequent vanity and meanness of his relations to women.', 'Hence, in the eyes of many, my study was a step towards the', ""demonstration of Burns's radical badness."", '', 'But second, there is a certain class, professors of that low', 'morality so greatly more distressing than the better sort of', 'vice, to whom you must never represent an act that was', 'virtuous in itself, as attended by any other consequences', ""than a large family and fortune.  To hint that Burns's"", 'marriage had an evil influence is, with this class, to deny', 'the moral law.  Yet such is the fact.  It was bravely done;', 'but he had presumed too far on his strength.  One after', 'another the lights of his life went out, and he fell from', 'circle to circle to the dishonoured sickbed of the end.

In half an hour he heaved a very deep sigh indeed, and said, ""Oh!', 'dear me, I wonder if I shall ever go to sea in the _Fair Nancy_!""', '', 'Time flew on, and little Davy fished with his father, and worked for his', 'mother, and paid many a visit to the building-yard, to watch the', 'progress of the ship--his ship, as he called it.  He begged very hard,', 'too, to be allowed to go in her when she should be ready for sea.  At', 'first neither father nor mother would hear of it, but at last they began', 'to think that Davy would make a very good sailor, for certainly he was', 'an active obedient boy; so, although they did not say Yes, they were not', 'nearly so determined as they used to be in saying No.', '', 'The day of the launch was a great day at the seaport where Davy lived.', 'The launch of a large ship is always a very interesting and wonderful', 'sight indeed; so that thousands and thousands of people flock from all', 'directions to see it.  Whichever way Davy looked he saw crowds of', 'people, some on foot, some on horses, some on donkeys, and some in', ""carriages, all streaming towards the one great point--the ship-builder's"", 'yard.  It seemed quite like a holiday or a fair, and was such a bright,', ""warm, sunny day that people's hearts felt far lighter than usual.  Davy"", 'saw all this at a glance the moment he left home; and, throwing his red', 'nightcap into the air, he gave one long loud hurrah! and ran away as', 'fast as his heavy fishing-boots would let him.', '', 'The ship was very different now from what it had been when he first saw', 'it.  There were four little masts put up in it, on which were hoisted', 'gay and gaudy flags.  Her ""hull,"" or body, was now coppered and neatly', 'painted, while all the rubbish of the building-yard was cleared away, so', 'that everything looked neat and clean.  The stocks, or framework on', 'which she had been built, sloped towards the water, so that when the', 'props were knocked away from the ship, she would slide by her own weight', 'into the sea.  Ships are always built on sloping stocks near to the', ""water's edge; for you can fancy how difficult it would be to drag such a"", 'great thing into the water by main force.  In order to make her slip', 'more easily, the ""ways,"" down which she slides, are covered with grease.', '', 'Very soon the crowds of people stood in silence, expecting the great', 'event of the day; and, as the moment drew nigh, the band, which had been', 'playing all morning, suddenly stopped.  Davy became very anxious,', 'because he was so little that he could not see in the crowd; but,', 'observing a post near at hand, he struggled towards it and climbed to', 'the top of it.  Here he saw famously.  The workmen had begun to knock', 'away the props; there was just one remaining.  At this moment a lady', 'stepped forward with a bottle of wine in her hand to christen the ship.', 'This she did by breaking the bottle against the cutwater; just at that', 'instant she began to move.  Another second and the _Fair Nancy_ rushed', 'down the incline, plunged heavily into the water like some awful', 'sea-monster, and floated out upon her ocean home amid the deafening', 'cheers of the people, especially of little Davy, who sat on the top of', 'the post waving his red cap and shouting with delight.', '', 'After the launch Davy and all the people returned home, and the _Fair', 'Nancy_ was towed to the ""shear-hulk"" to have her masts put in.  The', 'shear-hulk is a large ship in which is placed machinery for lifting', 'masts into other ships.  Every one who has looked at the thick masts of', 'a large vessel, must see at a glance that they could never be put there', 'by any number of men.  Machinery is used to do it, and the shear-hulk', 'contains that machinery; so that when a ship has to get her masts put up', 'she is dragged alongside of this vessel.  In the meantime Davy renewed', 'his prayer to his father to let him go to sea, and at last the old man', 'consented.  His mother cried a good deal at first, and hoped that Davy', 'would not think of it; but his father said that it would do him good,', 'and if he became tired of it after the first voyage he could give it up.', 'Davy was overjoyed at this, and went immediately to his friend the', 'fisherman, Ben Block, who was very much delighted too, and took him to a', 'shop to buy clothes and a sea-chest for the voyage.', '', '""You see, lad,"" said Ben, ""the ship is bound for Quebec with a mixed', 'cargo, and is to come back loaded with timber; and as the season is', 'coming on, you\'ll need to get ready quick.""', '', '""That I shall,"" replied Davy, as they entered a shop.

The five romances studied with a different purpose', 'might have given different results, even with a critic so', 'warmly interested in their favour.  The great contemporary', 'master of wordmanship, and indeed of all literary arts and', 'technicalities, had not unnaturally dazzled a beginner.  But', 'it is best to dwell on merits, for it is these that are most', 'often overlooked.', '', 'BURNS. - I have left the introductory sentences on Principal', 'Shairp, partly to explain my own paper, which was merely', 'supplemental to his amiable but imperfect book, partly', 'because that book appears to me truly misleading both as to', 'the character and the genius of Burns.  This seems', 'ungracious, but Mr. Shairp has himself to blame; so good a', 'Wordsworthian was out of character upon that stage.', '', 'This half apology apart, nothing more falls to be said except', 'upon a remark called forth by my study in the columns of a', 'literary Review.  The exact terms in which that sheet', 'disposed of Burns I cannot now recall; but they were to this', 'effect - that Burns was a bad man, the impure vehicle of fine', 'verses; and that this was the view to which all criticism', 'tended.  Now I knew, for my own part, that it was with the', 'profoundest pity, but with a growing esteem, that I studied', ""the man's desperate efforts to do right; and the more I"", 'reflected, the stranger it appeared to me that any thinking', 'being should feel otherwise.  The complete letters shed,', 'indeed, a light on the depths to which Burns had sunk in his', 'character of Don Juan, but they enhance in the same', 'proportion the hopeless nobility of his marrying Jean.  That', 'I ought to have stated this more noisily I now see; but that', 'any one should fail to see it for himself, is to me a thing', 'both incomprehensible and worthy of open scorn.  If Burns, on', 'the facts dealt with in this study, is to be called a bad', 'man, I question very much whether either I or the writer in', 'the Review have ever encountered what it would be fair to', 'call a good one.  All have some fault.  The fault of each', 'grinds down the hearts of those about him, and - let us not', 'blink the truth - hurries both him and them into the grave.', 'And when we find a man persevering indeed, in his fault, as', 'all of us do, and openly overtaken, as not all of us are, by', 'its consequences, to gloss the matter over, with too polite', 'biographers, is to do the work of the wrecker disfiguring', 'beacons on a perilous seaboard; but to call him bad, with a', ""self-righteous chuckle, is to be talking in one's sleep with"", 'Heedless and Too-bold in the arbour.', '', 'Yet it is undeniable that much anger and distress is raised', 'in many quarters by the least attempt to state plainly, what', ""every one well knows, of Burns's profligacy, and of the fatal"", 'consequences of his marriage.  And for this there are perhaps', 'two subsidiary reasons.  For, first, there is, in our drunken', 'land, a certain privilege extended to drunkenness.  In', 'Scotland, in particular, it is almost respectable, above all', 'when compared with any ""irregularity between the sexes.""  The', 'selfishness of the one, so much more gross in essence, is so', 'much less immediately conspicuous in its results that our', 'demiurgeous Mrs. Grundy smiles apologetically on its victims.', 'It is often said - I have heard it with these ears - that', 'drunkenness ""may lead to vice.""  Now I did not think it at', 'all proved that Burns was what is called a drunkard; and I', 'was obliged to dwell very plainly on the irregularity and the', 'too frequent vanity and meanness of his relations to women.', 'Hence, in the eyes of many, my study was a step towards the', ""demonstration of Burns's radical badness."", '', 'But second, there is a certain class, professors of that low', 'morality so greatly more distressing than the better sort of', 'vice, to whom you must never represent an act that was', 'virtuous in itself, as attended by any other consequences', ""than a large family and fortune.  To hint that Burns's"", 'marriage had an evil influence is, with this class, to deny', 'the moral law.  Yet such is the fact.  It was bravely done;', 'but he had presumed too far on his strength.  One after', 'another the lights of his life went out, and he fell from', 'circle to circle to the dishonoured sickbed of the end.

It is his chief title that he', 'refrained from ""the wrong that amendeth wrong.""

But the first', 'and most obvious reason is the mere statement that George Bernard Shaw', 'was born in Dublin in 1856. At least one reason why Englishmen cannot', 'understand Mr. Shaw is that Englishmen have never taken the trouble to', 'understand Irishmen. They will sometimes be generous to Ireland; but', 'never just to Ireland. They will speak to Ireland; they will speak for', 'Ireland; but they will not hear Ireland speak.

The more we saw in the Irishman a sort of warm and weak', 'fidelity, the more he regarded us with a sort of icy anger.

But, indeed, it is', 'needless to say that such comic cross-purposes could be put into a play;', 'they have been put into a play. They have been put into what is perhaps', ""the most real of Mr. Bernard Shaw's plays, _John Bull's Other Island_."", '', 'It is somewhat absurd to imagine that any one who has not read a play by', 'Mr. Shaw will be reading a book about him.

It is indefensibly foolish to attempt to explain a man', 'whose whole object through life has been to explain himself.

Besides, it is more important to', 'put the reader right about England and Ireland even than to put him', 'right about Shaw.

Scarcely anyone but a typical Irishman could have made', 'the remark. It is in fact a bull, a conscious bull. A bull is only a', 'paradox which people are too stupid to understand. It is the rapid', 'summary of something which is at once so true and so complex that the', 'speaker who has the swift intelligence to perceive it, has not the slow', 'patience to explain it. Mystical dogmas are much of this kind. Dogmas', 'are often spoken of as if they were signs of the slowness or endurance', 'of the human mind. As a matter of fact, they are marks of mental', 'promptitude and lucid impatience. A man will put his meaning mystically', 'because he cannot waste time in putting it rationally. Dogmas are not', 'dark and mysterious; rather a dogma is like a flash of lightning--an', 'instantaneous lucidity that opens across a whole landscape. Of the same', 'nature are Irish bulls; they are summaries which are too true to be', 'consistent. The Irish make Irish bulls for the same reason that they', 'accept Papal bulls.

Each of them', 'is an argument impatiently shortened into an epigram. Each of them', 'represents a truth hammered and hardened, with an almost disdainful', 'violence until it is compressed into a small space, until it is made', 'brief and almost incomprehensible. The case of that curt remark about', 'Ireland and Yorkshire is a very typical one. If Mr. Shaw had really', 'attempted to set out all the sensible stages of his joke, the sentence', 'would have run something like this: ""That I am an Irishman is a fact of', 'psychology which I can trace in many of the things that come out of me,', 'my fastidiousness, my frigid fierceness and my distrust of mere', 'pleasure.

In the first place, it is impossible to see', 'intelligently to the bottom of the momentous spirit of ultramontanism,', 'which is so deep a difficulty of continental Europe, and which, touching', 'us in Ireland, is perhaps already one of our own deepest difficulties,', 'without comprehending in its best shape the theory on which', 'ultramontanism rests. And this theory it is impossible to seize', 'thoroughly, without some knowledge of the ideas of its most efficient', 'defenders in its earlier years. Secondly, it is among these ideas that', 'we have to look for the representation in their most direct, logical,', 'uncompromising, and unmistakable form of those theological ways of', 'regarding life and prescribing right conduct, whose more or less rapidly', 'accelerated destruction is the first condition of the further elevation', 'of humanity, as well in power of understanding as in morals and', 'spirituality. In all contests of this kind there is the greatest and', 'most obvious advantage in being able to see your enemy full against the', 'light. Thirdly, in one or two respects, the Catholic reactionaries at', 'the beginning of the century insisted very strongly on principles of', 'society which the general thought of the century before had almost', 'entirely dropped out of sight, and which we who, in spite of many', 'differences, still sail down the same great current, and are propelled', 'by the same great tide, are accustomed almost equally either to leave in', 'the background of speculation, or else deliberately to deny and', 'suppress. Such we may account the importance which they attach to', 'organisation, and the value they set upon a common spiritual faith and', 'doctrine as a social basis. That the form which the recognition of these', 'principles is destined to assume will at all correspond to their hopes', 'and anticipations, is one of the most unlikely things possible. This,', 'however, need not detract from the worth for our purpose of their', 'exposition of the principles themselves. Again, the visible traces of', 'the impression made by the writings of this school on the influential', 'founder of the earliest Positivist system, are sufficiently deep and', 'important to make some knowledge of them of the highest historical', 'interest, both to those who accept and those who detest that system.', '', 'At the beginning of the nineteenth century, there were three chief', 'schools of thought, the Sensational, the Catholic, and the Eclectic; or', 'as it may be put in other terms, the Materialist, the Theological, and', 'the Spiritualist. The first looked for the sources of knowledge, the', 'sanction of morals, the inspiring fountain and standard of Ã¦sthetics, to', 'the outside of men, to matter, and the impressions made by matter on the', 'corporeal senses. The second looked to divine revelation, authority and', 'the traditions of the Church. The third, steering a middle course,', 'looked partly within and partly without, relied partly on the senses,', 'partly on revelation and history, but still more on a certain internal', 'consciousness of a direct and immediate kind, which is the supreme and', 'reconciling judge of the reports alike of the senses, of history, of', 'divine revelation.[1] Each of these schools had many exponents. The', 'three most conspicuous champions of revived Catholicism were De Maistre,', 'De Bonald, and Chateaubriand. The last of them, the author of the _GÃ©nie', 'du Christianisme_, was effective in France because he is so deeply', 'sentimental, but he was too little trained in speculation, and too', 'little equipped with knowledge, to be fairly taken as the best', 'intellectual representative of their way of thinking. De Bonald was of', 'much heavier calibre. He really thought, while Chateaubriand only felt,', 'and the _LÃ©gislation Primitive_ and the _PensÃ©es sur Divers Sujets_', 'contain much that an enemy of the school will find it worth while to', 'read, in spite of an artificial, and, if a foreigner may judge, a', 'detestable style.', '', 'De Maistre was the greatest of the three, and deserves better than', 'either of the others to stand as the type of the school for many', 'reasons. His style is so marvellously lucid, that, notwithstanding the', 'mystical, or, as he said, the illuminist side of his mind, we can never', 'be in much doubt about his meaning, which is not by any means the case', 'with Bonald. To say nothing of his immensely superior natural capacity,', ""De Maistre's extensive reading in the literature of his foes was a"", 'source of strength, which might indeed have been thought indispensable,', 'if only other persons had not attacked the same people as he did,', 'without knowing much or anything at all at first-hand about them. Then', 'he goes over the whole field of allied subjects, which we have a right', 'to expect to have handled by anybody with a systematic view of the', 'origin of knowledge, the meaning of ethics, the elements of social order', 'and progressiveness, the government and scheme of the universe. And', 'above all, his writings are penetrated with the air of reality and life,', 'which comes of actual participation in the affairs of that world with', 'which social philosophers have to deal. Lamennais had in many respects a', 'finer mind than De Maistre, but the conclusions in which he was finally', 'landed, no less than his liberal aims, prevent him from being an example', 'of the truly Catholic reaction. He obviously represented the Revolution,', ""or the critical spirit, within the Catholic limits, while De Maistre's"", ""ruling idea was, in his own trenchant phrase, '_absolument tuer"", ""l'esprit du dix-huitiÃ¨me siÃ¨cle_.'

This seems', 'ungracious, but Mr. Shairp has himself to blame; so good a', 'Wordsworthian was out of character upon that stage.', '', 'This half apology apart, nothing more falls to be said except', 'upon a remark called forth by my study in the columns of a', 'literary Review.  The exact terms in which that sheet', 'disposed of Burns I cannot now recall; but they were to this', 'effect - that Burns was a bad man, the impure vehicle of fine', 'verses; and that this was the view to which all criticism', 'tended.  Now I knew, for my own part, that it was with the', 'profoundest pity, but with a growing esteem, that I studied', ""the man's desperate efforts to do right; and the more I"", 'reflected, the stranger it appeared to me that any thinking', 'being should feel otherwise.  The complete letters shed,', 'indeed, a light on the depths to which Burns had sunk in his', 'character of Don Juan, but they enhance in the same', 'proportion the hopeless nobility of his marrying Jean.  That', 'I ought to have stated this more noisily I now see; but that', 'any one should fail to see it for himself, is to me a thing', 'both incomprehensible and worthy of open scorn.  If Burns, on', 'the facts dealt with in this study, is to be called a bad', 'man, I question very much whether either I or the writer in', 'the Review have ever encountered what it would be fair to', 'call a good one.  All have some fault.

And for this there are perhaps', 'two subsidiary reasons.  For, first, there is, in our drunken', 'land, a certain privilege extended to drunkenness.  In', 'Scotland, in particular, it is almost respectable, above all', 'when compared with any ""irregularity between the sexes.""  The', 'selfishness of the one, so much more gross in essence, is so', 'much less immediately conspicuous in its results that our', 'demiurgeous Mrs. Grundy smiles apologetically on its victims.', 'It is often said - I have heard it with these ears - that', 'drunkenness ""may lead to vice.""  Now I did not think it at', 'all proved that Burns was what is called a drunkard; and I', 'was obliged to dwell very plainly on the irregularity and the', 'too frequent vanity and meanness of his relations to women.', 'Hence, in the eyes of many, my study was a step towards the', ""demonstration of Burns's radical badness."", '', 'But second, there is a certain class, professors of that low', 'morality so greatly more distressing than the better sort of', 'vice, to whom you must never represent an act that was', 'virtuous in itself, as attended by any other consequences', ""than a large family and fortune.  To hint that Burns's"", 'marriage had an evil influence is, with this class, to deny', 'the moral law.  Yet such is the fact.  It was bravely done;', 'but he had presumed too far on his strength.  One after', 'another the lights of his life went out, and he fell from', 'circle to circle to the dishonoured sickbed of the end.  And', 'surely for any one that has a thing to call a soul he shines', 'out tenfold more nobly in the failure of that frantic effort', 'to do right, than if he had turned on his heel with Worldly', 'Wiseman, married a congenial spouse, and lived orderly and', 'died reputably an old man.  It is his chief title that he', 'refrained from ""the wrong that amendeth wrong.""

This incessant', 'interruption, he, one of the most impatient of men, submitted to, and', 'wrote under that interruption several volumes of his History and all', 'else that he had to write during those years.', '', 'The only thing besides Greek, that I learnt as a lesson in this part', 'of my childhood, was arithmetic: this also my father taught me: it was', 'the task of the evenings, and I well remember its disagreeableness.', 'But the lessons were only a part of the daily instruction I received.', ""Much of it consisted in the books I read by myself, and my father's"", 'discourses to me, chiefly during our walks. From 1810 to the end of', '1813 we were living in Newington Green, then an almost rustic', ""neighbourhood. My father's health required considerable and constant"", 'exercise, and he walked habitually before breakfast, generally in the', 'green lanes towards Hornsey. In these walks I always accompanied him,', 'and with my earliest recollections of green fields and wild flowers,', 'is mingled that of the account I gave him daily of what I had read the', 'day before. To the best of my remembrance, this was a voluntary rather', 'than a prescribed exercise. I made notes on slips of paper while', 'reading, and from these in the morning walks, I told the story to him;', 'for the books were chiefly histories, of which I read in this manner', ""a great number: Robertson's histories, Hume, Gibbon; but my greatest"", ""delight, then and for long afterwards, was Watson's _Philip the Second"", 'and Third_. The heroic defence of the Knights of Malta against the', 'Turks, and of the revolted Provinces of the Netherlands against Spain,', 'excited in me an intense and lasting interest. Next to Watson, my', ""favourite historical reading was Hooke's _History of Rome_. Of Greece"", 'I had seen at that time no regular history, except school abridgments', ""and the last two or three volumes of a translation of Rollin's"", '_Ancient History_, beginning with Philip of Macedon. But I read with', ""great delight Langhorne's translation of Plutarch. In English history,"", ""beyond the time at which Hume leaves off, I remember reading Burnet's"", '_History of his Own Time_, though I cared little for anything in it', 'except the wars and battles; and the historical part of the _Annual', 'Register_, from the beginning to about 1788, where the volumes my', 'father borrowed for me from Mr. Bentham left off. I felt a lively', 'interest in Frederic of Prussia during his difficulties, and in Paoli,', 'the Corsican patriot; but when I came to the American War, I took my', 'part, like a child as I was (until set right by my father) on the', 'wrong side, because it was called the English side. In these frequent', 'talks about the books I read, he used, as opportunity offered, to give', 'me explanations and ideas respecting civilization, government, morality,', 'mental cultivation, which he required me afterwards to restate to him', 'in my own words. He also made me read, and give him a verbal account of,', 'many books which would not have interested me sufficiently to induce me', ""to read them of myself: among other's Millar's _Historical View of the"", 'English Government_, a book of great merit for its time, and which he', ""highly valued; Mosheim's _Ecclesiastical History_, McCrie's _Life of"", ""John Knox_, and even Sewell and Rutty's Histories of the Quakers. He was"", 'fond of putting into my hands books which exhibited men of energy and', 'resource in unusual circumstances, struggling against difficulties and', ""overcoming them: of such works I remember Beaver's _African Memoranda_,"", ""and Collins's _Account of the First Settlement of New South Wales_."", ""Two books which I never wearied of reading were Anson's Voyages, so"", ""delightful to most young persons, and a collection (Hawkesworth's, I"", 'believe) of _Voyages round the World_, in four volumes, beginning with', 'Drake and ending with ']"

She had herself put the rocking-chair in"", 'the sunny bay-window, and Northwick had not allowed it to be disturbed', 'there since her death. In an alcove at one side he had made a place for', 'the safe where he kept his papers; his wife had intended to keep their', 'silver in it, but she had been scared by the notion of having burglars', 'so close to them in the night, and had always left the silver in the', 'safe in the dining-room.', '', 'She was all her life a timorous creature, and after her marriage had', ""seldom felt safe out of Northwick's presence.

She was', 'really one of those hen-minded women, who are so common in all walks of', 'life, and are made up of only one aim at a time, and of manifold', 'anxieties at all times. Her instinct for saving long survived the days', ""of struggle in which she had joined it to Northwick's instinct for"", 'getting; she lived and died in the hope, if not the belief, that she had', 'contributed to his prosperity by looking strictly after all manner of', 'valueless odds and ends. But he had been passively happy with her; since', 'her death, he had allowed her to return much into his thoughts, from', 'which her troublesome solicitudes and her entire uselessness in', 'important matters had obliged him to push her while she lived. He often', 'had times when it seemed to him that he was thinking of nothing, and', 'then he found he had been thinking of her. At such times, with a pang,', 'he realized that he missed her; but perhaps the wound was to habit', 'rather than affection. He now sat down in his swivel-chair and turned it', 'from the writing-desk which stood on the rug before the fireplace, and', 'looked up into the eyes of her effigy with a sense of her intangible', 'presence in it, and with a dumb longing to rest his soul against hers.', 'She was the only one who could have seen him in his wish to have not', 'been what he was; she would have denied it to his face, if he had told', 'her he was a thief; and as he meant to make himself more and more a', 'thief, her love would have eased the way by full acceptance of the', 'theories that ran along with his intentions and covered them with', 'pretences of necessity.

Before the trial took place, Harley, at whose instigation', 'the pamphlets had been written, secured his henchman a royal pardon.', '', 'When the Tories fell from power at the death of Queen Anne (1714), and', 'the Whigs again obtained possession of the government, only one of two', 'courses was open to Defoe: he must either retire permanently from', 'politics, or again change sides.

She had a scheme in her head for a long series of short tales', 'to illustrate some of the propositions of political economy.

The times', 'were bad; cholera was abroad; people were full of apprehension and', 'concern about the Reform Bill; and the publishers looked coldly on a', 'doubtful venture.

And yet, at the', 'outset of his studies, he finds that no adaptive reason whatsoever can', 'be given for one-half of the peculiarities of vegetable structure; he', 'also discovers rudimentary teeth, which are never used, in the gums of', 'the young calf and in those of the foetal whale; insects which never', 'bite have rudimental jaws, and others which never fly have rudimental', 'wings; naturally blind creatures have rudimental eyes; and the halt', 'have rudimentary limbs.  So, again, no animal or plant puts on its', 'perfect form at once, but all have to start from the same point,', 'however various the course which each has to pursue.  Not only men and', 'horses, and cats and dogs, lobsters and beetles, periwinkles and', 'mussels, but even the very sponges and animalcules commence their', 'existence under forms which are essentially undistinguishable; and this', 'is true of all the infinite variety of plants.

The white bear cannot', ""live where the tiger thrives, nor 'vice versa', and the more the"", 'natural habits of animal and vegetable species are examined, the more', 'do they seem, on the whole, limited to particular provinces.  But when', 'we look into the facts established by the study of the geographical', 'distribution of animals and plants it seems utterly hopeless to attempt', 'to understand the strange and apparently capricious relations which', ""they exhibit.

We saw the differences, too,', 'betwixt a church in which the same form of worship for which it was', 'originally built is still kept up, and those of England, where it has', 'been superseded for centuries; for here, in the recess of every arch of', 'the side aisles, beneath each lofty window, there was a chapel dedicated', 'to some Saint, and adorned with great marble sculptures of the', 'crucifixion, and with pictures, execrably bad, in all cases, and various', 'kinds of gilding and ornamentation.  Immensely tall wax candles stand', 'upon the altars of these chapels, and before one sat a woman, with a', 'great supply of tapers, one of which was burning.

In every chapel, moreover, there was a confessional,--a little', 'oaken structure, about as big as a sentry-box, with a closed part for the', 'priest to sit in, and an open one for the penitent to kneel at, and', ""speak, through the open-work of the priest's closet.  Monuments, mural"", 'and others, to long-departed worthies, and images of the Saviour, the', 'Virgin, and saints, were numerous everywhere about the church; and in the', 'chancel there was a great deal of quaint and curious sculpture, fencing', 'in the Holy of Holies, where the High Altar stands.

The only things to be', 'seen not fixedly staring and glaring were the vines drooping under their', 'load of grapes. These did occasionally wink a little, as the hot air', 'barely moved their faint leaves.', '', 'There was no wind to make a ripple on the foul water within the harbour,', 'or on the beautiful sea without. The line of demarcation between the two', 'colours, black and blue, showed the point which the pure sea would not', 'pass; but it lay as quiet as the abominable pool, with which it never', 'mixed. Boats without awnings were too hot to touch; ships blistered at', 'their moorings; the stones of the quays had not cooled, night or', 'day, for months. Hindoos, Russians, Chinese, Spaniards, Portuguese,', 'Englishmen, Frenchmen, Genoese, Neapolitans, Venetians, Greeks, Turks,', 'descendants from all the builders of Babel, come to trade at Marseilles,', 'sought the shade alike--taking refuge in any hiding-place from a sea too', 'intensely blue to be looked at, and a sky of purple, set with one great', 'flaming jewel of fire.', '', 'The universal stare made the eyes ache. Towards the distant line of', 'Italian coast, indeed, it was a little relieved by light clouds of mist,', 'slowly rising from the evaporation of the sea, but it softened nowhere', 'else. Far away the staring roads, deep in dust, stared from the', 'hill-side, stared from the hollow, stared from the interminable', 'plain. Far away the dusty vines overhanging wayside cottages, and the', 'monotonous wayside avenues of parched trees without shade, drooped', 'beneath the stare of earth and sky. So did the horses with drowsy bells,', 'in long files of carts, creeping slowly towards the interior; so did', 'their recumbent drivers, when they were awake, which rarely happened;', 'so did the exhausted labourers in the fields. Everything that lived or', 'grew, was oppressed by the glare; except the lizard, passing swiftly', 'over rough stone walls, and the cicala, chirping his dry hot chirp, like', 'a rattle. The very dust was scorched brown, and something quivered in', 'the atmosphere as if the air itself were panting.', '', 'Blinds, shutters, curtains, awnings, were all closed and drawn to keep', 'out the stare. Grant it but a chink or keyhole, and it shot in like a', 'white-hot arrow. The churches were the freest from it.

So, with people lounging and lying wherever', 'shade was, with but little hum of tongues or barking of dogs, with', 'occasional jangling of discordant church bells and rattling of vicious', 'drums, Marseilles, a fact to be strongly smelt and tasted, lay broiling', 'in the sun one day. In Marseilles that day there was a villainous', 'prison. In one of its chambers, so repulsive a place that even the', 'obtrusive stare blinked at it, and left it to such refuse of reflected', 'light as it could find for itself, were two men. Besides the two men,', 'a notched and disfigured bench, immovable from the wall, with a', 'draught-board rudely hacked upon it with a knife, a set of draughts,', 'made of old buttons and soup bones, a set of dominoes, two mats, and two', 'or three wine bottles.

The bars were wide enough apart to', 'admit of his thrusting his arm through to the elbow; and so he held on', 'negligently, for his greater ease.', '', 'A prison taint was on everything there. The imprisoned air, the', 'imprisoned light, the imprisoned damps, the imprisoned men, were all', 'deteriorated by confinement.

He jerked', 'his great cloak more heavily upon him by an impatient movement of one', ""shoulder, and growled, 'To the devil with this Brigand of a Sun that"", ""never shines in here!'"", '', 'He was waiting to be fed, looking sideways through the bars that he', 'might see the further down the stairs, with much of the expression of', 'a wild beast in similar expectation.

I have been very fortunate in worldly matters; many men have worked much harder, and not succeeded half so well; but I never could have done what I have done, without the habits of punctuality, order, and diligence, without the determination to concentrate myself on one object at a time, no matter how quickly its successor should come upon its heels, which I then formed.

These habits and instincts are all the results of', 'physiological differences and peculiarities, which have been developed', 'from a common stock, at least there is every reason to believe so.', 'But it is a most singular circumstance, that while you may run through', 'almost the whole series of physiological processes, without finding a', 'check to your argument, you come at last to a point where you do find', 'a check, and that is in the reproductive processes. For there is a most', 'singular circumstance in respect to natural species--at least about some', 'of them--and it would be sufficient for the purposes of this argument if', 'it were true of only one of them, but there is, in fact, a great number', 'of such cases--and that is, that, similar as they may appear to be', 'to mere races or breeds, they present a marked peculiarity in the', 'reproductive process. If you breed from the male and female of the same', 'race, you of course have offspring of the like kind, and if you make the', 'offspring breed together, you obtain the same result, and if you breed', 'from these again, you will still have the same kind of offspring; there', 'is no check. But if you take members of two distinct species, however', 'similar they may be to each other and make them breed together, you will', 'find a check, with some modifications and exceptions, however, which I', 'shall speak of presently. If you cross two such species with each other,', 'then,--although you may get offspring in the case of the first cross,', 'yet, if you attempt to breed from the products of that crossing, which', 'are what are called HYBRIDS--that is, if you couple a male and a female', 'hybrid--then the result is that in ninety-nine cases out of a hundred', 'you will get no offspring at all; there will be no result whatsoever.', '', 'The reason of this is quite obvious in some cases; the male hybrids,', 'although possessing all the external appearances and characteristics', 'of perfect animals, are physiologically imperfect and deficient in the', 'structural parts of the reproductive elements necessary to generation.', 'It is said to be invariably the case with the male mule, the cross', 'between the Ass and the Mare; and hence it is, that, although crossing', 'the Horse with the Ass is easy enough, and is constantly done, as far as', 'I am aware, if you take two mules, a male and a female, and endeavour to', 'breed from them, you get no offspring whatever; no generation will take', 'place. This is what is called the sterility of the hybrids between two', 'distinct species.', '', 'You see that this is a very extraordinary circumstance; one does not see', 'why it should be. The common teleological explanation is, that it is', 'to prevent the impurity of the blood resulting from the crossing of one', 'species with another, but you see it does not in reality do anything of', 'the kind. There is nothing in this fact that hybrids cannot breed with', 'each other, to establish such a theory; there is nothing to prevent the', 'Horse breeding with the Ass, or the Ass with the Horse. So that this', 'explanation breaks down, as a great many explanations of this kind do,', 'that are only founded on mere assumptions.', '', 'Thus you see that there is a great difference between ""mongrels,"" which', 'are crosses between distinct races, and ""hybrids,"" which are crosses', 'between distinct species. The mongrels are, so far as we know, fertile', 'with one another. But between species, in many cases, you cannot succeed', 'in obtaining even the first cross: at any rate it is quite certain that', 'the hybrids are often absolutely infertile one with another.', '', 'Here is a feature, then, great or small as it may be, which', 'distinguishes natural species of animals. Can we find any approximation', 'to this in the different races known to be produced by selective', 'breeding from a common stock? Up to the present time the answer to that', 'question is absolutely a negative one. As far as we know at present,', 'there is nothing approximating to this check. In crossing the breeds', 'between the Fantail and the Pouter, the Carrier and the Tumbler, or any', 'other variety or race you may name--so far as we know at present--there', 'is no difficulty in breeding together the mongrels. Take the Carrier and', 'the Fantail, for instance, and let them represent the Horse and the Ass', 'in the case of distinct species; then you have, as the result of their', 'breeding, the Carrier-Fantail mongrel,--we will say the male and female', 'mongrel,--and, as far as we know, these two when crossed would not be', 'less fertile than the original cross, or than Carrier with Carrier.', 'Here, you see, is a physiological contrast between the races produced', 'by selective modification and natural species. I shall inquire into the', 'value of this fact, and of some modifying circumstances by and by; for', 'the present I merely put it broadly before you.', '', 'But while considering this question of the limitations of species, a', 'word must be said about what is called RECURRENCE--the tendency of races', 'which have been developed by selective breeding from varieties to return', 'to their primitive type. This is supposed by many to put an absolute', 'limit to the extent of selective and all other variations. People say,', '""It is all very well to talk about producing these different races,', 'but you know very well that if you turned all these birds wild, these', 'Pouters, and Carriers, and so on, they would all return to their', 'primitive stock."" This is very commonly assumed to be a fact, and it is', 'an argument that is commonly brought forward as conclusive; but if you', 'will take the trouble to inquire into it rather closely, I think you', 'will find that it is not worth very much.

In this way the trade augmented, and was drawn from', 'remote quarters to Montreal.

Economy in the Use of Words.', '', 'Â§ 5. The greater forcibleness of Saxon English, or rather non-Latin', 'English, first claims our attention. The several special reasons', 'assignable for this may all be reduced to the general reason--economy.', ""The most important of them is early association. A child's vocabulary is"", 'almost wholly Saxon. He says, _I have,_ not _I possess_---_I wish,_', 'not I _desire;_ he does not _reflect,_ he _thinks;_ he does not beg', 'for _amusement,_ but for _play_; he calls things _nice_ or _nasty,_', 'not _pleasant_ or _disagreeable._ The synonyms which he learns in after', 'years, never become so closely, so organically connected with the ideas', 'signified, as do these original words used in childhood; and hence the', 'association remains less strong. But in what does a strong association', 'between a word and an idea differ from a weak one? Simply in the greater', 'ease and rapidity of the suggestive action. It can be in nothing else.', 'Both of two words, if they be strictly synonymous, eventually call up', 'the same image. The expression--It is _acid,_ must in the end give rise', 'to the same thought as--It is sour; but because the term _acid_ was', 'learnt later in life, and has not been so often followed by the thought', 'symbolized, it does not so readily arouse that thought as the term sour.', 'If we remember how slowly and with what labour the appropriate ideas', 'follow unfamiliar words in another language, and how increasing', 'familiarity with such words brings greater rapidity and ease of', 'comprehension; and if we consider that the same process must have gone', 'on with the words of our mother tongue from childhood upwards, we shall', 'clearly see that the earliest learnt and oftenest used words, will,', 'other things equal, call up images with less loss of time and energy', 'than their later learnt synonyms.', '', 'Â§ 6. The further superiority possessed by Saxon English in its', 'comparative brevity, obviously comes under the same generalization. If', 'it be an advantage to express an idea in the smallest number of words,', 'then will it be an advantage to express it in the smallest number of', 'syllables. If circuitous phrases and needless expletives distract the', 'attention and diminish the strength of the impression produced, then', 'do surplus articulations do so. A certain effort, though commonly', 'an inappreciable one, must be required to recognize every vowel and', 'consonant. If, as all know, it is tiresome to listen to an indistinct', 'speaker, or read a badly-written manuscript; and if, as we cannot doubt,', 'the fatigue is a cumulative result of the attention needed to catch', 'successive syllables; it follows that attention is in such cases', 'absorbed by each syllable. And if this be true when the syllables are', 'difficult of recognition, it will also be true, though in a less degree,', 'when the recognition of them is easy. Hence, the shortness of Saxon', 'words becomes a reason for their greater force. One qualification,', 'however, must not be overlooked. A word which in itself embodies the', 'most important part of the idea to be conveyed, especially when that', 'idea is an emotional one, may often with advantage be a polysyllabic', 'word. Thus it seems more forcible to say, ""It is _magnificent,_""', 'than ""It is _grand._"" The word _vast_ is not so powerful a one as', '_stupendous._ Calling a thing _nasty_ is not so effective as calling it', '_disgusting._', '', 'Â§ 7. There seem to be several causes for this exceptional superiority', 'of certain long words. We may ascribe it partly to the fact that a', 'voluminous, mouth-filling epithet is, by its very size, suggestive of', 'largeness or strength; witness the immense pomposity of sesquipedalian', 'verbiage: and when great power or intensity has to be suggested, this', 'association of ideas aids the effect. A further cause may be that a', 'word of several syllables admits of more emphatic articulation; and as', 'emphatic articulation is a sign of emotion, the unusual impressiveness', 'of the thing named is implied by it. Yet another cause is that a long', 'word (of which the latter syllables are generally inferred as soon as', ""the first are spoken) allows the hearer's consciousness a longer time to"", 'dwell upon the quality predicated; and where, as in the above cases, it', 'is to this predicated quality that the entire attention is called, an', 'advantage results from keeping it before the mind for an appreciable', 'time. The reasons which we have given for preferring short words', 'evidently do not hold here. So that to make our generalization quite', 'correct we must say, that while in certain sentences expressing strong', 'feeling, the word which more especially implies that feeling may often', 'with advantage be a many-syllabled or Latin one; in the immense majority', 'of cases, each word serving but as a step to the idea embodied by the', 'whole sentence, should, if possible, be a one-syllabled or Saxon one.', '', 'Â§ 8. Once more, that frequent cause of strength in Saxon and other', 'primitive words-their imitative character may be similarly resolved into', 'the more general cause. Both those directly imitative, as _splash, bang,', 'whiz, roar,_ &c., and those analogically imitative, as _rough, smooth,', 'keen, blunt, thin, hard, crag,_ &c., have a greater or less likeness to', 'the things symbolized; and by making on the senses impressions allied to', 'the ideas to be called up, they save part of the effort needed to call', 'up such ideas, and leave more attention for the ideas themselves.', '', ""Â§ 9. The economy of the recipient's mental energy, into which are thus"", 'resolvable the several causes of the strength of Saxon English, may', 'equally be traced in the superiority of specific over generic words.', 'That concrete terms produce more vivid impressions than abstract ones,', 'and should, when possi']"

So, again, no animal or plant puts on its', 'perfect form at once, but all have to start from the same point,', 'however various the course which each has to pursue.  Not only men and', 'horses, and cats and dogs, lobsters and beetles, periwinkles and', 'mussels, but even the very sponges and animalcules commence their', 'existence under forms which are essentially undistinguishable; and this', 'is true of all the infinite variety of plants.

A man in his development runs for a little while parallel', 'with, though never passing through, the form of the meanest worm, then', 'travels for a space beside the fish, then journeys along with the bird', 'and the reptile for his fellow travellers; and only at last, after a', 'brief companionship with the highest of the four-footed and four-handed', 'world, rises into the dignity of pure manhood.

The white bear cannot', ""live where the tiger thrives, nor 'vice versa', and the more the"", 'natural habits of animal and vegetable species are examined, the more', 'do they seem, on the whole, limited to particular provinces.

And yet how, on this hypothesis, are we to', 'account for the absence of cattle in the Pampas of South America, when', 'those parts of the New World were discovered?  It is not that they were', 'unfit for cattle, for millions of cattle now run wild there; and the', 'like holds good of Australia and New Zealand.

So, again, no animal or plant puts on its', 'perfect form at once, but all have to start from the same point,', 'however various the course which each has to pursue.

But when Madame Heine, at', 'the end of twelve months, perceived that he was punctual at the', 'bank, and that his allowances, which, though moderate in England,', 'were handsome in Munich, carried him on without debt, she opened her', 'motherly arms and suggested to his mother and to himself, that he', 'should live with them.  In this way he also was domiciled up two', 'pairs of stairs in the palatial residence in the Ludwigs Strasse.', '', 'But all this happened long ago.  Isa Heine had been only seventeen', 'when her cousin had first come to Munich, and had made acquaintance', 'with him rather as a child than as a woman.  And when, as she', 'ripened into womanhood, this young man came more closely among them,', 'it did not strike her that the change would affect her more', 'powerfully than it would the others.  Her uncle and father, she', 'knew, had approved of Herbert at the bank; and Herbert had shown', 'that he could be steady; therefore he was to be taken into their', 'family, paying his annual subsidy, instead of being left with', 'strangers at the boarding-house.

Doctor Archibald Cameron, brother of the celebrated', 'Donald Cameron of Lochiel, attainted for the rebellion of 1745, was', 'found by a party of soldiers lurking with a comrade in the wilds of Loch', 'Katrine five or six years after the battle of Culloden, and was there', 'seized. There were circumstances in his case, so far as was made known', 'to the public, which attracted much compassion, and gave to the judicial', 'proceedings against him an appearance of cold-blooded revenge on the', 'part of government; and the following argument of a zealous Jacobite in', 'his favour, was received as conclusive by Dr. Johnson and other persons', 'who might pretend to impartiality. Dr. Cameron had never borne arms,', 'although engaged in the Rebellion, but used his medical skill for the', 'service, indifferently, of the wounded of both parties. His return to', 'Scotland was ascribed exclusively to family affairs. His behaviour at', 'the bar was decent, firm, and respectful. His wife threw herself, on', 'three different occasions, before George II and the members of his', 'family, was rudely repulsed from their presence, and at length placed,', 'it was said, in the same prison with her husband, and confined with', 'unmanly severity.', '', 'Dr. Cameron was finally executed with all the severities of the law of', 'treason; and his death remains in popular estimation a dark blot upon', 'the memory of George II, being almost publicly imputed to a mean and', ""personal hatred of Donald Cameron of Lochiel, the sufferer's heroic"", 'brother.', '', 'Yet the fact was that whether the execution of Archibald Cameron was', 'political or otherwise, it might certainly have been justified, had', ""the king's ministers so pleased, upon reasons of a public nature. The"", 'unfortunate sufferer had not come to the Highlands solely upon his', 'private affairs, as was the general belief; but it was not judged', 'prudent by the English ministry to let it be generally known that', 'he came to inquire about a considerable sum of money which had been', 'remitted from France to the friends of the exiled family. He had also a', ""commission to hold intercourse with the well-known M'Pherson of Cluny,"", 'chief of the clan Vourich, whom the Chevalier had left behind at his', 'departure from Scotland in 1746, and who remained during ten years of', 'proscription and danger, skulking from place to place in the Highlands,', 'and maintaining an uninterrupted correspondence between Charles and his', 'friends. That Dr. Cameron should have held a commission to assist this', 'chief in raking together the dispersed embers of disaffection, is in', 'itself sufficiently natural, and, considering his political principles,', 'in no respect dishonourable to his memory. But neither ought it to be', 'imputed to George II that he suffered the laws to be enforced against', 'a person taken in the act of breaking them. When he lost his hazardous', 'game, Dr. Cameron only paid the forfeit which he must have calculated', ""upon. The ministers, however, thought it proper to leave Dr. Cameron's"", 'new schemes in concealment, lest, by divulging them, they had indicated', 'the channel of communication which, it is now well known, they possessed', 'to all the plots of Charles Edward. But it was equally ill advised and', 'ungenerous to sacrifice the character of the king to the policy of the', 'administration. Both points might have been gained by sparing the', 'life of Dr. Cameron after conviction, and limiting his punishment to', 'perpetual exile.', '', 'These repeated and successive Jacobite plots rose and burst like bubbles', 'on a fountain; and one of them, at least, the Chevalier judged of', 'importance enough to induce him to risk himself within the dangerous', ""precincts of the British capital. This appears from Dr. King's ANECDOTES"", 'OF HIS OWN TIMES.', '', ""'September, 1750.--I received a note from my Lady Primrose, who desired"", 'to see me immediately. As soon as I waited on her, she led me into her', ""dressing-room, and presented me to--' [the Chevalier, doubtless]. 'If"", 'I was surprised to find him there, I was still more astonished when he', 'acquainted me with the motives which had induced him to hazard a journey', 'to England at this juncture.

The third part,', 'although it appeared under the same title, namely â\x80\x98Fairy Legends and', 'Traditions of the South of Ireland,â\x80\x99 may be considered as forming almost', 'a separate work, inasmuch as it comprised the fairy superstitions of', 'Wales and other countries, in addition to those current in Ireland.

When I', 'was introduced to the â\x80\x98Great Unknownâ\x80\x99 I really had not the power of', 'speaking; it was a strange feeling of embarrassment, which I do not', 'remember having felt before in so strong a manner; and of course to his', 'â\x80\x98I am glad to see you, Mr. Croker, you and I are not unknown to each', 'other,â\x80\x99 I could say nothing.

We met', 'priests in three-cornered hats, long frock-coats, and knee-breeches; also', 'soldiers and gendarmes, and peasants and children, clattering over the', 'pavements in wooden shoes.', '', 'It makes a great impression of outlandishness to see the signs over the', 'shop doors in a foreign tongue.

The impression the', 'latter gives is of magnitude and mass; this French cathedral strikes one', 'as lofty.  The exterior is venerable, though but little time-worn by the', 'action of the atmosphere; and statues still keep their places in numerous', 'niches, almost as perfect as when first placed there in the thirteenth', 'century.  The principal doors are deep, elaborately wrought, pointed', 'arches; and the interior seemed to us, at the moment, as grand as any', 'that we had seen, and to afford as vast an idea of included space; it', 'being of such an airy height, and with no screen between the chancel and', 'nave, as in all the English cathedrals.  We saw the differences, too,', 'betwixt a church in which the same form of worship for which it was', 'originally built is still kept up, and those of England, where it has', 'been superseded for centuries; for here, in the recess of every arch of', 'the side aisles, beneath each lofty window, there was a chapel dedicated', 'to some Saint, and adorned with great marble sculptures of the', 'crucifixion, and with pictures, execrably bad, in all cases, and various', 'kinds of gilding and ornamentation.  Immensely tall wax candles stand', 'upon the altars of these chapels, and before one sat a woman, with a', 'great supply of tapers, one of which was burning.  I suppose these were', 'to be lighted as offerings to the saints, by the true believers.', 'Artificial flowers were hung at some of the shrines, or placed under', 'glass.  In every chapel, moreover, there was a confessional,--a little', 'oaken structure, about as big as a sentry-box, with a closed part for the', 'priest to sit in, and an open one for the penitent to kneel at, and', ""speak, through the open-work of the priest's closet.  Monuments, mural"", 'and others, to long-departed worthies, and images of the Saviour, the', 'Virgin, and saints, were numerous everywhere about the church; and in the', 'chancel there was a great deal of quaint and curious sculpture, fencing', 'in the Holy of Holies, where the High Altar stands.  There is not much', 'painted glass; one or two very rich and beautiful rose-windows, however,', 'that looked antique; and the great eastern window which, I think, is', 'modern.  The pavement has, probably, never been renewed, as one piece of', 'work, since the structure was erected, and is foot-worn by the successive', 'generations, though still in excellent repair.  I saw one of the small,', 'square stones in it, bearing the date of 1597, and no doubt there are a', 'thousand older ones.  It was gratifying to find the cathedral in such', 'good condition, without any traces of recent repair; and it is perhaps a', 'mark of difference between French and English character, that the', 'Revolution in the former country, though all religious worship disappears', 'before it, does not seem to have caused such violence to ecclesiastical', 'monuments, as the Reformation and the reign of Puritanism in the latter.', 'I did not see a mutilated shrine, or even a broken-nosed image, in the', 'whole cathedral.  But, probably, the very rage of the English fanatics', 'against idolatrous tokens, and their smashing blows at them, were', 'symptoms of sincerer religious faith than the French were capable of.', 'These last did not care enough about their Saviour to beat down his', 'crucified image; and they preserved the works of sacred art, for the sake', 'only of what beauty there was in them.', '', 'While we were in the cathedral, we saw several persons kneeling at their', 'devotions on the steps of the chancel and elsewhere.

These are', 'termed ""organs,"" and the whole together is called ""organic."" And as it', 'is universally characteristic of them, this term ""organic"" has been very', 'conveniently employed to denote the whole of living nature,--the whole', 'of the plant world, and the whole of the animal world.', '', 'Few animals can be more familiar to you than that whose skeleton is', 'shown on our diagram. You need not bother yourselves with this ""Equus', 'caballus"" written under it; that is only the Latin name of it, and does', 'not make it any better. It simply means the common Horse. Suppose we', 'wish to understand all about the Horse. Our first object must be to', 'study the structure of the animal. The whole of his body is inclosed', 'within a hide, a skin covered with hair; and if that hide or skin be', 'taken off, we find a great mass of flesh, or what is technically called', 'muscle, being the substance which by its power of contraction enables', 'the animal to move. These muscles move the hard parts one upon the', 'other, and so give that strength and power of motion which renders the', 'Horse so useful to us in the performance of those services in which we', 'employ him.', '', 'And then, on separating and removing the whole of this skin and flesh,', 'you have a great series of bones, hard structures, bound together with', 'ligaments, and forming the skeleton which is represented here.', '', '[Illustration: FIGURE 1. (Section through a horse.)]', '', '[Illustration: FIGURE 2. (Section through a cell.)]', '', 'In that skeleton there are a number of parts to be recognized. The long', 'series of bones, beginning from the skull and ending in the tail, is', 'called the spine, and those in front are the ribs; and then there are', 'two pairs of limbs, one before and one behind; and there are what we', 'all know as the fore-legs and the hind-legs. If we pursue our researches', 'into the interior of this animal, we find within the framework of', 'the skeleton a great cavity, or rather, I should say, two great', 'cavities,--one cavity beginning in the skull and running through the', 'neck-bones, along the spine, and ending in the tail, containing the', 'brain and the spinal marrow, which are extremely important organs. The', 'second great cavity, commencing with the mouth, contains the gullet,', 'the stomach, the long intestine, and all the rest of those internal', 'apparatus which are essential for digestion; and then in the same great', 'cavity, there are lodged the heart and all the great vessels going from', 'it; and, besides that, the organs of respiration--the lungs: and then', 'the kidneys, and the organs of reproduction, and so on. Let us now', 'endeavour to reduce this notion of a horse that we now have, to', 'some such kind of simple expression as can be at once, and without', 'difficulty, retained in the mind, apart from all minor details. If', 'I make a transverse section, that is, if I were to saw a dead horse', 'across, I should find that, if I left out the details, and supposing I', 'took my section through the anterior region, and through the fore-limbs,', 'I should have here this kind of section of the body (Fig. 1). Here would', 'be the upper part of the animal--that great mass of bones that we spoke', 'of as the spine (a, Fig. 1). Here I should have the alimentary canal', '(b, Fig. 1). Here I should have the heart (c, Fig. 1); and then you see,', 'there would be a kind of double tube, the whole being inclosed within', 'the hide; the spinal marrow would be placed in the upper tube (a, Fig.', '1), and in the lower tube (d d, Fig. 1), there would be the alimentary', 'canal (b), and the heart (c); and here I shall have the legs proceeding', ""from each side. For simplicity's sake, I represent them merely as stumps"", '(e e, Fig. 1). Now that is a horse--as mathematicians would say--reduced', 'to its most simple expression. Carry that in your minds, if you please,', 'as a simplified idea of the structure of the Horse. The considerations', 'which I have now put before you belong to what we technically call the', ""'Anatomy' of the Horse. Now, suppose we go to work upon these several"", 'parts,--flesh and hair, and skin and bone, and lay open these', 'various organs with our scalpels, and examine them by means of our', 'magnifying-glasses, and see what we can make of them. We shall find that', 'the flesh is made up of bundles of strong fibres. The brain and nerves,', 'too, we shall find, are made up of fibres, and these queer-looking', 'things that are called ganglionic corpuscles. If we take a slice of the', 'bone and examine it, we shall find that it is very like this diagram', 'of a section of the bone of an ostrich, though differing, of course,', 'in some details; and if we take any part whatsoever of the tissue, and', 'examine it, we shall find it all has a minute structure, visible only', 'under the microscope. All these parts constitute microscopic anatomy', ""or 'Histology.' These parts are constantly being changed; every part is"", 'constantly growing, decaying, and being replaced during the life of the', 'animal. The tissue is constantly replaced by new material; and if you go', 'back to the young state of the tissue in the case of muscle, or in the', 'case of skin, or any of the organs I have mentioned, you will find that', 'they all come under the same condition.

Dr. Cameron had never borne arms,', 'although engaged in the Rebellion, but used his medical skill for the', 'service, indifferently, of the wounded of both parties. His return to', 'Scotland was ascribed exclusively to family affairs. His behaviour at', 'the bar was decent, firm, and respectful.

The"", 'unfortunate sufferer had not come to the Highlands solely upon his', 'private affairs, as was the general belief; but it was not judged', 'prudent by the English ministry to let it be generally known that', 'he came to inquire about a considerable sum of money which had been', 'remitted from France to the friends of the exiled family. He had also a', ""commission to hold intercourse with the well-known M'Pherson of Cluny,"", 'chief of the clan Vourich, whom the Chevalier had left behind at his', 'departure from Scotland in 1746, and who remained during ten years of', 'proscription and danger, skulking from place to place in the Highlands,', 'and maintaining an uninterrupted correspondence between Charles and his', 'friends. That Dr. Cameron should have held a commission to assist this', 'chief in raking together the dispersed embers of disaffection, is in', 'itself sufficiently natural, and, considering his political principles,', 'in no respect dishonourable to his memory. But neither ought it to be', 'imputed to George II that he suffered the laws to be enforced against', 'a person taken in the act of breaking them.

This appears from Dr. King's ANECDOTES"", 'OF HIS OWN TIMES.', '', ""'September, 1750.--I received a note from my Lady Primrose, who desired"", 'to see me immediately.

He understood how to improve the opportunities which civil war', 'afforded, of advancing his fortune, by a dexterous use of his capital;', 'and he was not at a loss to perceive that these were likely to be', ""obtained in joining the Parliament; while the King's cause, as it was"", 'managed, held out nothing to the wealthy but a course of exaction', 'and compulsory loans. For these reasons, Bridgenorth became a decided', 'Roundhead, and all friendly communication betwixt his neighbour and him', 'was abruptly broken asunder. This was done with the less acrimony, that,', 'during the Civil War, Sir Geoffrey was almost constantly in the field,', 'following the vacillating and unhappy fortunes of his master; while', 'Major Bridgenorth, who soon renounced active military service, resided', 'chiefly in London, and only occasionally visited the Hall.', '', 'Upon these visits, it was with great pleasure he received the', 'intelligence, that Lady Peveril had shown much kindness to Mrs.', 'Bridgenorth, and had actually given her and her family shelter in', 'Martindale Castle, when Moultrassie Hall was threatened with pillage by', ""a body of Prince Rupert's ill-disciplined Cavaliers. This acquaintance"", 'had been matured by frequent walks together, which the vicinity of', 'their places of residence suffered the Lady Peveril to have with Mrs.', 'Bridgenorth, who deemed herself much honoured in being thus admitted', 'into the society of so distinguished a lady. Major Bridgenorth heard of', 'this growing intimacy with great pleasure, and he determined to repay', 'the obligation, as far as he could without much hurt to himself,', 'by interfering with all his influence, in behalf of her unfortunate', ""husband. It was chiefly owing to Major Bridgenorth's mediation, that Sir"", ""Geoffrey's life was saved after the battle of Worcester. He obtained him"", 'permission to compound for his estate on easier terms than many who had', 'been less obstinate in malignancy; and, finally, when, in order to', 'raise the money to the composition, the Knight was obliged to sell a', 'considerable portion of his patrimony, Major Bridgenorth became the', 'purchaser, and that at a larger price than had been paid to any', 'Cavalier under such circumstances, by a member of the Committee for', 'Sequestrations. It is true, the prudent committeeman did not, by any', 'means, lose sight of his own interest in the transaction, for the', 'price was, after all, very moderate, and the property lay adjacent', 'to Moultrassie Hall, the value of which was at least trebled by the', 'acquisition. But then it was also true, that the unfortunate owner must', 'have submitted to much worse conditions, had the committeeman used,', 'as others did, the full advantages which his situation gave him; and', 'Bridgenorth took credit to himself, and received it from others,', 'for having, on this occasion, fairly sacrificed his interest to his', 'liberality.', '', 'Sir Geoffrey Peveril was of the same opinion, and the rather that Mr.', 'Bridgenorth seemed to bear his exaltation with great moderation, and', 'was disposed to show him personally the same deference in his present', 'sunshine of prosperity, which he had exhibited formerly in their early', 'acquaintance. It is but justice to Major Bridgenorth to observe, that', 'in this conduct he paid respect as much to the misfortunes as to the', 'pretensions of his far-descended neighbour, and that, with the frank', 'generosity of a blunt Englishman, he conceded points of ceremony, about', 'which he himself was indifferent, merely because he saw that his doing', 'so gave pleasure to Sir Geoffrey.', '', ""Peveril of the Peak did justice to his neighbour's delicacy, in"", 'consideration of which he forgot many things.

Among the various characteristics of the age in which we live, as', 'compared with other ages of this not yet _very_ experienced world, one', 'of the most notable appears to me to be the just and wholesome contempt', 'in which we hold poverty. I repeat, the _just_ and _wholesome_ contempt;', 'though I see that some of my hearers look surprised at the expression. I', 'assure them, I use it in sincerity; and I should not have ventured to', 'ask you to listen to me this evening, unless I had entertained a', 'profound respect for wealth--true wealth, that is to say; for, of', 'course, we ought to respect neither wealth nor anything else that is', 'false of its kind: and the distinction between real and false wealth is', 'one of the points on which I shall have a few words presently to say to', 'you. But true wealth I hold, as I said, in great honour; and sympathize,', 'for the most part, with that extraordinary feeling of the present age', 'which publicly pays this honour to riches.', '', '', '2. I cannot, however, help noticing how extraordinary it is, and how', 'this epoch of ours differs from all bygone epochs in having no', 'philosophical nor religious worshippers of the ragged godship of', 'poverty. In the classical ages, not only were there people who', 'voluntarily lived in tubs, and who used gravely to maintain the', 'superiority of tub-life to town-life, but the Greeks and Latins seem to', 'have looked on these eccentric, and I do not scruple to say, absurd', 'people, with as much respect as we do upon large capitalists and landed', 'proprietors; so that really, in those days, no one could be described as', 'purse proud, but only as empty-purse proud. And no less distinct than', 'the honour which those curious Greek people pay to their conceited poor,', 'is the disrespectful manner in which they speak of the rich; so that', 'one cannot listen long either to them, or to the Roman writers who', 'imitated them, without finding oneself entangled in all sorts of', 'plausible absurdities; hard upon being convinced of the uselessness of', 'collecting that heavy yellow substance which we call gold, and led', 'generally to doubt all the most established maxims of political economy.', '', '', '3. Nor are matters much better in the Middle Ages. For the Greeks and', 'Romans contented themselves with mocking at rich people, and', 'constructing merry dialogues between Charon and Diogenes or Menippus, in', 'which the ferryman and the cynic rejoiced together as they saw kings and', 'rich men coming down to the shore of Acheron, in lamenting and', 'lamentable crowds, casting their crowns into the dark waters, and', 'searching, sometimes in vain, for the last coin out of all their', 'treasures that could ever be of use to them.', '', '', '4. But these Pagan views of the matter were indulgent, compared with', 'those which were held in the Middle Ages, when wealth seems to have been', 'looked upon by the best men not only as contemptible, but as criminal.', 'The purse round the neck is, then, one of the principal signs of', 'condemnation in the pictured Inferno; and the Spirit of Poverty is', 'reverenced with subjection of heart, and faithfulness of affection, like', 'that of a loyal knight for his lady, or a loyal subject for his queen.', 'And truly, it requires some boldness to quit ourselves of these', 'feelings, and to confess their partiality or their error, which,', 'nevertheless, we are certainly bound to do. For wealth is simply one of', 'the greatest powers which can be entrusted to human hands: a power, not', 'indeed to be envied, because it seldom makes us happy; but still less to', 'be abdicated or despised; while, in these days, and in this country, it', 'has become a power all the more notable, in that the possessions of a', 'rich man are not represented, as they used to be, by wedges of gold or', 'coffers of jewels, but by masses of men variously employed, over whose', 'bodies and minds the wealth, according to its direction, exercises', 'harmful or helpful influence, and becomes, in that alternative, Mammon', 'either of Unrighteousness or of Righteousness.', '', '', '5. Now, it seemed to me that since, in the name you have given to this', 'great gathering of British pictures, you recognize them as', 'Treasures--that is, I suppose, as part and parcel of the real wealth of', 'the country--you might not be uninterested in tracing certain commercial', 'questions connected with this particular form of wealth.

It was a dark little tale about a man who found a magic cup and learned that if he wept into the cup, his tears turned into pearls. But even though he had always been poor, he was a happy man and rarely shed a tear. So he found ways to make himself sad so that his tears could make him rich. As the pearls piled up, so did his greed grow.

1,2001,Life of pi,5,"I know a woman here in Toronto who is very dear to my heart. She was my foster mother. I call her Auntieji and she likes that. She is Quebecoise. Though she has lived in Toronto for over thirty years, her French-speaking mind still slips on occasion on the understanding of English sounds. And so, when she first heard of Hare Krishnas, she didn't hear right. She heard ""Hairless Christians"", and that is what they were to her for many years. When I corrected her, I told her that in fact she was not so wrong; that Hindus, in their capacity for love, are indeed hairless Christians, just as Muslims, in the way they see God in everything, are bearded Hindus, and Christians, in their devotion to God, are hat-wearing Muslims."
2,2003,The da vinci code,5,"Sophie stopped the taxi at an imposing gate that blocked the bank’s driveway—a cement-lined ramp that descended beneath the building. A video camera overhead was aimed directly at them, and Langdon had the feeling that this camera, unlike those at the Louvre, was authentic. Sophie rolled down the window and surveyed the electronic podium on the driver’s side. An LCD screen provided directions in seven languages. Topping the list was English."
3,2003,The curious incident of the dog in the night,5,"A lie is when you say something happened which didn't happen. But there is only ever one thing which happened at a particular time and a particular place. And there are an infinite number of things which didn't happen at that time and that place. And if I think about something which didn't happen I start thinking about all the other things which didn't happen.
For example, this morning for breakfast I had Ready Brek and some hot raspberry milkshake. But if I say that I actually had Shreddies and a mug of tea I start thinking about Coco-Pops and lemonade and Porridge and Dr Pepper and how I wasn't eating my breakfast in Egypt and there wasn't a rhinoceros in the room and Father wasn't wearing a diving suit and so on and even writing this makes me feel shaky and scared, like I do when I'm standing on the top of a very tall building and there are thousands of houses and cars and people below me and my head is so full of all these things that I'm afraid that I'm going to forget to stand up straight and hang onto the rail and I'm going to fall over and be killed."
4,2005,Twilight,5,"I didn't see him leap me - it was much too fast. I only found myself suddenly airborne, and then we crashed onto the sofa, knocking it into the wall. All the while, his arms formed an iron cage of protection around me - I was barely jostled. But I still was gasping as I tried to right myself. He wasn't having that. He curled me into a ball against his chest, holding me more securely than iron chains. I glared at him in alarm, but he seemed well in control, his jaw relaxed as he grinned, his eyes bright only with humor."
5,2001,Atonement,5,"Now and then, an inch below the water's surface, the muscles of his stomach tightened involuntarily as he recalled another detail. A drop of water on her upper arm. Wet. An embroidered flower, a simple daisy, sewn between the cups of her bra. Her breasts wide apart and small. On her back, a mole half covered by a strap. When she climbed out of the pond a glimpse of the triangular darkness her knickers were supposed to conceal. Wet. He saw it, he made himself see it again. The way her pelvic bones stretched the material clear of the skin, the deep curve of her waist, her startling whiteness. When she reached for her skirt, a carelessly raised foot revealed a patch of soil on each pad of her sweetly diminished toes. Another mole the size of a farthing on her thigh and something purplish on her calf--a strawberry mark, a scar. Not blemishes. Adornments."
6,2005,never let me go,5,"That was the only time, as I stood there, looking at that strange rubbish, feeling the wind coming across those empty fields, that I started to imagine just a little fantasy thing, because this was Norfolk after all, and it was only a couple of weeks since I’d lost him. I was thinking about the rubbish, the flapping plastic in the branches, the shore-line of odd stuff caught along the fencing, and I half-closed my eyes and imagined this was the spot where everything I'd ever lost since my childhood had washed up, and I was now standing here in front of it, and if I waited long enough, a tiny figure would appear on the horizon across the field, and gradually get larger until I'd see it was Tommy, and he'd wave, maybe even call. The fantasy never got beyond that --I didn't let it-- and though the tears rolled down my face, I wasn't sobbing or out of control. I just waited a bit, then turned back to the car, to drive off to wherever it was I was supposed to be."

I'd like to have at my disposal complicated hybrid emotions, Germanic train-car constructions like, say, ""the happiness that attends disaster."" Or: ""the disappointment of sleeping with one's fantasy."" I'd like to show how ""intimations of mortality brought on by aging family members"" connects with ""the hatred of mirrors that begins in middle age.""

9,1999,the white teeth ,5,"It's a funny thing about the modern world. You hear girls in the toilets of clubs saying, ""Yeah, he fucked off and left me. He didn't love me. He just couldn't deal with love. He was too fucked up to know how to love me."" Now, how did that happen? What was it about this unlovable century that convinced us we were, despite everything, eminently lovable as a people, as a species? What made us think that anyone who fails to love us is damaged, lacking, malfunctioning in some way? And particularly if they replace us with a god, or a weeping madonna, or the face of Christ in a ciabatta roll---then we call them crazy. Deluded. Regressive. We are so convinced of the goodness of ourselves, and the goodness of our love, we cannot bear to believe that there might be something more worthy of love than us, more worthy of worship. Greeting cards routinely tell us everybody deserves love. No. Everybody deserves clean water. Not everybody deserves love all the time."
10,2000,the amber spyglass,5,"I will love you forever; whatever happens. Till I die and after I die, and when I find my way out of the land of the dead, I’ll drift about forever, all my atoms, till I find you again… I’ll be looking for you, every moment, every single moment. And when we do find each other again, we’ll cling together so tight that nothing and no one’ll ever tear us apart. Every atom of me and every atom of you… We’ll live in birds and flowers and dragonflies and pine trees and in clouds and in those little specks of light you see floating in sunbeams… And when they use our atoms to make new lives, they won’t just be able to take one, they’ll have to take two, one of you and one of me, we’ll be joined so tight…"
11,2003,a sorty history,5,"Thanks to ten minutes or so of balmy weather, by 10:24 the Earth is covered in the great carboniferous forests whose residues give us all our coal, and the first winged insects are evident. Dinosaurs plod onto the scene just before 11 P.M. and hold sway for about three-quarters of an hour. At twenty-one minutes to midnight they vanish and the age of mammals begins. Humans emerge one minute and seventeen seconds before midnight. The whole of our recorded history, on this scale, would be no more than a few seconds, a single human lifetime barely an instant. Throughout this greatly speeded-up day continents slide about and bang together at a clip that seems positively reckless. Mountains rise and melt away, ocean basins come and go, ice sheets advance and withdraw. And throughout the whole, about three times every minute, somewhere on the planet there is a flash-bulb pop of light marking the impact of a Manson-sized meteor or one even larger. It's a wonder that anything at all can survive in such a pummeled and unsettled environment. In fact, not many things do for long"
12,2008,the white tiger,5,"Me, and thousands of others in this country like me, are half-baked, because we were never allowed to complete our schooling. Open our skulls, look in with a penlight, and you'll find an odd museum of ideas: sentences of history or mathematics remembered from school textbooks (no boy remembers his schooling like the one who was taken out of school, let me assure you), sentences about politics read in a newspaper while waiting for someone to come to an office, triangles and pyramids seen on the torn pages of the old geometry textbooks which every tea shop in this country uses to wrap its snacks in, bits of All India Radio news bulletins, things that drop into your mind, like lizards from the ceiling, in the half hour before falling asleep--all these ideas, half formed and half digested and half correct, mix up with other half-cooked ideas in your head, and I guess these half-formed ideas bugger one another, and make more half-formed ideas, and this is what you act on and live with."
13,2004,cloud atlas,5,"Belief, like fear or love, is a force to be understood as we understand the theory of relativity and principals of uncertainty. Phenomena that determine the course of our lives. Yesterday, my life was headed in one direction. Today, it is headed in another. Yesterday, I believe I would never have done what I did today. These forces that often remake time and space, that can shape and alter who we imagine ourselves to be, begin long before we are born and continue after we perish. Our lives and our choices, like quantum trajectories, are understood moment to moment. That each point of intersection, each encounter, suggest a new potential direction. Proposition, I have fallen in love with Luisa Rey. Is this possible? I just met her and yet, I feel like something important has happened to me."
14,2006,the god delision,5,"Let us remind ourselves of the terminology. A theist believes in a supernatural intelligence who, in addition to his main work of creating the universe in the first place, is still around to oversee and influence the subsequent fate of his initial creation. In many theistic belief systems, the deity is intimately involved in human affairs. He answers prayers; forgives or punishes sins; intervenes in the world by performing miracles; frets about good and bad deeds, and knows when we do them (or even think about doing them). A deist, too, believes in a supernatural intelligence, but one whose activities were confined to setting up the laws that govern the universe in the first place. The deist God never intervenes thereafter, and certainly has no specific interest in human affairs. Pantheists don't believe in a supernatural God at all, but use the word God as a non-supernatural synonym for Nature, or for the Universe, or for the lawfulness that governs its workings. Deists differ from theists in that their God does not answer prayers, is not interested in sins or confessions, does not read our thoughts and does not intervene with capricious miracles. Deists differ from pantheists in that the deist God is some kind of cosmic intelligence, rather than the pantheist's metaphoric or poetic synonym for the laws of the universe. Pantheism is sexed-up atheism. Deism is watered-down theism."
15,1993,the giver,5,"Lily appeared, wearing her nightclothes, in the doorway. She gave an impatient sigh. 'This is certainly a very LONG private conversation,' she said. 'And there are certain people waiting for their comfort object.' Lily,' her mother said fondly, 'you're very close to being an Eight, and when you're an Eight, your comfort object will be taken away. It will be recycled to the younger children. You should be starting to go off to sleep without it.' But her father had already gone to the shelf and taken down the stuffed elephant which was kept there. Many of the comfort objects, like Lily's, were soft, stuffed, imaginary creatures. Jonas's had been called a bear. Here you are, Lily-billy,' he said. 'I'll come help you remove your hair ribbons."
16,1997,memoirsa of a geisha,5,"To the eyes of the American soldiers who drove past, I looked no different from the women around me; and as I thought of it, who could say I was any different? If you no longer have leaves, or bark, or roots, can you go on calling yourself a tree? ""I am a peasant,"" I said to myself, ""and not a geisha at all any longer."" It was a frightening feeling to look at my hands and see their roughness. To draw my mind away from my fears, I turned my attention again to the truckloads of soldiers driving past. Weren't these the very American soldiers we'd been taught to hate, who had bombed our cities with such horrifying weapons? Now they rode through our neighborhood, throwing pieces of candy to the children."
17,1995,the golden compass,5,"You are so young, Lyra, too young to understand this, but I shall tell you anyway and you'll understand it later: men pass in front of our eyes like butterflies, creatures of a brief season. We love them; they are brave, proud, beautiful, clever; and they die almost at once. They die so soon that our hearts are continually racked with pain. We bear their children, who are witches if they are female, human if not; and then in the blink of an eye they are gone, felled, slain, lost. Our sons, too. When a little boy is growing, he thinks he is immortal. His mother knows he isn't. Each time becomes more painful, until finally your heart is broken. Perhaps that is when Yambe-Akka comes for you. She is older than the tundra. Perhaps, for her, witches' lives are as brief as men's are to us."
18,1998,the poison wood bible,5,"But his kind will always lose in the end. I know this, and now I know why. Whether it's wife or nation they occupy, their mistake is the same: they stand still, and their stake moves underneath them.... Chains rattle, rivers roll, animals startle and bolt, forests inspire and expand, babies stretch open-mouthed from the womb, new seedlings arch their necks and creep forward into the light. Even a language won't stand still. A territory is only possessed for a moment in time. They stake everything on that moment, posing for photographs while planting the flag, casting themselves in bronze.... Even before the flagpole begins to peel and splinter, the ground underneath arches and slides forward into its own new destiny. It may bear the marks of boots on its back, but those marks become the possessions of the land."
19,1999,the perks of being a wallflower,5,"It's much easier to not know things sometimes. Things change and friends leave. And life doesn't stop for anybody. I wanted to laugh. Or maybe get mad. Or maybe shrug at how strange everybody was, especially me. I think the idea is that every person has to live for his or her own life and than make the choice to share it with other people. You can't just sit their and put everybody's lives ahead of yours and think that counts as love. You just can't. You have to do things. I'm going to do what I want to do. I'm going to be who I really am. And I'm going to figure out what that is. And we could all sit around and wonder and feel bad about each other and blame a lot of people for what they did or didn't do or what they didn't know. I don't know. I guess there could always be someone to blame. It's just different. Maybe it's good to put things in perspective, but sometimes, I think that the only perspective is to really be there. Because it's okay to feel things. I was really there. And that was enough to make me feel infinite. I feel infinite."

Stanley turned to see Mr. Sir holding the boy’s head against the oatmeal pot. “Is something wrong with my face?” The boy tried to speak but couldn’t. Mr. Sir had him by the throat. “Does anyone see anything wrong with my face?” asked Mr. Sir, as he continued to choke the boy. Nobody said anything. Mr. Sir let the boy go. His head banged against the table as he fell to the ground. Mr. Sir stood over him and asked, “How does my face look to you now?” A gurgling sound came out of the boy’s mouth, then he managed to gasp the word, “Fine.” “I’m kind of handsome, don’t you think?” “Yes, Mr. Sir.” Out"
21,1996,angelas ashes,5,"Anytime Jesus got hungry all He had to do was go up the road to a fig tree or an orange tree and have His fill. If He wanted a pint He could wave His hand over a big glass and there was the pint. Or He could visit Mary Magdalene and her sister, Martha, and they'd give Him His dinner no questions asked and He'd get his feet washed and dried with Mary Magdalene's hair while Martha washed the dishes, which I don't think is fair. Why should she have to wash the dishes while her sister sits out there chatting away with Our Lord? It's a good thing Jesus decided to be born Jewish in that warm place because if he was born in Limerick he'd catch the consumption and be dead in a month and there wouldn't be any Catholic Church and there wouldn't be any Communion or Confirmation and we wouldn't have to learn the catechism and write compositions about Him."
22,1996,fight club,5,"You have a class of young strong men and women, and they want to give their lives to something. Advertising has these people chasing cars and clothes they don't need. Generations have been working in jobs they hate, just so they can buy what they don't really need. We don't have a great war in our generation, or a great depression, but we do, we have a great war of the spirit. We have a great revolution against the culture. The great depression is our lives. We have a spiritual depression"
23,1999,girl with a pearl earring,5,"I had not yet been down to the cellar where I was to sleep. I took a candle with me but was too tired to look around beyond finding a bed, pillow and blanket. Leaving the trap door of the cellar open so that cool, fresh air could reach me, I took off my shoes, cap, apron and dress, prayed briefly, and lay down. I was about to blow out the candle when I noticed the painting hanging at the foot of my bed. I sat up, wide awake now. It was another picture of Christ on the Cross, smaller than the one upstairs but even more disturbing. Christ had thrown his head back in pain, and Mary Magdalene’s eyes were rolling. I Iay back gingerly, unable to take my eyes off it. I could not imagine sleeping in the room with the painting. I wanted to take it down but did not dare. Finally I blew out the candle—I could not afford to waste candles on my first day in the new house. I lay back again, my eyes fixed to the place where I knew the painting hung. I slept badly that night, tired as I was. I woke often and looked for the painting. Though I could see nothing on the wall, every detail was fixed in my mind. Finally, when it was beginning to grow light, the painting appeared again and I was sure the Virgin Mary was looking down at me."
24,1996,bridget jones diary,5,"Being a woman is worse than being a farmer there is so much harvesting and crop spraying to be done: legs to be waxed, underarms shaved, eyebrows plucked, feet pumiced, skin exfoliated and moisturised, spots cleansed, roots dyed, eyelashes tinted, nails filed, cellulite massaged, stomach muscles exercised. The whole performance is so highly tuned you only need to neglect it for a few days for the whole thing to go to seed. Sometimes I wonder what I would be like if left to revert to nature — with a full beard and handlebar moustache on each shin Dennis Healey eyebrows face a graveyard of dead skin cells spots erupting long curly fingernails like Struwelpeter blind as bat and stupid runt of species as no contact lenses flabby body flobbering around.

25,1992,the secret history,5,"ery Greek idea, and a very profound one. Beauty is terror. Whatever we call beautiful, we quiver before it. And what could be more terrifying and beautiful, to souls like the Greeks or our own, than to lose control completely? To throw off the chains of being for an instant, to shatter the accident of our mortal selves? Euripides speaks of the Maenads: head thrown I back, throat to the stars, ""more like deer than human being."" To be absolutely free! One is quite capable, of course, of working out these destructive passions in more vulgar and less efficient ways. But how glorious to release them in a single burst! To sing, to scream, to dance barefoot in the woods in the dead of night, with no more awareness of mortality than an animal! These are powerful mysteries. The bellowing of bulls. Springs of honey bubbling from the ground. If we are strong enough in our souls we can rip away the veil and look that naked, terrible beauty right in the face; let God consume us, devour us, unstring our bones. Then spit us out reborn"
26,1990,jurassic park,5,"But now science is the belief system that is hundreds of years old. And, like the medieval system before it, science is starting not to fit the world any more. Science has attained so much power that its practical limits begin to be apparent. Largely through science, billions of us live in one small world, densely packed and intercommunicating. But science cannot help us decide what to do with that world, or how to live. Science can make a nuclear reactor, but it cannot tell us not to build it. Science can make pesticide, but cannot tell us not to use it. And our world starts to seem polluted in fundamental ways---air, and water, and land---because of ungovernable science"

You’ll have no wife, nor will you ever hold a child of your own blood in your arms. Robb will rule, you will serve. Men will call you a crow. Him they’ll call `Your Grace’.

Because he rather liked people. It was major failing in a demon. Oh, he did his best to make their short lives miserable, because that was his job, but nothing he could think up was half as bad as the stuff they thought up themselves. They seemed to have a talent for it. It was built into the design, somehow. They were born into a world that was against them in a thousand little ways, and then devoted most of their energies to making it worse. Over the years Crowley had found it increasingly difficult to find anything demonic to do which showed up against the natural background of generalized nastiness. There had been times, over the past millennium, when he’d felt like sending a message back Below saying, Look we may as well give up right now, we might as well shut down Dis and Pandemonium and everywhere and move up here, there’s nothing we can do to them that they don’t do to themselves and they do things we’ve never even thought of, often involving electrodes.

To children, the world and everything in it is new, something that gives rise to astonishment. It is not like that for adults. Most adults accept the world as a matter of course. This is precisely where philosophers are a notable exception. A philosopher never gets quite used to the world. To him or her, the world continues to seem a bit unreasonable - bewildering, even enigmatic. Philosophers and small children thus have an important faculty in common. The only thing we require to be good philosophers is the faculty of won"

We believed in it, this downward motion: so lovely, like flying, and yet at the same time so dire, so extreme, so unlikely. God is love, they once said, but we reversed that, and love, like heaven, was always just around the corner. The more difficult it was to love the particular man beside us, the more we believed in Love, abstract and total. We were waiting, always, for the incarnation. That word, made flesh. And sometimes it happened, for a time. That kind of love comes and goes and is hard to remember afterwards, like pain. You would look at the man one day and you would think, I loved you, and the tense would be past, and you would be filled with a sense of wonder, because it was such an amazing and precarious and dumb thing to have done; and you would know too why your friends had been evasive about it, at the time"
32,1983,pet semeatary,5,"t's probably wrong to believe there can be any limit to the horror which the human mind can experience. On the contrary, it seems that some exponential effect begins to obtain as deeper and deeper darkness falls-as little as one may like to admit it, human experience tends, in a good many ways, to support the idea that when the nightmare grows black enough, horror spawns horror, one coincidental evil begets other, often more deliberate evils, until finally blackness seems to cover everything. And the most terrifying question of all may be just how much horror the human mind can stand and still maintain a wakeful, staring, unrelenting sanity. That such events have their own Rube Goldberg absurdity goes almost without saying. At some point, it all starts to become rather funny. That may be the point at which sanity begins either to save itself or to buckle and break down; that point at which one's sense of humor begins to reassert its"

The Antichrist can be born from piety itself, from excessive love of God or of the truth, as the heretic is born from the saint and the possessed from the seer. Fear prophets, Adso, and those prepared to die for the truth, for as a rule they make many others die with them, often before them, at times instead of them.

34,1981,midnights children,5,"One Kashmiri morning in the early spring of 1915, my grandfather Aadam Aziz hit his nose against a frost-hardened tussock of earth while attempting to pray. Three drops of blood plopped out of his left nostril, hardened instantly in the brittle air and lay before his eyes on the prayer-mat, transformed into rubies. Lurching back until he knelt with his head once more upright, he found that the tears which had sprung to his eyes had solidified, too; and at that moment, as he brushed diamonds contemptuously from his lashes, he resolved never again to kiss earth for any god or man. This decision, however, made a hole in him, a vacancy in a vital inner chamber, leaving him vulnerable to women and history. Unaware of this at first, despite his recently completed medical training, he stood up, rolled the prayer-mat into a thick cheroot, and holding it under his right arm surveyed the valley through clear, diamond-free eyes"

Touch others with them, pat them together, stroke them on your face 'cause they don't love that either. You got to love it, you! And no, they ain't in love with your mouth. Yonder, out there, they will see it broken and break it again. What you say out of it they will not heed. What you scream from it they do not hear.

I know this, because I was raised the Chinese way: I was taught to desire nothing, to swallow other people's misery, to eat my own bitterness. and even though I taught my daughter the opposite, she still came out the same way! Maybe it is because she was born to me and she was born a girl. And I was born to my mother and I was born a girl. All of us are like stairs, one step after another, going up and down, but all going the same way. I know how it is to be quiet, to listen and watch, as if your life were a dream.

And you may make revelations that cost you dearly only to have people look at you in a funny way, not understanding what you've said at all, or why you thought it was so important that you almost cried while you were saying it.

Fermina Daza was in the kitchen tasting the soup for supper when she heard Digna Pardo's horrified shriek and the shouting of the servants and then of the entire neighborhood. She dropped the tasting spoon and tried to run despite the invincible weight of her age, screaming like a madwoman without knowing yet what had happened under the mango leaves, and her heart jumped inside her ribs when she saw her man lying on his back in the mud, dead to this life but still resisting death's final blow for one last minute so that she would have time to come to him. He recognized her despite the uproar, through his tears of unrepeatable sorrow at dying without her, and he looked for her for the last and final time with eyes more luminous, more grief-stricken, more grateful that she had ever seen them in the half century of a shared life, and he managed to say to her with his last breath:"

After awhile it forgot the cerise color of the sun dying behind Kilimanjaro. After awhile it only knew the muddy, smogged-out sunsets of Boston, that was all it remembered and all it wanted to remember.

Perhaps even something deeper like the need to survive. Murray says we are fragile creatures surrounded by a world of hostile facts. Facts threaten our happiness and security. The deeper we delve into things, the looser our structure may seem to become. The family process works towards sealing off the world. Small errors grow heads, fictions proliferate. I tell Murray that ignorance and confusion can’t possibly be the driving forces behind family solidarity. What an idea, what a subversion. He asks me why the strongest family units exist in the least developed societies. Not to know is a weapon of survival, he says. Magic and superstition become entrenched as the powerful orthodoxy of the clan. The family is strongest where objective reality is most likely to be misinterpreted. What a heartless theory, I say.

One day early that June she shuffled out to the mailbox at the end of the driveway, leaning heavily on her Boston Post cane (which would go to Vin Marchant when the loudmouthed old bitch popped off, George Meara thought, and good riddance to you, Evvie) and smoking a Herbert Tareyton. She bellowed a greeting at Meara--her deafness had apparently convinced her that everyone else in the world had gone deaf in sympathy--and then shouted that they were going to have the hottest summer in thirty years.

One could presumably drive oneself to distraction in this way. In any case, while it is all very well to talk of 'turning points', one can surely only recognize such moments in retrospect. Naturally, when one looks back to such instances today, they may indeed take the appearance of being crucial, precious moments in one's life; but of course, at the time, this was not the impression one had. Rather, it was as though one had available a never-ending number of days, months, years in which to sort out the vagaries of one's relationship with Miss Kenton; an infinite number of further opportunities in which to remedy the effect of this or that misunderstanding. There was surely nothing to indicate at the time that such evidently small incidents would render whole dreams forever irredeemable"

Mostly it was hot chocolate she made, warming the milk in a saucepan on the stove before mixing it. Occasionally she made Bovril or Ovaltine. It was pleasant to take a hot drink up to her room and have it beside her as she sat in her silent room reading in the empty house in the afternoons.

The black youth suddenly made a ninety-degree turn and cut straight across the street to the sidewalk on the other side. The feeble yellow of a sodium-vapor streetlight reflected for an instant on his face as he checked Sherman out. He had crossed over! What a stroke of luck! Not once did it dawn on Sherman McCoy that what the boy had seen was a thirty-eight-year-old white man, soaking wet, dressed in some sort of military-looking raincoat full of straps and buckles, holding a violently lurching animal in his arms, staring, bug-eyed, and talking to himsel"

Respected, charming, hasn't produced a piece of work in ten years. He has a system, which he explained to me. First, he submits an outline for a biography to the Academy to be absolutely sure his approach is consistent with Party policy. A crucial first step, as you'll see later. Now, the person he studies is always an important figure - that is, someone from Moscow - hence Tomashevski must do his Russian research close to home for two years. But this historical character also traveled, yes, lived for some years in Paris or London; hence Tomashevski must do the same, apply for and receive permission for foreign residence. Four years have passed. The Academy and the Party are rubbing their hands in anticipation of this seminal study of the important figure by the eminent Tomashevski. And now Tomashevski must retire to the solitude of a dacha outside Moscow to tend his garden and creatively brood over his cartons of research. Two more years pass in seminal thought. And just as Tomashevski is about to commit himself to paper, he checks with the Academy again only to learn that Party policy has totally about-faced; his hero is a traitor, and with regrets all around, Tomashevski must sacrifice his years of labor for the greater good. Naturally, they are only too happy to urge Tomashevski to start a new pro"

On the other hand, the people whose business it is to ask why, the philosophers, have not been able to keep up with the advance of scientific theories. In the eighteenth century, philosophers considered the whole of human knowledge, including science, to be their field and discussed questions such as: Did the universe have a beginning? However, in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, science became too technical and mathematical for the philosophers, or anyone else except a few specialists. Philosophers reduced the scope of their inquiries so much that Wittgenstein, the most famous philosopher of this century, said, 'The sole remaining task for philosophy is the analysis of language.'

He escaped from bank vaults, nailed-up barrels, sewn mailbags; he escaped from a zinc-lined Knabe piano case, a giant football, a galvanized iron boiler, a rolltop desk, a sausage skin. His escapes were mystifying because he never damaged or appeared to unlock what he escaped from. The screen was pulled away and there he stood disheveled but triumphant beside the inviolate container that was supposed to have contained him. He waved to the crowd. He escaped from a sealed milk can filled with water. He escaped from a Siberian exile van. From a Chinese torture crucifix. From a Hamburg penitentiary. From an English prison ship. From a Boston jail. He was chained to automobile tires, water wheels, cannon, and he escaped. He dove manacled from a bridge into the Mississippi, the Seine, the Mersey, and came up waving. He hung upside down and strait-jacketed from cranes, biplanes and the tops of buildings.

The Serpent that announces, ""The World is a closed thing, cyclical, resonant, eternally-returning,"" is to be delivered into a system whose only aim is to violate the Cycle. Taking and not giving back, demanding that ""productivity"" and ""earnings"" keep on increasing with time, the System removing from the rest of the World these vast quantities of energy to keep its own tiny desperate fraction showing a profit: and not only most of humanity—most of the World, animal, vegetable, and mineral, is laid waste in the process. The System may or may not understand that it's only buying time. And that time is an artificial resource to begin with, of no value to anyone or anything but the System, which must sooner or later crash to its death, when its addiction to energy has become more than the rest of the World can supply, dragging with it innocent souls all along the chain of life.

This was the reason Americans shot each other so often: It was a convenient literary device for ending short stories and books.

Because that was the way authors customarily treated bit-part players in their made-up tales. And so on.Once I understood what was making America such a dangerous, unhappy nation of people who had nothing to do with real life, I resolved to shun storytelling. I would write about life.

Next, her father left in his own car; lastly a blond, good-looking man and a short fat one in an enormous overcoat like a pony blanket made their way to a sports car parked under the beech trees. For a moment she really thought there must be something wrong with the fat one, he followed so slowly and so painfully.

Frail and transitory as is every part of it, restless and migratory as are its elements, still it abides. It is bound together by a law of permanence, and though it is ever dying, it is ever coming to life again. Dissolution does but give birth to fresh modes of organization, and one death is the parent of a thousand lives. Each hour, as it comes, is but a testimony how fleeting, yet how secure, how certain, is the great whole. It is like an image on the waters, which is ever the same, though the waters ever flow. The sun sinks to rise again; the day is swallowed up in the gloom of night, to be born out of it, as fresh as if it had never been quenched. Spring passes into summer, and through summer and autumn into winter, only the more surely, by its own ultimate return, to triumph over that grave towards which it resolutely hastened from its first hour. We mourn the blossoms of May because they are to wither; but we know that May is one day to have its revenge upon November, by the revolution of that solemn circle which never stops—which teaches us in our height of hope, ever to be sober, and in our depth of desolation, never to desp"

I planned to examine his contribution in my master essay. In his view the primacy of the ethical over the esthetic mode was necessary to restore the balance. But enough of that. In myself I could observe the following sources of tedium: 1) The lack of a personal connection with the external world. Earlier I noted that when I was riding through France in a train last spring I looked out of the window and thought that the veil of Maya was wearing thin. And why was this? I wasn’t seeing what was there but only what everyone sees under a common directive. By this is implied that our worldview has used up nature. The rule of this view is that I, a subject, see the phenomena, the world of objects. They, however, are not necessarily in themselves objects as modern rationality defines objects. For in spirit, says Steiner, a man can step out of himself and let things speak to him about themselves, to speak about what has meaning not for him alone but also for them.

Pneumoencephalography was a technique developed in 1919 for taking images of the brain, which floats in a sea of liquid. That fluid protects the brain from damage, but makes it very difficult to X-ray, since images taken through fluid are cloudy. Pneumoencephalography involved drilling holes into the skulls of research subjects, draining the fluid surrounding their brains, and pumping air or helium into the skull in place of the fluid to allow crisp X-rays of the brain through the skull. the side effects--crippling headaches, dizziness, seizures, vomiting--lasted until the body naturally refilled the skull with spinal fluid, which usually took two to three months. Because pneumoencephalography could cause permanent brain damage and paralysis, it was abandoned in the 1970s.

When I met Nick, I knew immediately that was what he wanted, and for him, I guess I was willing to try. I will accept my portion of blame. The thing is, I was crazy about him at first. I found him perversely exotic, a good ole Missouri boy. He was so damn nice to be around. He teased things out in me that I didn’t know existed: a lightness, a humor, an ease. It was as if he hollowed me out and filled me with feathers. He helped me be Cool Girl – I couldn’t have been Cool Girl with anyone else. I wouldn’t have wanted to. I can’t say I didn’t enjoy some of it: I ate a MoonPie, I walked barefoot, I stopped worrying. I watched dumb movies and ate chemically laced foods. I didn’t think past the first step of anything, that was the key. I drank a Coke and didn’t worry about how to recycle the can or about the acid puddling in my belly, acid so powerful it could strip clean a penny. We went to a dumb movie and I didn’t worry about the offensive sexism or the lack of minorities in meaningful roles. I didn’t even worry whether the movie made sense. I didn’t worry about anything that came next. Nothing had consequence, I was living in the moment, and I could feel myself getting shallower and dumb"

When my first pen pal, Tomoko, stopped writing me after three letters she was the one who laughed: You think someone's going to lose life writing to you? Of course I cried; I was eight and I had already planned that Tomoko and her family would adopt me. My mother of course saw clean into the marrow of those dreams, and laughed. I wouldn't write to you either, she said. She was that kind of mother: who makes you doubt yourself, who would wipe you out if you let her. But I'm not going to pretend either.

(Because they had to be quiet on the hunt.) Why do women communicate so well? (Because they had to call out to one another where the fruits and berries were.) Why can men never find things around the house? (Because they have a narrow field of vision, useful in tracking prey.) Why can women find things so easily? (Because in protecting the nest they were used to scanning a wide field.) Why can't women parallel-park? (Because low testosterone inhibits spatial ability.) Why won't men ask for directions?

I know this is all mere apparition compared to what awaits us, but it is only lovelier for that. There is a human beauty in it. And I can’t believe that, when we have all been changed and put on incorruptibility, we will forget our fantastic condition of mortality and impermanence, the great bright dream of procreating and perishing that meant the whole world to us. In eternity this world will be Troy, I believe, and all that has passed here will be the epic of the universe, the ballad they sing in the streets.

Arthur, High King of Britain, was Constantine's grandson. He married up to three women, all called Guinevere, and his tomb is at Glastonbury, but you must understand that he is not really dead, only waiting his time to come again. His blessed descendant, Prince Arthur of England, was born in the year 1486, eldest son of Henry, the first Tudor king. This Arthur married Katharine the princess of Aragon, died at fifteen and was buried in Worcester Cathedral. If he were alive now, he would be King of England. His younger brother Henry would likely be Archbishop of Canterbury, and would not (at least, we devoutly hope not) be in pursuit of a woman of whom the cardinal hears nothing good: a woman to whom, several years before the dukes walk in to despoil him, he will need to turn his attention; whose history, before ruin seizes hi"

In the end all anyone could ever do was sum up the unknown factors in the ridiculous phrase, ""The fortunes of the battle swayed this way and that,"" or some similarly feeble and useless cliché. All of us, even when we think we have noted every tiny detail, resort to set pieces which have already been staged often enough by others. We try to reproduce the reality, but the harder we try, the more we find the pictures that make up the stock-in-trade of the spectacle of history forcing themselves upon us: the fallen drummer by, the infantry man shown in the act of stabbing another, the horse's eye starting from its socket, the invulnerable Emperor surrounded by his generals, a moment frozen still amidst the turmoil of battle.

And then he said that he was reading Capote's Breakfast at Tiffany's. Leaving aside the fact that A Simple Heart and A Christmas Carol were stories, not books, there was something revelatory about the taste of this bookish young pharmacist, who ... clearly and inarguably preferred minor works to major ones. He chose The Metamorphosis over The Trial, he chose Bartleby over Moby Dick, he chose A Simple Heart over Bouvard and Pecouchet, and A Christmas Carol over A Tale of Two Cities or The Pickwick Papers. What a sad paradox, thought Amalfitano. Now even bookish pharmacists are afraid to take on the great, imperfect, torrential works, books that blaze a path into the unknown. They choose the perfect exercises of the great masters. Or what amounts to the same thing: they want to watch the great masters spar, but they have no interest in real combat, when the great masters struggle against that something, that something that terrifies us all, that something that cows us and spurs us on, amid blood and mortal wounds and sten"

87,1969,slaughter house five,5,"ugh America is a nation of poor. Every other nation has folk traditions of men who were poor but extremely wise and virtuous, and therefore more estimable than anyone with power and gold. No such tales are told by the American poor. They mock themselves and glorify their betters. The meanest eating or drinking establishment, owned by a man who is himself poor, is very likely to have a sign on its wall asking this cruel question: 'if you’re so smart, why ain’t you rich?' There will also be an American flag no larger than a child’s hand – glued to a lollipop stick and flying from the cash register. Americans, like human beings everywhere, believe many things that are obviously untrue. Their most destructive untruth is that it is very easy for any American to make money. They will not acknowledge how in fact hard money is to come by, and, therefore, those who have no money blame and blame and blame themselves. This inward blame has been a treasure for the rich and powerful, who have had to do less for their poor, publicly and privately, than any other ruling class since, say Napoleonic times. Many novelties have come from America. The most startling of these, a thing without precedent, is a mas"

When a man showed up you didn’t want to look at his face and he didn’t want to look at yours, because it’s painful to see somebody so clear that it’s like looking inside him, but then neither did you want to look away and lose him completely.

You exist in a half-world suspended between two superstructures, one self-expression and the other self-destruction. You are strong, but there is a flaw in your strength, and unless you learn to control it the flaw will prove stronger than your strength and defeat you. The flaw? Explosive emotional reaction out of all proportion to the occasion. Why? Why this unreasonable anger at the sight of others who are happy or content, this growing contempt for people and the desire to hurt them? All right, you think they're fools, you despise them because their morals, their happiness is the source of your frustration and resentment. But these are dreadful enemies you carry within yourself--in time destructive as bullets. Mercifully, a bullet kills its victim. This other bacteria, permitted to age, does not kill a man but leaves in its wake the hulk of a creature torn and twisted; there is still fire within his being but it is kept alive by casting upon it faggots of scorn and hate.

Those secret tastes, defeated in the past by oranges and rhubarb, broke out into an irrepressible urge when she began to weep. She went back to eating earth. The first time she did it almost out of curiosity, sure that the bad taste would be the best cure for the temptation. And, in fact, she could not bear the earth in her mouth. But she persevered, overcome by the growing anxiety, and little by little she was getting back her ancestral appetite, the taste of primary minerals, the unbridled satisfaction of what was the original food. She would put handfuls of earth in her pockets, and ate them in small bits without being seen, with a confused feeling of pleasure and rage, as she instructed her girl friends in the most difficult needlepoint and spoke about other men, who did not deserve the sacrifice of having one eat the whitewash on the walls because of them. The handfuls of earth made the only man who deserved that show of degradation less remote and more certain, as if the ground that he walked on with his fine patent leather boo"

He tells us that a single obscure decision of prophecy, perhaps the choice of one word over another, could change the entire aspect of the future.

It was summertime, and two children scampered down the sidewalk toward a man approaching in the distance. The man waved, and the children raced each other to him. It was still summertime, and the children came closer. A boy trudged down the sidewalk dragging a fishingpole behind him. A man stood waiting with his hands on his hips. Summertime, and his children played in the front yeard with their friend, enacting a strange little drama of their own invention.

We believed in it, this downward motion: so lovely, like flying, and yet at the same time so dire, so extreme, so unlikely. God is love, they once said, but we reversed that, and love, like heaven, was always just around the corner. The more difficult it was to love the particular man beside us, the more we believed in Love, abstract and total. We were waiting, always, for the incarnation. That word, made flesh. And sometimes it happened, for a time. That kind of love comes and goes and is hard to remember afterwards, like pain. You would look at the man one day and you would think, I loved you, and the tense would be past, and you would be filled with a sense of wonder, because it was such an amazing and precarious and dumb thing to have done; and you would know too why your friends had been evasive about it, at the time."

For the grim years were removed from the face of Aragorn, and he seemed clothed in white, a young lord fall and fair; and he spoke words in the Elvish tongue to one whom Frodo could not see. Arwen vanimelda, namarie!

162,1972,watership down,5,"The full moon, well risen in a cloudless eastern sky, covered the high solitude with its light. We are not conscious of daylight as that which displaces darkness. Daylight, even when the sun is clear of clouds, seems to us simply the natural condition of the earth and air. When we think of the downs, we think of the downs in daylight, as with think of a rabbit with its fur on. Stubbs may have envisaged the skeleton inside the horse, but most of us do not: and we do not usually envisage the downs without daylight, even though the light is not a part of the down itself as the hide is part of the horse itself. We take daylight for granted. But moonlight is another matter. It is inconstant. The full moon wanes and returns again. Clouds may obscure it to an extent to which they cannot obscure daylight. Water is necessary to us, but a waterfall is not. Where it is to be found it is something extra, a beautiful ornament. We need daylight and to that extent it us utilitarian, but moonlight we do not need. When it comes, it serves no necessity. It transforms. It falls upon the banks and the grass, separating one long blade from another; turning a drift of brown, frosted leaves from a single heap to innumerable flashing fragments; or glimmering lengthways along wet twigs as though light itself were ductile.

Sometimes a book can be called from the dust and the dark to produce a book which can be bought in shops, and perhaps it is interesting, but the people who buy it and read it because it is interesting are not serious people, if they were serious they would not care about the interest they would be writing thousands of words to consign to the dust and the dark. There are people who think death a fate worse than boredom."

The first man that began to sweep is the Law; the damsel that brought water and sprinkled it is the gospel.

And in the morning, when I open my eyes, I behold the sun once more, and am wretched. If I were whimsical, I might blame the weather, or an acquaintance, or some personal disappointment, for my discontented mind; and then this insupportable load of trouble would not rest entirely upon myself. But, alas! I feel it too sadly; I am alone the cause of my own woe, am I not? Truly, my own bosom contains the source of all my pleasure. Am I not the same being who once enjoyed an excess of happiness, who at every step saw paradise open before him, and whose heart was ever expanded towards the whole world? And this heart is now dead; no sentiment can revive it. My eyes are dry; and my senses, no more refreshed by the influence of soft tears, wither and consume my brain. I suffer much, for I have lost the only charm of life: that active, sacred power which created worlds around me,—it is no more. When I look from my window at the distant hills, and behold the morning sun breaking through the mists, and illuminating the country around, which is still wrapped in silence, whilst the soft stream winds gently through the willows, which have shed their leaves; when glorious Nature displays all her beauties before me, and her wondrous prospects are ineffectual to extract one tear of joy from my withered heart,—I feel that in such a moment I stand like a reprobate before heaven, hardened, insensible, and unmoved.

The Interpreter answered, ""This parlor is the heart of a man that has never been sanctified by the sweet grace of the gospel; the dust is his original sin and inward corruptions that have defiled the whole man.

But, alas! I feel it too sadly; I am alone the cause of my own woe, am I not? Truly, my own bosom contains the source of all my pleasure. Am I not the same being who once enjoyed an excess of happiness, who at every step saw paradise open before him, and whose heart was ever expanded towards the whole world? And this heart is now dead; no sentiment can revive it. My eyes are dry; and my senses, no more refreshed by the influence of soft tears, wither and consume my brain. I suffer much, for I have lost the only charm of life: that active, sacred power which created worlds around me,—it is no more. When I look from my window at the distant hills, and behold the morning sun breaking through the mists, and illuminating the country around, which is still wrapped in silence, whilst the soft stream winds gently through the willows, which have shed their leaves; when glorious Nature displays all her beauties before me, and her wondrous prospects are ineffectual to extract one tear of joy from my withered heart,—I feel that in such a moment I stand like a reprobate before heaven, hardened, insensible, and unmoved.

I feel something like a', 'satisfaction in the midst of my concern, that I was fortunate enough to have him', 'under my roof before his departure."" It can hardly be doubted that the old', 'Quaker schoolmaster succeeded with his pupil who was already so favorably', 'inclined, and it is more than probable that the daily example of one who lived', 'out his precepts was strong in its influence upon a young and generous mind.', '', 'Burke attended school at Ballitore two years; then, at the age of fourteen, he', 'became a student at Trinity College, Dublin, and remained there five years. At', 'college he was unsystematic and careless of routine. He seems to have done', 'pretty much as he pleased, and, however methodical he became in after life, his', 'study during these five years was rambling and spasmodic. The only definite', 'knowledge we have of this period is given by Burke himself in letters to his', 'former friend Richard Shackleton, son of his old schoolmaster. What he did was', 'done with a zest that at times became a feverish impatience: ""First I was', 'greatly taken with natural philosophy, which, while I should have given my mind', 'to logic, employed me incessantly. This I call my FUROR MATHEMATICUS."" Following', 'in succession come his FUROR LOGICUS, FUROR HISTORICUS, and FUROR PEOTICUS, each', 'of which absorbed him for the time being. It would be wrong, however, to think', 'of Burke as a trifler even in his youth. He read in the library three hours', 'every day and we may be sure he read as intelligently as eagerly. It is more', 'than probable that like a few other great minds he did not need a rigid system', 'to guide him. If he chose his subjects of study at pleasure, there is every', 'reason to believe he mastered them.', '', 'Of intimate friends at the University we hear nothing.

Pope's enemies made as free with his person as with"", 'his poetry, and there is little doubt that he felt the former attacks', 'the more bitterly of the two. Dennis, his first critic, called him ""a', 'short squab gentleman, the very bow of the God of love; his outward form', 'is downright monkey."" A rival poet whom he had offended hung up a rod in', 'a coffee house where men of letters resorted, and threatened to whip', 'Pope like a naughty child if he showed his face there.

He affected, indeed, to despise his assailants,', 'but there is only too good evidence that their poisoned arrows rankled', 'in his heart.

He roamed through"", 'the classic poets, translating passages that pleased him, went up for a', 'time to London to get lessons in French and Italian, and above all read', 'with eagerness and attention the works of older English poets,--Spenser,', 'Waller, and Dryden.

After He had reviewed it a little while, the Interpreter called for a man to come and sweep. Now when he began to sweep, the dust began to fly about so much and was so thick that Christian almost choked. Then said the Interpreter to a damsel who stood nearby, ""Bring water, and sprinkle the room."" When she had done as requested, it was swept and cleansed very pleasantly. Then Christian asked, ""What does this mean?"" The Interpreter answered, ""This parlor is the heart of a man that has never been sanctified by the sweet grace of the gospel; the dust is his original sin and inward corruptions that have defiled the whole man. The first man that began to sweep is the Law; the damsel that brought water and sprinkled it is the gospel. You saw that as soon as the first man began to sweep, the dust filled the room so thickly that it could not be cleansed, and you almost choked on it.

After reading', 'these words, one cannot but regret that Defoe did not try to create', 'heroines more virtuous than Moll Flanders and Roxana.', '', 'It is not only in drawing his characters that Defoe, in _The Fortunate', 'Mistress_, comes nearer than usual to producing a novel.

In both of them--the story of a solitary on a desert', 'island and the story of the visitation of a pestilence--the nature of', ""the subject made the author's course tolerably plain; in _The Fortunate"", 'Mistress_, the proper course was by no means so well marked.

Parliament had been for a long time only partially', 'representative of the people; it now ceased to be so almost completely.', '', 'With, the support which such methods secured, along with encouragement from his', 'ministers, the king was prepared to put in operation his policy for regulating', 'the affairs of America. Writs of Assistance (1761) were followed by the passage', 'of the Stamp Act (1765). The ostensible object of both these measures was to', 'help pay the debt incurred by the French war, but the real purpose lay deeper,', 'and was nothing more or less than the ultimate extension of parliamentary rule,', 'in great things as well as small, to America. At this crisis, so momentous for', 'the colonists, the Rockingham ministry was formed, and Burke, together with', 'Pitt, supported a motion for the unconditional repeal of the Stamp Act. After', 'much wrangling, the motion was carried, and the first blunder of the mother', 'country seemed to have been smoothed over.', '', 'Only a few months elapsed, however, when the question of taxing the colonies was', 'revived. Pitt lay ill, and could take no part in the proposed measure. Through', 'the influence of other members of his party,--notably Townshend,--a series of', 'acts were passed, imposing duties on several exports to America. This was', 'followed by a suspension of the New York Assembly, because it had disregarded', 'instructions in the matter of supplies for the troops. The colonists were', 'furious. Matters went from bad to worse. To withdraw as far as possible without', 'yielding the principle at stake, the duties on all the exports mentioned in the', 'bill were removed, except that on tea. But it was precisely the principle for', 'which the colonists were contending. They were not in the humor for compromise,', 'when they believed their freedom was endangered, and the strength and', 'determination of their resistance found a climax in the Boston Tea Party.', '', 'In the meantime, Lord North, who was absolutely obedient to the king, had become', 'prime minister. Five bills were prepared, the tenor of which, it was thought,', 'would overawe the colonists. Of these, the Boston Port Bill and the Regulating', 'Act are perhaps the most famous, though the ultimate tendency of all was blindly', 'coercive.', '', 'While the king and his friends were busy with these, the opposition proposed an', 'unconditional repeal of the Tea Act.

To avert this, some of England's greatest statesmen--Pitt"", 'among the number--asked for a reconsideration.

He was born in Dublin, Ireland,"", 'in 1729. His father was a successful lawyer and a Protestant, his mother, a', 'Catholic. At the age of twelve, he became a pupil of Abraham Shackleton, a', 'Quaker, who had been teaching some fifteen years at Ballitore, a small town', 'thirty miles from Dublin. In after years Burke was always pleased to speak of', 'his old friend in the kindest way: ""If I am anything,"" he declares, ""it is the', 'education I had there that has made me so."" And again at Shackleton\'s death,', 'when Burke was near the zenith of his fame and popularity, he writes: ""I had a', 'true honor and affection for that excellent man. I feel something like a', 'satisfaction in the midst of my concern, that I was fortunate enough to have him', 'under my roof before his departure."" It can hardly be doubted that the old', 'Quaker schoolmaster succeeded with his pupil who was already so favorably', 'inclined, and it is more than probable that the daily example of one who lived', 'out his precepts was strong in its influence upon a young and generous mind.', '', 'Burke attended school at Ballitore two years; then, at the age of fourteen, he', 'became a student at Trinity College, Dublin, and remained there five years. At', 'college he was unsystematic and careless of routine. He seems to have done', 'pretty much as he pleased, and, however methodical he became in after life, his', 'study during these five years was rambling and spasmodic. The only definite', 'knowledge we have of this period is given by Burke himself in letters to his', 'former friend Richard Shackleton, son of his old schoolmaster. What he did was', 'done with a zest that at times became a feverish impatience: ""First I was', 'greatly taken with natural philosophy, which, while I should have given my mind', 'to logic, employed me incessantly. This I call my FUROR MATHEMATICUS."" Following', 'in succession come his FUROR LOGICUS, FUROR HISTORICUS, and FUROR PEOTICUS, each', 'of which absorbed him for the time being. It would be wrong, however, to think', 'of Burke as a trifler even in his youth. He read in the library three hours', 'every day and we may be sure he read as intelligently as eagerly. It is more', 'than probable that like a few other great minds he did not need a rigid system', 'to guide him. If he chose his subjects of study at pleasure, there is every', 'reason to believe he mastered them.', '', 'Of intimate friends at the University we hear nothing. Goldsmith came one year', 'later, but there is no evidence that they knew each other. It is probable that', 'Burke, always reserved, had little in common with his young associates. His own', 'musings, with occasional attempts at writing poetry, long walks through the', 'country, and frequent letters to and from Richard Shackleton, employed him when', 'not at his books.', '', 'Two years after taking his degree, Burke went to London and established himself', 'at the Middle Temple for the u']"

Although Harley's Ministry did give the"", 'Order of the Garter to Argyll on 20 December 1710, he was never', 'promoted over Marlborough, but that was not due to any lack of success', ""in assuring a Tory victory in the election of the peers.

All', ""three were staunch supporters of England's commercial interests, the"", 'Hanoverian Succession, liberty of conscience for Dissenters and', 'Nonconformists, and the terms of the Revolution Settlement. It must be', 'remembered that Godolphin and Harley were both moderates, each trying', 'to chart his course between the extremes of the parties. They, like', 'Daniel Defoe, saw their loyalty being to England and to the Queen, not', 'to a party. Like Defoe, they both discovered that politics often make', 'strange bedfellows. Godolphin, faced with a large Whig majority in the', 'House of Commons after the General Election of 1708, found that his', 'fortunes were bound to those of the Junto.

At this crisis, so momentous for', 'the colonists, the Rockingham ministry was formed, and Burke, together with', 'Pitt, supported a motion for the unconditional repeal of the Stamp Act. After', 'much wrangling, the motion was carried, and the first blunder of the mother', 'country seemed to have been smoothed over.', '', 'Only a few months elapsed, however, when the question of taxing the colonies was', 'revived. Pitt lay ill, and could take no part in the proposed measure. Through', 'the influence of other members of his party,--notably Townshend,--a series of', 'acts were passed, imposing duties on several exports to America. This was', 'followed by a suspension of the New York Assembly, because it had disregarded', 'instructions in the matter of supplies for the troops. The colonists were', 'furious. Matters went from bad to worse. To withdraw as far as possible without', 'yielding the principle at stake, the duties on all the exports mentioned in the', 'bill were removed, except that on tea. But it was precisely the principle for', 'which the colonists were contending. They were not in the humor for compromise,', 'when they believed their freedom was endangered, and the strength and', 'determination of their resistance found a climax in the Boston Tea Party.', '', 'In the meantime, Lord North, who was absolutely obedient to the king, had become', 'prime minister. Five bills were prepared, the tenor of which, it was thought,', 'would overawe the colonists. Of these, the Boston Port Bill and the Regulating', 'Act are perhaps the most famous, though the ultimate tendency of all was blindly', 'coercive.', '', 'While the king and his friends were busy with these, the opposition proposed an', 'unconditional repeal of the Tea Act. The bill was introduced only to be', 'overwhelmingly defeated by the same Parliament that passed the five measures of', 'Lord North.', '', 'In America, the effect of these proceedings was such as might have been expected', 'by thinking men. The colonies were as a unit in their support of Massachusetts.', ""The Regulating Act was set at defiance, public officers in the king's service"", 'were forced to resign, town meetings were held, and preparations for war were', ""begun in dead earnest. To avert this, some of England's greatest statesmen--Pitt"", 'among the number--asked for a reconsideration. On February the first, 1775, a', 'bill was introduced, which would have gone far toward bringing peace. One month', 'later, Burke delivered his speech on Conciliation with the Colonies.', '', '', '', '', 'EDMUND BURKE', '', ""There is nothing unusual in Burke's early life. He was born in Dublin, Ireland,"", 'in 1729. His father was a successful lawyer and a Protestant, his mother, a', 'Catholic. At the age of twelve, he became a pupil of Abraham Shackleton, a', 'Quaker, who had been teaching some fifteen years at Ballitore, a small town', 'thirty miles from Dublin. In after years Burke was always pleased to speak of', 'his old friend in the kindest way: ""If I am anything,"" he declares, ""it is the', 'education I had there that has made me so."" And again at Shackleton\'s death,', 'when Burke was near the zenith of his fame and popularity, he writes: ""I had a', 'true honor and affection for that excellent man. I feel something like a', 'satisfaction in the midst of my concern, that I was fortunate enough to have him', 'under my roof before his departure."" It can hardly be doubted that the old', 'Quaker schoolmaster succeeded with his pupil who was already so favorably', 'inclined, and it is more than probable that the daily example of one who lived', 'out his precepts was strong in its influence upon a young and generous mind.', '', 'Burke attended school at Ballitore two years; then, at the age of fourteen, he', 'became a student at Trinity College, Dublin, and remained there five years. At', 'college he was unsystematic and careless of routine. He seems to have done', 'pretty much as he pleased, and, however methodical he became in after life, his', 'study during these five years was rambling and spasmodic. The only definite', 'knowledge we have of this period is given by Burke himself in letters to his', 'former friend Richard Shackleton, son of his old schoolmaster. What he did was', 'done with a zest that at times became a feverish impatience: ""First I was', 'greatly taken with natural philosophy, which, while I should have given my mind', 'to logic, employed me incessantly. This I call my FUROR MATHEMATICUS."" Following', 'in succession come his FUROR LOGICUS, FUROR HISTORICUS, and FUROR PEOTICUS, each', 'of which absorbed him for the time being. It would be wrong, however, to think', 'of Burke as a trifler even in his youth. He read in the library three hours', 'every day and we may be sure he read as intelligently as eagerly. It is more', 'than probable that like a few other great minds he did not need a rigid system', 'to guide him. If he chose his subjects of study at pleasure, there is every', 'reason to believe he mastered them.', '', 'Of intimate friends at the University we hear nothing. Goldsmith came one year', 'later, but there is no evidence that they knew each other. It is probable that', 'Burke, always reserved, had little in common with his young associates. His own', 'musings, with occasional attempts at writing poetry, long walks through the', 'country, and frequent letters to and from Richard Shackleton, employed him when', 'not at his books.', '', 'Two years after taking his degree, Burke went to London and established himself', 'at the Middle Temple for the u']"

Silent, lonely, and sublime, it seemed to stand the sovereign of the scene, and to frown defiance on all, who dared to invade its solitary reign.

Disgusted at the guilt or absurdity of Mankind, the Misanthrope flies from it: He resolves to become an Hermit, and buries himself in the Cavern of some gloomy Rock. While Hate inflames his bosom, possibly He may feel contented with his situation: But when his passions begin to cool; when Time has mellowed his sorrows, and healed those wounds which He bore with him to his solitude, think you that Content becomes his Companion? Ah! no, Rosario. No longer sustained by the violence of his passions, He feels all the monotony of his way of living, and his heart becomes the prey of Ennui and weariness. He looks round, and finds himself alone in the Universe: The love of society revives in his bosom, and He pants to return to that world which He has abandoned. Nature loses all her charms in his eyes: No one is near him to point out her beauties, or share in his admiration of her excellence and variety. Propped upon the fragment of some Rock, He gazes upon the tumbling waterfall with a vacant eye, He views without emotion the glory of the setting Sun. Slowly He returns to his Cell at Evening, for no one there is anxious for his arrival; He has no comfort in his solitary unsavoury meal: He throws himself upon his couch of Moss despondent and dissatisfied, and wakes only to pass a day as joyless, as monotonous as the form"

She was the very warm', 'stuff of life to him.', '', 'Wonderful then, those days at Crockham Cottage, the first days, all alone', 'save for the woman who came to work in the mornings. Marvellous days,', 'when she had all his tall, supple, fine-fleshed youth to herself, for', 'herself, and he had her like a ruddy fire into which he could cast', 'himself for rejuvenation.

Dark, like a lair where strong beasts had lurked and', 'mated, lonely at night and lonely by day, left to themselves and their', 'own intensity for so many generations. It seemed to cast a spell on the', 'two young people. They became different. There was a curious secret glow', 'about them, a certain slumbering flame hard to understand, that enveloped', 'them both.

One day Winifred heard the strangest scream from the flower-bed', 'under the low window of the living room: ah, the strangest scream, like', 'the very soul of the dark past crying aloud. She ran out, and saw a long', 'brown snake on the flower-bed, and in its flat mouth the one hind leg of', 'a frog was striving to escape, and screaming its strange, tiny, bellowing', 'scream.

The spear of modern invention had not passed through', 'it, and it lay there secret, primitive, savage as when the Saxons first', 'came. And Egbert and she were caught there, caught out of the world.', '', 'He was not idle, nor was she. There were plenty of things to be done, the', 'house to be put into final repair after the workmen had gone, cushions', 'and curtains to sew, the paths to make, the water to fetch and attend to,', 'and then the slope of the deep-soiled, neglected garden to level, to', 'terrace with little terraces and paths, and to fill with flowers. He', 'worked away, in his shirt-sleeves, worked all day intermittently doing', 'this thing and the other. And she, quiet and rich in herself, seeing him', 'stooping and labouring away by himself, would come to help him, to be', 'near him. He of course was an amateur--a born amateur. He worked so hard,', 'and did so little, and nothing he ever did would hold together for long.', 'If he terraced the garden, he held up the earth with a couple of long', 'narrow planks that soon began to bend with the pressure from behind, and', 'would not need many years to rot through and break and let the soil', 'slither all down again in a heap towards the stream-bed. But there you', 'are. He had not been brought up to come to grips with anything, and he', 'thought it would do. Nay, he did not think there was anything else except', 'little temporary contrivances possible, he who had such a passion for his', 'old enduring cottage, and for the old enduring things of the bygone', 'England.

The', 'young man who should ""chuck"" admired politics, and of course some other', ""admired object with them, would be all very well; but he wouldn't be"", 'enough--therefore what should one say to some other young man who would', 'chuck something and somebody else, admired in their way too?', '', 'There need never, at the worst, be any difficulty about the things', 'advantageously chuckable for art; the question is all but of choosing', 'them in the heap. Yet were I to represent a struggle--an interesting', 'one, indispensably--with the passions of the theatre (as a profession,', 'or at least as an absorption) I should have to place the theatre in', 'another light than the satiric. This, however, would by good luck be', 'perfectly possible too--without a sacrifice of truth; and I should', 'doubtless even be able to make my theatric case as important as I might', 'desire it. It seemed clear that I needed big cases--small ones would', 'practically give my central idea away; and I make out now my still', 'labouring under the illusion that the case of the sacrifice for art', '_can_ ever be, with truth, with taste, with discretion involved,', 'apparently and showily ""big."" I daresay it glimmered upon me even then', 'that the very sharpest difficulty of the victim of the conflict I should', 'seek to represent, and the very highest interest of his predicament,', 'dwell deep in the fact that his repudiation of the great obvious, great', 'moral or functional or useful character, shall just have to consent to', 'resemble a surrender for absolutely nothing. Those characters are all', 'large and expansive, seated and established and endowed; whereas the', 'most charming truth about the preference for art is that to parade', 'abroad so thoroughly inward and so naturally embarrassed a matter is to', 'falsify and vulgarise it; that as a preference attended with the honours', 'of publicity it is indeed nowhere; that in fact, under the rule of its', 'sincerity, its only honours are those of contradiction, concentration', 'and a seemingly deplorable indifference to everything but itself.', 'Nothing can well figure as less ""big,"" in an honest thesis, than a', ""marked instance of somebody's willingness to pass mainly for an ass. Of"", 'these things I must, I say, have been in strictness aware; what I', 'perhaps failed of was to note that if a certain romantic glamour (even', 'that of mere eccentricity or of a fine perversity) may be flung over the', 'act of exchange of a ""career"" for the esthetic life in general, the', 'prose and the modesty of the matter yet come in with any exhibition of', 'the particular branch of esthetics selected. Then it is that the', 'attitude of hero or heroine may look too much--for the romantic', 'effect--like a low crouching over proved trifles. Art indeed has in our', 'day taken on so many honours and emoluments that the recognition of its', 'importance is more than a custom, has become on occasion almost a fury:', 'the line is drawn--especially in the English world--only at the', 'importance of heeding what it may mean.', '', 'The more I turn my pieces over, at any rate, the more I now see I must', 'have found in them, and I remember how, once well in presence of my', 'three typical examples, my fear of too ample a canvas quite dropped. The', 'only question was that if I had marked my political case, from so far', 'back, for ""a story by itself,"" and then marked my theatrical case for', 'another, the joining together of these interests, originally seen as', 'separate, might, all disgracefully, betray the seam, show for mechanical', 'and superficial. A story was a story, a picture a picture, and I had a', 'mortal horror of two stories, two pictures, in one. The reason of this', 'was the clearest--my subject was immediately, under that disadvantage,', 'so cheated of its indispensable centre as to become of no more use for', 'expressing a main intention than a wheel without a hub is of use for', 'moving a cart. It was a fact, apparently, that one _had_ on occasion', 'seen two pictures in one; were there not for instance certain sublime', 'Tintorettos at Venice, a measureless Crucifixion in especial, which', 'showed without loss of authority half-a-dozen actions separately taking', 'place? Yes, that might be, but there had surely been nevertheless a', 'mighty pictorial fusion, so that the virtue of composition had somehow', 'thereby come all mysteriously to its own. Of course the affair would be', 'simple enough if composition could be kept out of the question; yet by', 'what art or process, what bars and bolts, what unmuzzled dogs and', 'pointed guns, perform that feat? I had to know myself utterly inapt for', 'any such valour and recognise that, to make it possible, sundry things', 'should have begun for me much further back than I had felt them even in', 'their dawn. A picture without composition slights its most precious', 'chance for beauty, and is, moreover, not composed at all unless the', 'painter knows _how_ that principle of health and safety, working as an', 'absolutely premeditated art, has prevailed.

That was one of the swell things you could count on. I thought I had paid for everything. Not like the woman pays and pays and pays. No idea of retribution or punishment. Just exchange of values. You gave up something and got something else. Or you worked for something. You paid some way for everything that was any good. I paid my way into enough things that I liked, so that I had a good time. Either you paid by learning about them, or by experience, or by taking chances, or by money.

157,1926,the sun also rises,4,"Women made such swell friends. Awfully swell. In the first place, you had to be in love with a woman to have a basis of friendship. I had been having Brett for a friend. I had not been thinking about her side of it. I had been getting something for nothing. That only delayed the presentation of the bill. The bill always came. That was one of the swell things you could count on. I thought I had paid for everything. Not like the woman pays and pays and pays. No idea of retribution or punishment. Just exchange of values. You gave up something and got something else. Or you worked for something. You paid some way for everything that was any good. I paid my way into enough things that I liked, so that I had a good time. Either you paid by learning about them, or by experience, or by taking chances, or by money. Enjoying living was learning to get your money’s worth. The world was a good place to buy in. It seemed like a fine philosophy. In five years, I though, it will seem just as silly as all the other fine philosophies I’ve had"

That was one of the swell things you could count on. I thought I had paid for everything. Not like the woman pays and pays and pays. No idea of retribution or punishment. Just exchange of values. You gave up something and got something else. Or you worked for something. You paid some way for everything that was any good. I paid my way into enough things that I liked, so that I had a good time. Either you paid by learning about them, or by experience, or by taking chances, or by money.

157,1926,the sun also rises,4,"Women made such swell friends. Awfully swell. In the first place, you had to be in love with a woman to have a basis of friendship. I had been having Brett for a friend. I had not been thinking about her side of it. I had been getting something for nothing. That only delayed the presentation of the bill. The bill always came. That was one of the swell things you could count on. I thought I had paid for everything. Not like the woman pays and pays and pays. No idea of retribution or punishment. Just exchange of values. You gave up something and got something else. Or you worked for something. You paid some way for everything that was any good. I paid my way into enough things that I liked, so that I had a good time. Either you paid by learning about them, or by experience, or by taking chances, or by money. Enjoying living was learning to get your money’s worth. The world was a good place to buy in. It seemed like a fine philosophy. In five years, I though, it will seem just as silly as all the other fine philosophies I’ve had"

That power of doing everything', 'with perfect and _conscious_ ease, which Dugald Stewart has ascribed to', 'Barrow and to Horsley in prose, distinguished Dryden in poetry. Whether', 'he discusses the deep questions of fate and foreknowledge in ""Religio', 'Laici,"" or lashes Shaftesbury in the ""Medal,"" or pours a torrent of', 'contempt on Shadwell in ""MacFlecknoe,"" or describes the fire of London', 'in the ""Annus Mirabilis,"" or soars into lyric enthusiasm in his ""Ode on', 'the Death of Mrs Killigrew,"" and ""Alexander\'s Feast,"" or paints a', 'tournament in ""Palamon and Arcite,"" or a fairy dance in the ""Flower and', 'the Leaf,""--he is always at home, and always aware that he is. His', 'consciousness of his own powers amounts to exultation. He is like the', 'steed who glories in that tremendous gallop which affects the spectator', ""with fear. Indeed, we never can separate our conception of Dryden's"", 'vigorous and vaulting style from the image of a noble horse, devouring', 'the dust of the field, clearing obstacles at a bound, taking up long', 'leagues as a little thing, and the very strength and speed of whose', 'motion give it at a distance the appearance of smoothness. Pope speaks', 'of his', '', '""Long resounding march, and energy divine.""', '', 'Perhaps ""_ease_ divine"" had been words more characteristic of that', 'almost superhuman power of language by which he makes the most obstinate', 'materials pliant, melts down difficulties as if by the touch of magic,', 'and, to resume the former figure, comes into the goal without a hair', 'turned on his mane, or a single sweat-drop confessing effort or', 'extraordinary exertion. We know no poet since Homer who can be compared', 'to Dryden in this respect, except Scott, who occasionally, in ""Marmion,""', 'and the ""Lay of the Last Minstrel,"" exhibits the same impetuous ease and', 'fiery fluent movement. Scott does not, however, in general, carry the', 'same weight as the other; and the species of verse he uses, in', 'comparison to the heroic rhyme of Dryden, gives you often the impression', 'of a hard trot, rather than of a ""long-resounding"" and magnificent', 'gallop. Scott exhibits in his poetry the soul of a warrior; but it is of', 'a warrior of the Border--somewhat savage and coarse. Dryden can, for the', 'nonce at least, assume the appearance, and display the spirit, of a', 'knight of ancient chivalry--gallant, accomplished, elegant, and gay.', '', ""Next to this poet's astonishing ease, spirit, and elastic vigour, may be"", 'ranked his clear, sharp intellect. He may be called more a logician than', 'a poet. He reasons often, and always acutely, and his rhyme, instead of', 'shackling, strengthens the movement of his argumentation. Parts of his', '""Religio Laici"" and the ""Hind and Panther"" resemble portions of Duns', 'Scotus or Aquinas set on fire. Indeed, keen, strong intellect, inflamed', 'with passion, and inspirited by that ""ardour and impetuosity of mind""', 'which Wordsworth is compelled to allow to him, rather than creative or', 'original genius, is the differentia of Dryden. We have compared him to a', 'courser, but he was not one of those coursers of Achilles, who fed on no', 'earthly food, but on the golden barley of heaven, having sprung from the', 'gods--', '', '  [Greek: Xanthon kai Balion, to ama pnoiaesi, petesthaen.', '  Tous eteke Zephuro anemo Arpua Podargae.]', '', 'Dryden resembled rather the mortal steed which was yoked with these', 'immortal twain, the brood of Zephyr and the Harpy Podarga; only we can', 'hardly say of the poet what Homer says of Pedasus--', '', '[Greek: Os kai thnaetos eon, epeth ippois athanatoisi.]', '', 'He was _not_, although a mortal, able to keep up with the immortal', 'coursers. His path was on the plains or table-lands of earth--never or', 'seldom in ""cloudland, gorgeous land,"" or through the aerial altitudes', 'which stretch away and above the clouds to the gates of heaven. He can', 'hardly be said to have possessed the power of sublimity, in the high', 'sense of that term, as the power of sympathising with the feeling of the', 'Infinite. Often he gives us the impression of the picturesque, of the', 'beautiful, of the heroic, of the nobly disdainful--but never (when', 'writing, at least, entirely from his own mind) of that infinite and', 'nameless grandeur which the imaginative soul feels shed on it from the', 'multitudinous waves of ocean--from the cataract leaping from his rock,', 'as if to consummate an act of prayer to God--from the hum of great', 'assemblies of men--from the sight of far-extended wastes and', 'wildernesses--and from the awful silence, and the still more mysterious', 'sparkle of the midnight stars. This sense of the presence of the', '_shadow_ of immensity--immensity itself cannot be felt any more than', 'measured--this sight like that vouchsafed to Moses of the ""backparts"" of', 'the Divine--the Divine itself cannot be seen--has been the inspiration', 'of all the highest poetry of the world--of the ""Paradise Lost,"" of the', '""Divina Commedia,"" of the ""Night Thoughts,"" of Wordsworth and Coleridge,', 'of ""Festus,"" and, highest far, of the Hebrew Prophets, as they cry,', '""Whither can we go from Thy presence? whither can we flee from Thy', 'Spirit?"" Such poets have resembled a blind man, who feels, although he', 'cannot see, that a stranger of commanding air is in the room beside him;', 'so they stand awe-struck in the ""wind of the going"" of a majestic and', 'unseen Being. This feeling differs from mysticism, inasmuch as it is', 'connected with a reality, while the mystic dreams a vague and', 'unsupported dream, and the poetry it produces is simply the irresistible', 'cry springing from the perception of this wondrous Some One who is', 'actually near them. The feeling is connected, in general, with a lofty', 'moral and religious nature; and yet not always, since, while wanting in', 'Dryden, we find it intensely discovered, although in an imperfect and', 'perverted shape, in By']"

In ""Absalom and Achitophel"" he sneers at', 'Richard as Ishbosheth, but says nothing against the deceased giant Saul.', 'It is clear, too, that at first his desertion of the Cromwell party was', 'a loss to the poet. He lost the chance of their favour, in case a', 'reaction should come, his situation as secretary, and the shelter of', ""Pickering's princely mansion. As might have been expected, his ancient"", 'friends were indignant at the change, and not less so at the alteration', 'he thought proper at the same time to make in the spelling of his', 'name--from Driden to Dryden.', '', 'He went to reside in the obscure house of one Herringman, a bookseller,', 'in the New Exchange, and became for life a professional author. His', 'enemies afterwards reproached him bitterly for his mean circumstances at', 'this period of his life, and asserted that he was a mere drudge to', 'Herringman. He, at all events, did little in his own proper poetic', 'calling for two years. A poem on the Coronation of Charles, well fitted', 'to wipe away the stain of Cromwellism, and to attract upon the poet the', 'eye of that Rising-Sun, whose glory he sang with more zeal than truth; a', 'panegyric on the Lord Chancellor; and a satire on the Dutch; were all,', 'and are all short, and all savour of a vein somewhat hide-bound. He', 'planned, indeed, too, and partly wrote, one or more plays, and was', 'considered of consequence enough to be elected a member of the Royal', 'Society in 1662. Previous to this he had been introduced, through', 'Herringman, to Sir Robert Howard, son of the first Earl of Berkshire,', 'and a relation of Edward Howard, the author of ""British Princes,"" and', 'the object of the witty wrath of Butler. Sir Robert, too, had a', 'poetical propensity, and Dryden and he became and continued intimate for', 'a number of years, the poet assisting the knight in his literary', 'compositions, particularly in a play entitled ""The Indian Queen;"" and', 'the latter inviting the former to the family seat at Charlton, where', 'Dryden met in an unlucky hour his future wife, Lady Elizabeth Howard,', 'the sister of Sir Robert. It was on the 1st of December 1663, in St', ""Swithin's, London, and with the consent of the Earl, who settled about"", 'Â£60 a-year on his daughter, that this unhappy union took place. The lady', 'seems to have had absolutely none of the qualities which tend either to', ""command a husband's respect or to conciliate his regard, but is"", 'described as a woman of violent temper and weak understanding. Much of', ""the bitterness of Dryden's satire, some of the coarse licentiousness of"", 'his plays, and all the sarcasms at matrimony which he has scattered in', 'multitudes, throughout his works, may be traced to his domestic', 'unhappiness.', '', 'Otherwise, the match had some advantages. It broke up, for a time at', 'least, some licentious connexions he had formed, particularly, after a', 'time, one with Mrs Reeves the actress, with whom, having laid aside his', 'Norwich drugget, he used to eat tarts at the Mulberry Gardens, ""with a', 'sword and a Chadreux wig."" It secured to him, including his own', 'property, an income of about Â£100 a-year--a sum equal to Â£300 now--and', 'which, on the death of his mother, three years later, was increased by', 'Â£20 more, or Â£60 at the present value of money. He was thus protected', 'for life against the meaner and more miserable necessities of the', 'literary man, under which many of his unfortunate rivals were crushed;', 'and if he could not always command luxuries, he was always sure of', 'bread.', '', 'To improve his circumstances, however, and to enable him to keep up a', ""style of living in unison with his lady's rank, he must write, and the"", 'question arose, what mode of composition was likely to be the most', 'lucrative? Were he to continue to indite panegyrical verses, like those', 'to Clarendon, he stood a chance of having a few guineas tossed to him', 'now and then by a patron, like a crust to an unfortunate cur. Were he', 'to translate, or write prefaces for the booksellers, he might pay his', 'bill for salt, if diligent enough. For Satires as yet there was little', 'demand. The follies of the more fanatical of the Puritans were too', 'recent, although they were beginning to ripen for the hand of Butler;', 'and the far grosser absurdities of the Cavaliers were yet in blossom.', 'There remained nothing for an aspiring author but the stage, which', 'during the previous _regime_ had been abolished. While the French', 'Revolution was in progress, ay, even in the depths of the reign of', 'terror, the theatres were all open, and all crowded; but when Cromwell', 'was enacting his solemn and solitary part, before God, angels, and men,', 'the petty potentates--the gods and goddesses of the stage--vanished into', 'thin air. At his tremendous stamp their cue had been ""_Exeunt omnes_""', 'and if the spirit of Shakspeare himself had witnessed the departure, he', 'would have added his Amen. And had he watched in their stead the', 'gigantic actor treading his trembling stage alone, with all the world', 'looking on, he might have remembered and re-applied his own magnificent', 'words--', '', '  ""O for a muse of fire, that would ascend', '  The brightest heaven of invention!', '  A kingdom for a stage, princes to act,', '  And _monarchs_ to _behold_ the swelling scene!', '  Then should the warlike _Cromwell_ like himself', '  Assume the port of Mars; and at his ']"

That power of doing everything', 'with perfect and _conscious_ ease, which Dugald Stewart has ascribed to', 'Barrow and to Horsley in prose, distinguished Dryden in poetry. Whether', 'he discusses the deep questions of fate and foreknowledge in ""Religio', 'Laici,"" or lashes Shaftesbury in the ""Medal,"" or pours a torrent of', 'contempt on Shadwell in ""MacFlecknoe,"" or describes the fire of London', 'in the ""Annus Mirabilis,"" or soars into lyric enthusiasm in his ""Ode on', 'the Death of Mrs Killigrew,"" and ""Alexander\'s Feast,"" or paints a', 'tournament in ""Palamon and Arcite,"" or a fairy dance in the ""Flower and', 'the Leaf,""--he is always at home, and always aware that he is. His', 'consciousness of his own powers amounts to exultation. He is like the', 'steed who glories in that tremendous gallop which affects the spectator', ""with fear. Indeed, we never can separate our conception of Dryden's"", 'vigorous and vaulting style from the image of a noble horse, devouring', 'the dust of the field, clearing obstacles at a bound, taking up long', 'leagues as a little thing, and the very strength and speed of whose', 'motion give it at a distance the appearance of smoothness. Pope speaks', 'of his', '', '""Long resounding march, and energy divine.""', '', 'Perhaps ""_ease_ divine"" had been words more characteristic of that', 'almost superhuman power of language by which he makes the most obstinate', 'materials pliant, melts down difficulties as if by the touch of magic,', 'and, to resume the former figure, comes into the goal without a hair', 'turned on his mane, or a single sweat-drop confessing effort or', 'extraordinary exertion. We know no poet since Homer who can be compared', 'to Dryden in this respect, except Scott, who occasionally, in ""Marmion,""', 'and the ""Lay of the Last Minstrel,"" exhibits the same impetuous ease and', 'fiery fluent movement. Scott does not, however, in general, carry the', 'same weight as the other; and the species of verse he uses, in', 'comparison to the heroic rhyme of Dryden, gives you often the impression', 'of a hard trot, rather than of a ""long-resounding"" and magnificent', 'gallop. Scott exhibits in his poetry the soul of a warrior; but it is of', 'a warrior of the Border--somewhat savage and coarse. Dryden can, for the', 'nonce at least, assume the appearance, and display the spirit, of a', 'knight of ancient chivalry--gallant, accomplished, elegant, and gay.', '', ""Next to this poet's astonishing ease, spirit, and elastic vigour, may be"", 'ranked his clear, sharp intellect. He may be called more a logician than', 'a poet. He reasons often, and always acutely, and his rhyme, instead of', 'shackling, strengthens the movement of his argumentation. Parts of his', '""Religio Laici"" and the ""Hind and Panther"" resemble portions of Duns', 'Scotus or Aquinas set on fire. Indeed, keen, strong intellect, inflamed', 'with passion, and inspirited by that ""ardour and impetuosity of mind""', 'which Wordsworth is compelled to allow to him, rather than creative or', 'original genius, is the differentia of Dryden. We have compared him to a', 'courser, but he was not one of those coursers of Achilles, who fed on no', 'earthly food, but on the golden barley of heaven, having sprung from the', 'gods--', '', '  [Greek: Xanthon kai Balion, to ama pnoiaesi, petesthaen.', '  Tous eteke Zephuro anemo Arpua Podargae.]', '', 'Dryden resembled rather the mortal steed which was yoked with these', 'immortal twain, the brood of Zephyr and the Harpy Podarga; only we can', 'hardly say of the poet what Homer says of Pedasus--', '', '[Greek: Os kai thnaetos eon, epeth ippois athanatoisi.]', '', 'He was _not_, although a mortal, able to keep up with the immortal', 'coursers. His path was on the plains or table-lands of earth--never or', 'seldom in ""cloudland, gorgeous land,"" or through the aerial altitudes', 'which stretch away and above the clouds to the gates of heaven. He can', 'hardly be said to have possessed the power of sublimity, in the high', 'sense of that term, as the power of sympathising with the feeling of the', 'Infinite. Often he gives us the impression of the picturesque, of the', 'beautiful, of the heroic, of the nobly disdainful--but never (when', 'writing, at least, entirely from his own mind) of that infinite and', 'nameless grandeur which the imaginative soul feels shed on it from the', 'multitudinous waves of ocean--from the cataract leaping from his rock,', 'as if to consummate an act of prayer to God--from the hum of great', 'assemblies of men--from the sight of far-extended wastes and', 'wildernesses--and from the awful silence, and the still more mysterious', 'sparkle of the midnight stars. This sense of the presence of the', '_shadow_ of immensity--immensity itself cannot be felt any more than', 'measured--this sight like that vouchsafed to Moses of the ""backparts"" of', 'the Divine--the Divine itself cannot be seen--has been the inspiration', 'of all the highest poetry of the world--of the ""Paradise Lost,"" of the', '""Divina Commedia,"" of the ""Night Thoughts,"" of Wordsworth and Coleridge,', 'of ""Festus,"" and, highest far, of the Hebrew Prophets, as they cry,', '""Whither can we go from Thy presence? whither can we flee from Thy', 'Spirit?"" Such poets have resembled a blind man, who feels, although he', 'cannot see, that a stranger of commanding air is in the room beside him;', 'so they stand awe-struck in the ""wind of the going"" of a majestic and', 'unseen Being. This feeling differs from mysticism, inasmuch as it is', 'connected with a reality, while the mystic dreams a vague and', 'unsupported dream, and the poetry it produces is simply the irresistible', 'cry springing from the perception of this wondrous Some One who is', 'actually near them.

If I had encouraged him, I should be false; if I had gratified him, I should have acted against my own better resolution and purpose. He was persistent in spite of warning, he despaired without being hated. Bethink you now if it be reasonable that his suffering should be laid to my charge. Let him who has been deceived complain, let him give way to despair whose encouraged hopes have proved vain, let him flatter himself whom I shall entice, let him boast whom I shall receive; but let not him call me cruel or homicide to whom I make no promise, upon whom I practise no deception, whom I neither entice nor receive.

That power of doing everything', 'with perfect and _conscious_ ease, which Dugald Stewart has ascribed to', 'Barrow and to Horsley in prose, distinguished Dryden in poetry. Whether', 'he discusses the deep questions of fate and foreknowledge in ""Religio', 'Laici,"" or lashes Shaftesbury in the ""Medal,"" or pours a torrent of', 'contempt on Shadwell in ""MacFlecknoe,"" or describes the fire of London', 'in the ""Annus Mirabilis,"" or soars into lyric enthusiasm in his ""Ode on', 'the Death of Mrs Killigrew,"" and ""Alexander\'s Feast,"" or paints a', 'tournament in ""Palamon and Arcite,"" or a fairy dance in the ""Flower and', 'the Leaf,""--he is always at home, and always aware that he is. His', 'consciousness of his own powers amounts to exultation. He is like the', 'steed who glories in that tremendous gallop which affects the spectator', ""with fear. Indeed, we never can separate our conception of Dryden's"", 'vigorous and vaulting style from the image of a noble horse, devouring', 'the dust of the field, clearing obstacles at a bound, taking up long', 'leagues as a little thing, and the very strength and speed of whose', 'motion give it at a distance the appearance of smoothness. Pope speaks', 'of his', '', '""Long resounding march, and energy divine.""', '', 'Perhaps ""_ease_ divine"" had been words more characteristic of that', 'almost superhuman power of language by which he makes the most obstinate', 'materials pliant, melts down difficulties as if by the touch of magic,', 'and, to resume the former figure, comes into the goal without a hair', 'turned on his mane, or a single sweat-drop confessing effort or', 'extraordinary exertion. We know no poet since Homer who can be compared', 'to Dryden in this respect, except Scott, who occasionally, in ""Marmion,""', 'and the ""Lay of the Last Minstrel,"" exhibits the same impetuous ease and', 'fiery fluent movement. Scott does not, however, in general, carry the', 'same weight as the other; and the species of verse he uses, in', 'comparison to the heroic rhyme of Dryden, gives you often the impression', 'of a hard trot, rather than of a ""long-resounding"" and magnificent', 'gallop. Scott exhibits in his poetry the soul of a warrior; but it is of', 'a warrior of the Border--somewhat savage and coarse. Dryden can, for the', 'nonce at least, assume the appearance, and display the spirit, of a', 'knight of ancient chivalry--gallant, accomplished, elegant, and gay.', '', ""Next to this poet's astonishing ease, spirit, and elastic vigour, may be"", 'ranked his clear, sharp intellect. He may be called more a logician than', 'a poet. He reasons often, and always acutely, and his rhyme, instead of', 'shackling, strengthens the movement of his argumentation. Parts of his', '""Religio Laici"" and the ""Hind and Panther"" resemble portions of Duns', 'Scotus or Aquinas set on fire. Indeed, keen, strong intellect, inflamed', 'with passion, and inspirited by that ""ardour and impetuosity of mind""', 'which Wordsworth is compelled to allow to him, rather than creative or', 'original genius, is the differentia of Dryden. We have compared him to a', 'courser, but he was not one of those coursers of Achilles, who fed on no', 'earthly food, but on the golden barley of heaven, having sprung from the', 'gods--', '', '  [Greek: Xanthon kai Balion, to ama pnoiaesi, petesthaen.', '  Tous eteke Zephuro anemo Arpua Podargae.]', '', 'Dryden resembled rather the mortal steed which was yoked with these', 'immortal twain, the brood of Zephyr and the Harpy Podarga; only we can', 'hardly say of the poet what Homer says of Pedasus--', '', '[Greek: Os kai thnaetos eon, epeth ippois athanatoisi.]', '', 'He was _not_, although a mortal, able to keep up with the immortal', 'coursers. His path was on the plains or table-lands of earth--never or', 'seldom in ""cloudland, gorgeous land,"" or through the aerial altitudes', 'which stretch away and above the clouds to the gates of heaven. He can', 'hardly be said to have possessed the power of sublimity, in the high', 'sense of that term, as the power of sympathising with the feeling of the', 'Infinite. Often he gives us the impression of the picturesque, of the', 'beautiful, of the heroic, of the nobly disdainful--but never (when', 'writing, at least, entirely from his own mind) of that infinite and', 'nameless grandeur which the imaginative soul feels shed on it from the', 'multitudinous waves of ocean--from the cataract leaping from his rock,', 'as if to consummate an act of prayer to God--from the hum of great', 'assemblies of men--from the sight of far-extended wastes and', 'wildernesses--and from the awful silence, and the still more mysterious', 'sparkle of the midnight stars. This sense of the presence of the', '_shadow_ of immensity--immensity itself cannot be felt any more than', 'measured--this sight like that vouchsafed to Moses of the ""backparts"" of', 'the Divine--the Divine itself cannot be seen--has been the inspiration', 'of all the highest poetry of the world--of the ""Paradise Lost,"" of the', '""Divina Commedia,"" of the ""Night Thoughts,"" of Wordsworth and Coleridge,', 'of ""Festus,"" and, highest far, of the Hebrew Prophets, as they cry,', '""Whither can we go from Thy presence? whither can we flee from Thy', 'Spirit?"" Such poets have resembled a blind man, who feels, although he', 'cannot see, that a stranger of commanding air is in the room beside him;', 'so they stand awe-struck in the ""wind of the going"" of a majestic and', 'unseen Being. This feeling differs from mysticism, inasmuch as it is', 'connected with a reality, while the mystic dreams a vague and', 'unsupported dream, and the poetry it produces is simply the irresistible', 'cry springing from the perception of this wondrous Some One who is', 'actually near them. The feeling is connected, in general, with a lofty', 'moral and religious nature; and yet not always, since, while wanting in', 'Dryden, we find it intensely discovered, although in an imperfect and', 'perverted shape, in By']"

That power of doing everything', 'with perfect and _conscious_ ease, which Dugald Stewart has ascribed to', 'Barrow and to Horsley in prose, distinguished Dryden in poetry. Whether', 'he discusses the deep questions of fate and foreknowledge in ""Religio', 'Laici,"" or lashes Shaftesbury in the ""Medal,"" or pours a torrent of', 'contempt on Shadwell in ""MacFlecknoe,"" or describes the fire of London', 'in the ""Annus Mirabilis,"" or soars into lyric enthusiasm in his ""Ode on', 'the Death of Mrs Killigrew,"" and ""Alexander\'s Feast,"" or paints a', 'tournament in ""Palamon and Arcite,"" or a fairy dance in the ""Flower and', 'the Leaf,""--he is always at home, and always aware that he is. His', 'consciousness of his own powers amounts to exultation. He is like the', 'steed who glories in that tremendous gallop which affects the spectator', ""with fear. Indeed, we never can separate our conception of Dryden's"", 'vigorous and vaulting style from the image of a noble horse, devouring', 'the dust of the field, clearing obstacles at a bound, taking up long', 'leagues as a little thing, and the very strength and speed of whose', 'motion give it at a distance the appearance of smoothness. Pope speaks', 'of his', '', '""Long resounding march, and energy divine.""', '', 'Perhaps ""_ease_ divine"" had been words more characteristic of that', 'almost superhuman power of language by which he makes the most obstinate', 'materials pliant, melts down difficulties as if by the touch of magic,', 'and, to resume the former figure, comes into the goal without a hair', 'turned on his mane, or a single sweat-drop confessing effort or', 'extraordinary exertion. We know no poet since Homer who can be compared', 'to Dryden in this respect, except Scott, who occasionally, in ""Marmion,""', 'and the ""Lay of the Last Minstrel,"" exhibits the same impetuous ease and', 'fiery fluent movement. Scott does not, however, in general, carry the', 'same weight as the other; and the species of verse he uses, in', 'comparison to the heroic rhyme of Dryden, gives you often the impression', 'of a hard trot, rather than of a ""long-resounding"" and magnificent', 'gallop. Scott exhibits in his poetry the soul of a warrior; but it is of', 'a warrior of the Border--somewhat savage and coarse. Dryden can, for the', 'nonce at least, assume the appearance, and display the spirit, of a', 'knight of ancient chivalry--gallant, accomplished, elegant, and gay.', '', ""Next to this poet's astonishing ease, spirit, and elastic vigour, may be"", 'ranked his clear, sharp intellect. He may be called more a logician than', 'a poet. He reasons often, and always acutely, and his rhyme, instead of', 'shackling, strengthens the movement of his argumentation. Parts of his', '""Religio Laici"" and the ""Hind and Panther"" resemble portions of Duns', 'Scotus or Aquinas set on fire. Indeed, keen, strong intellect, inflamed', 'with passion, and inspirited by that ""ardour and impetuosity of mind""', 'which Wordsworth is compelled to allow to him, rather than creative or', 'original genius, is the differentia of Dryden. We have compared him to a', 'courser, but he was not one of those coursers of Achilles, who fed on no', 'earthly food, but on the golden barley of heaven, having sprung from the', 'gods--', '', '  [Greek: Xanthon kai Balion, to ama pnoiaesi, petesthaen.', '  Tous eteke Zephuro anemo Arpua Podargae.]', '', 'Dryden resembled rather the mortal steed which was yoked with these', 'immortal twain, the brood of Zephyr and the Harpy Podarga; only we can', 'hardly say of the poet what Homer says of Pedasus--', '', '[Greek: Os kai thnaetos eon, epeth ippois athanatoisi.]', '', 'He was _not_, although a mortal, able to keep up with the immortal', 'coursers. His path was on the plains or table-lands of earth--never or', 'seldom in ""cloudland, gorgeous land,"" or through the aerial altitudes', 'which stretch away and above the clouds to the gates of heaven. He can', 'hardly be said to have possessed the power of sublimity, in the high', 'sense of that term, as the power of sympathising with the feeling of the', 'Infinite. Often he gives us the impression of the picturesque, of the', 'beautiful, of the heroic, of the nobly disdainful--but never (when', 'writing, at least, entirely from his own mind) of that infinite and', 'nameless grandeur which the imaginative soul feels shed on it from the', 'multitudinous waves of ocean--from the cataract leaping from his rock,', 'as if to consummate an act of prayer to God--from the hum of great', 'assemblies of men--from the sight of far-extended wastes and', 'wildernesses--and from the awful silence, and the still more mysterious', 'sparkle of the midnight stars. This sense of the presence of the', '_shadow_ of immensity--immensity itself cannot be felt any more than', 'measured--this sight like that vouchsafed to Moses of the ""backparts"" of', 'the Divine--the Divine itself cannot be seen--has been the inspiration', 'of all the highest poetry of the world--of the ""Paradise Lost,"" of the', '""Divina Commedia,"" of the ""Night Thoughts,"" of Wordsworth and Coleridge,', 'of ""Festus,"" and, highest far, of the Hebrew Prophets, as they cry,', '""Whither can we go from Thy presence? whither can we flee from Thy', 'Spirit?"" Such poets have resembled a blind man, who feels, although he', 'cannot see, that a stranger of commanding air is in the room beside him;', 'so they stand awe-struck in the ""wind of the going"" of a majestic and', 'unseen Being. This feeling differs from mysticism, inasmuch as it is', 'connected with a reality, while the mystic dreams a vague and', 'unsupported dream, and the poetry it produces is simply the irresistible', 'cry springing from the perception of this wondrous Some One who is', 'actually near them. The feeling is connected, in general, with a lofty', 'moral and religious nature; and yet not always, since, while wanting in', 'Dryden, we find it intensely discovered, although in an imperfect and', 'perverted shape, in By']"

He', 'planned, indeed, too, and partly wrote, one or more plays, and was', 'considered of consequence enough to be elected a member of the Royal', 'Society in 1662. Previous to this he had been introduced, through', 'Herringman, to Sir Robert Howard, son of the first Earl of Berkshire,', 'and a relation of Edward Howard, the author of ""British Princes,"" and', 'the object of the witty wrath of Butler.

That power of doing everything', 'with perfect and _conscious_ ease, which Dugald Stewart has ascribed to', 'Barrow and to Horsley in prose, distinguished Dryden in poetry. Whether', 'he discusses the deep questions of fate and foreknowledge in ""Religio', 'Laici,"" or lashes Shaftesbury in the ""Medal,"" or pours a torrent of', 'contempt on Shadwell in ""MacFlecknoe,"" or describes the fire of London', 'in the ""Annus Mirabilis,"" or soars into lyric enthusiasm in his ""Ode on', 'the Death of Mrs Killigrew,"" and ""Alexander\'s Feast,"" or paints a', 'tournament in ""Palamon and Arcite,"" or a fairy dance in the ""Flower and', 'the Leaf,""--he is always at home, and always aware that he is. His', 'consciousness of his own powers amounts to exultation. He is like the', 'steed who glories in that tremendous gallop which affects the spectator', ""with fear. Indeed, we never can separate our conception of Dryden's"", 'vigorous and vaulting style from the image of a noble horse, devouring', 'the dust of the field, clearing obstacles at a bound, taking up long', 'leagues as a little thing, and the very strength and speed of whose', 'motion give it at a distance the appearance of smoothness.

We know no poet since Homer who can be compared', 'to Dryden in this respect, except Scott, who occasionally, in ""Marmion,""', 'and the ""Lay of the Last Minstrel,"" exhibits the same impetuous ease and', 'fiery fluent movement.

Scott exhibits in his poetry the soul of a warrior; but it is of', 'a warrior of the Border--somewhat savage and coarse. Dryden can, for the', 'nonce at least, assume the appearance, and display the spirit, of a', 'knight of ancient chivalry--gallant, accomplished, elegant, and gay.', '', ""Next to this poet's astonishing ease, spirit, and elastic vigour, may be"", 'ranked his clear, sharp intellect.

Indeed, keen, strong intellect, inflamed', 'with passion, and inspirited by that ""ardour and impetuosity of mind""', 'which Wordsworth is compelled to allow to him, rather than creative or', 'original genius, is the differentia of Dryden. We have compared him to a', 'courser, but he was not one of those coursers of Achilles, who fed on no', 'earthly food, but on the golden barley of heaven, having sprung from the', 'gods--', '', '  [Greek: Xanthon kai Balion, to ama pnoiaesi, petesthaen.', '  Tous eteke Zephuro anemo Arpua Podargae.]', '', 'Dryden resembled rather the mortal steed which was yoked with these', 'immortal twain, the brood of Zephyr and the Harpy Podarga; only we can', 'hardly say of the poet what Homer says of Pedasus--', '', '[Greek: Os kai thnaetos eon, epeth ippois athanatoisi.]', '', 'He was _not_, although a mortal, able to keep up with the immortal', 'coursers. His path was on the plains or table-lands of earth--never or', 'seldom in ""cloudland, gorgeous land,"" or through the aerial altitudes', 'which stretch away and above the clouds to the gates of heaven. He can', 'hardly be said to have possessed the power of sublimity, in the high', 'sense of that term, as the power of sympathising with the feeling of the', 'Infinite. Often he gives us the impression of the picturesque, of the', 'beautiful, of the heroic, of the nobly disdainful--but never (when', 'writing, at least, entirely from his own mind) of that infinite and', 'nameless grandeur which the imaginative soul feels shed on it from the', 'multitudinous waves of ocean--from the cataract leaping from his rock,', 'as if to consummate an act of prayer to God--from the hum of great', 'assemblies of men--from the sight of far-extended wastes and', 'wildernesses--and from the awful silence, and the still more mysterious', 'sparkle of the midnight stars. This sense of the presence of the', '_shadow_ of immensity--immensity itself cannot be felt any more than', 'measured--this sight like that vouchsafed to Moses of the ""backparts"" of', 'the Divine--the Divine itself cannot be seen--has been the inspiration', 'of all the highest poetry of the world--of the ""Paradise Lost,"" of the', '""Divina Commedia,"" of the ""Night Thoughts,"" of Wordsworth and Coleridge,', 'of ""Festus,"" and, highest far, of the Hebrew Prophets, as they cry,', '""Whither can we go from Thy presence? whither can we flee from Thy', 'Spirit?"" Such poets have resembled a blind man, who feels, although he', 'cannot see, that a stranger of commanding air is in the room beside him;', 'so they stand awe-struck in the ""wind of the going"" of a majestic and', 'unseen Being. This feeling differs from mysticism, inasmuch as it is', 'connected with a reality, while the mystic dreams a vague and', 'unsupported dream, and the poetry it produces is simply the irresistible', 'cry springing from the perception of this wondrous Some One who is', 'actually near them. The feeling is connected, in general, with a lofty', 'moral and religious nature; and yet not always, since, while wanting in', 'Dryden, we find it intensely discovered, although in an imperfect and', 'perverted shape, in By']"
