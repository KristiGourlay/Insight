thankful for the bequest and just the same as confessing it and publishing it right in the face of the prohibition for the rest of the day sally made havoc and confusion with his books and aleck could not keep her mind on her affairs not even take up a flower pot or book or a stick of wood without forgetting what she had intended to do with it for both were dreaming thir ty thousand dollars all day long the music of those inspiring words sang through those people s heads from his marriage day forth aleck s grip had been upon the purse and sally had seldom known what it was to be privileged to squander a dime on non necessities thir ty thousand dollars the song went on and on a vast sum an unthinkable sum all day long aleck was absorbed in planning how to invest it sally in planning how to spend it there was no romance reading that night the children took themselves away early for their parents were silent distraught and strangely unentertaining the good night kisses might as well have been impressed upon vacancy for all the response they got the parents were not aware of the kisses and the children had been gone an hour before their absence was noticed two pencils had been busy during that hour note making in the way of plans it was sally who broke the stillness at last he said with exultation ah it ll be grand aleck out of the first thousand we ll have a horse and a buggy for summer and a cutter and a skin lap robe for winter aleck responded with decision and composure out of the capital nothing of the kind not if it was a million sally was deeply disappointed the glow went out of his face oh aleck he said reproachfully we ve always worked so hard and been so scrimped and now that we are rich it does seem he did not finish for he saw her eye soften his supplication had touched her she said with gentle persuasiveness we must not spend the capital dear it would not be wise out of the income from it that will answer that will answer aleck how dear and good you are there will be a noble income and if we can spend that not all of it dear not all of it but you can spend a part of it that is a reasonable part but the whole of the capital every penny of it must be put right to work and kept at it you see the reasonableness of that don t you why ye s yes of course but we ll have to wait so long six months before the first interest falls due yes maybe longer longer aleck why don t they pay half yearly that kind of an investment yes but i sha n t invest in that way what way then for big returns big that s good go on aleck what is it coal the new mines cannel i mean to put in ten thousand ground floor when we organize we ll get three shares for one by george but it sounds good aleck then the shares will be worth how much and when about a year they ll pay ten per cent half yearly and be worth thirty thousand i know all about it the advertisement is in the cincinnati paper here land thirty thousand for ten in a year let s jam in the whole capital and pull out ninety i ll write and subscribe right now tomorrow it maybe too late he was flying to the writing desk but aleck stopped him and put him back in his chair she said don t lose your head so we mustn t subscribe till we ve got the money don t you know that sally s excitement went down a degree or two but he was not wholly appeased why aleck we ll have it you know and so soon too he s probably out of his troubles before this it s a hundred to nothing he s selecting his brimstone shovel this very minute now i think aleck shuddered and said how can you sally don t talk in that way it is perfectly scandalous oh well make it a halo if you like i don t care for his outfit i was only just talking can t you let a person talk but why should you want to talk in that dreadful way how would you like to have people talk so about you and you not cold yet not likely to be for one while i reckon if my last act was giving away money for the sake of doing somebody a harm with it but never mind about tilbury aleck let s talk about something worldly it does seem to me that that mine is the place for the whole thirty what s the objection all the eggs in one basket that s the objection all right if you say so what about the other twenty what do you mean to do with that there is no hurry i am going to look around before i do anything with it all right if your mind s made up signed sally he was deep in thought awhile then he said there ll be twenty thousand profit coming from the ten a year from now we can spend that can we aleck aleck shook her head no dear she said it won t sell high till we ve had the first semi annual dividend you can spend part of that shucks only that and a whole year to wait confound it i oh do be patient it might even be declared in three months it s quite within the possibilities oh jolly oh thanks and sally jumped up and kissed his wife in gratitude it ll be three thousand three whole thousand how much of it can we spend aleck make it liberal do dear that s a good fellow aleck was pleased so pleased that she yielded to the pressure and conceded a sum which her judgment told her was a foolish extravagance a thousand dollars sally kissed her half a dozen times and even in that way could not express all his joy and thankfulness this new access of gratitude and affection carried aleck quite beyond the bounds of prudence and before she could restrain herself she had made her darling another grant a couple of thousand out of the fifty or sixty which she meant to clear within a year of the twenty which still remained of the bequest the happy

here isn t it besides i have never seen anything so beautiful as this house i think it frightened me a little he laid his hand upon hers kindly i imagine he said smiling that you will very soon get used to this you will have the opportunity if you choose she laughed softly if i choose she repeated why it is all like fairyland to me he nodded you come he said from a very quiet life you will find things here different do you know what these are he touched a little row of black instruments which stood on the top of his desk she shook her head doubtfully i am not quite sure she admitted they are telephones he said this one touching the first is a private wire to my offices in wall street this one laying a finger upon the second is a private wire to the bank of which i am president these two he continued are connected with the two brokers whom i employ the other three are ordinary telephones two for long distance calls and one for the city when you came in i touched this knob on the floor beneath my foot all the telephones were at once disconnected here and connected with my secretaries room i can sit here at this table and shake the money markets of the world i can send stocks up or down at my will i can ruin if i like or i can enrich it is the fashion nowadays to speak lightly of the mere man of money yet there is no king on his throne who can shake the world as can we kings of the money market by the lifting even of a finger are you a millionaire she asked timidly but of course you must be or you could not live in a house like this he laid his hand gently upon hers yes he said i am a millionaire a good many times over or i should not be of much account in new york but there i have told you enough about myself i sent for you as you know because there are times when i feel a little lonely and i thought that if my sister could spare one of her children it would be a kindly act and one which i might perhaps be able to repay do you think that you would like to live here with me virginia and be mistress of this house she shrank a little away the prospect was not without its terrifying side why i should love it she declared but i simply shouldn t dare to think of it you don t understand i am afraid the way we live down at wellham springs we have really no servants and we do everything ourselves i couldn t attempt to manage a house like this he smiled at her kindly perhaps he said you would find it less difficult than you think there is a housekeeper already who sees to all the practical part of it she only needs to have some one to whom she can refer now and then you would have nothing whatever to do with the managing of the servants the commissariat or anything of that sort yours would be purely social duties i am afraid she answered that i should know even less about them well he said i have some good friends who will give you hints you will find it very much easier than you imagine you have only to be natural acquire the art of listening and wear pretty gowns and you will find it a simple matter to become quite a popular person she nerved herself to ask him a question he looked so kind and good natured that it did not seem possible that he would resent it uncle she said of course i am very glad to be here and it all sounds very delightful but what about stella he leaned back in his chair there was a pained look in his face she was almost sorry that she had mentioned his daughter s name perhaps he said it is as well that you should have asked me that question i have always been an indulgent father as i think you will find me an indulgent uncle but there are certain things certain offences i might say for which i have no forgiveness stella deceived me she made use of information secret information which she acquired in this room to benefit some man in whom she was interested she used my secrets to enrich this person she did this after i had warned her i never warn twice you mean that you sent her away she asked timidly i mean that my doors are closed to her he answered gravely as they would be closed upon you if you behaved as stella has behaved but my dear child he added smiling kindly at her i do not expect this from you i feel sure that what i have said will be sufficient if you will stay with me a little time and take my daughter s place i think you will not find me very stern or very ungrateful now i am going to ring for mrs perrin my housekeeper and she will show you your room to night you and i are going to dine quite alone and we can talk again then by the by do you really mean that you have never been to new york before never she answered i have been to boston twice never anywhere else he smiled well he said the sooner you are introduced to some of its wonders the better we will dine out to night and i will take you to one of the famous restaurants it will suit me better to be somewhere out of the way for an hour or two this evening there is a panic in chicago and illinois but there you wouldn t understand that be ready at o clock but uncle she began he waved his hand i know what you are going to say clothes you will find some evening dresses in your room i have had a collection of things sent round on approval and you will probably be able to find one you can wear ah here is mrs perrin the door had opened and a middle aged lady in a stiff black silk gown had entered the room

begin by making a deep bite and then another just a little way below then he would pry out the little piece of wood between when he had cut very deep on one side so that the tree would fall that way he would work around to the other side just as soon as the tree began to lean and he was sure that it was going to fall he would scamper away so as to be out of danger he loved to see those tall trees lean forward slowly then faster and faster till they struck the ground with a crash just as soon as they were down he would trim off the branches until the trees where just long poles this was easy work for he could take off a good sized branch with one bite on many he left their bushy tops when he had trimmed them to suit him and had cut them into the right lengths he would tug and pull them down to the place where he meant to build his dam there he placed the poles side by side not across the laughing brook like a bridge but with the big ends pointing up the laughing brook which was quite broad but shallow right there to keep them from floating away he rolled stones and piled mud on the bushy ends clear across on both sides he laid those poles until the water began to rise then he dragged more poles and piled them on top of these and wedged short sticks crosswise between them and all the time the laughing brook was having harder and harder work to run its merry laugh grew less merry and finally almost stopped because you see the water could not get through between all those poles and sticks fast enough it was just about that time that the little people of the smiling pool decided that it was time to see just what paddy was doing and they started up the laughing brook leaving only grandfather frog and the tadpoles in the smiling pool which for a little while would smile no more chapter iii paddy has many visitors paddy the beaver knew perfectly well that he would have visitors just as soon as he began to build his dam he expected a lot of them you see he knew that none of them ever had seen a beaver at work unless perhaps it was prickly porky the porcupine who also had come down from the north so as he worked he kept his ears open and he smiled to himself as he heard a little rustle here and then a little rustle there he knew just what those little rustles meant each one meant another visitor yes sir each rustle meant another visitor and yet not one had shown himself paddy chuckled seems to me that you are dreadfully afraid to show yourselves said he in a loud voice just as if he were talking to nobody in particular everything was still there wasn t so much as a rustle after paddy spoke he chuckled again he could just feel ever so many eyes watching him though he didn t see a single pair and he knew that the reason his visitors were hiding so carefully was because they were afraid of him you see paddy was much bigger than most of the little meadow and forest people and they didn t know what kind of a temper he might have it is always safest to be very distrustful of strangers that is one of the very first things taught all little meadow and forest children of course paddy knew all about this he had been brought up that way be sure and then you ll never be sorry had been one of his mother s favorite sayings and he had always remembered it indeed it had saved him a great deal of trouble so now he was perfectly willing to go right on working and let his hidden visitors watch him until they were sure that he meant them no harm you see he himself felt quite sure that none of them was big enough to do him any harm little joe otter was the only one he had any doubts about and he felt quite sure that little joe wouldn t try to pick a quarrel so he kept right on cutting trees trimming off the branches and hauling the trunks down to the dam he was building some of them he floated down the laughing brook this was easier now when the little people of the smiling pool who were the first to find out that paddy the beaver had come to the green forest had started up the laughing brook to see what he was doing they had told the merry little breezes where they were going the merry little breezes had been greatly excited they couldn t understand how a stranger could have been living in the green forest without their knowledge you see they quite forgot that they very seldom wandered to the deepest part of the green forest of course they started at once as fast as they could go to tell all the other little people who live on or around the green meadows all but old man coyote for some reason they thought it best not to tell him they were a little doubtful about old man coyote he was so big and strong and so sly and smart that all his neighbors were afraid of him perhaps the merry little breezes had this fact in mind and knew that none would dare go to call on the stranger if they knew that old man coyote was going too anyway they simply passed the time of day with old mr coyote and hurried on to tell everyone else and the very last one they met was sammy jay chapter iv sammy jay speaks his mind when sammy jay reached the place deep in the green forest where paddy the beaver was so hard at work he didn t hide as had the little four footed people you see of course he had no reason to hide because he felt perfectly safe paddy had just cut a big tree and it fell with a crash as sammy came hurrying up sammy was so surprised that for a minute he couldn t find his tongue he had not supposed that anybody but farmer brown or farmer brown s boy could cut down so large a tree as that and it quite took his breath away but he got it again in a minute he was boiling with anger anyway to think that he should have been the last to learn that paddy had come down from the north to make his home in the

for deciding between the various principles when they conflict ought to be self evident to inquire how far the bad effects of this deficiency have been mitigated in practice or to what extent the moral beliefs of mankind have been vitiated or made uncertain by the absence of any distinct recognition of an ultimate standard would imply a complete survey and criticism of past and present ethical doctrine it would however be easy to show that whatever steadiness or consistency these moral beliefs have attained has been mainly due to the tacit influence of a standard not recognised although the non existence of an acknowledged first principle has made ethics not so much a guide as a consecration of men s actual sentiments still as men s sentiments both of favour and of aversion are greatly influenced by what they suppose to be the effects of things upon their happiness the principle of utility or as bentham latterly called it the greatest happiness principle has had a large share in forming the moral doctrines even of those who most scornfully reject its authority nor is there any school of thought which refuses to admit that the influence of actions on happiness is a most material and even predominant consideration in many of the details of morals however unwilling to acknowledge it as the fundamental principle of morality and the source of moral obligation i might go much further and say that to all those xa priori moralists who deem it necessary to argue at all utilitarian arguments are indispensable it is not my present purpose to criticise these thinkers but i cannot help referring for illustration to a systematic treatise by one of the most illustrious of them the metaphysics of ethics by kant this remarkable man whose system of thought will long remain one of the landmarks in the history of philosophical speculation does in the treatise in question lay down an universal first principle as the origin and ground of moral obligation it is this so act that the rule on which thou actest would admit of being adopted as a law by all rational beings but when he begins to deduce from this precept any of the actual duties of morality he fails almost grotesquely to show that there would be any contradiction any logical not to say physical impossibility in the adoption by all rational beings of the most outrageously immoral rules of conduct all he shows is that the consequences of their universal adoption would be such as no one would choose to incur on the present occasion i shall without further discussion of the other theories attempt to contribute something towards the understanding and appreciation of the utilitarian or happiness theory and towards such proof as it is susceptible of it is evident that this cannot be proof in the ordinary and popular meaning of the term questions of ultimate ends are not amenable to direct proof whatever can be proved to be good must be so by being shown to be a means to something admitted to be good without proof the medical art is proved to be good by its conducing to health but how is it possible to prove that health is good the art of music is good for the reason among others that it produces pleasure but what proof is it possible to give that pleasure is good if then it is asserted that there is a comprehensive formula including all things which are in themselves good and that whatever else is good is not so as an end but as a mean the formula may be accepted or rejected but is not a subject of what is commonly understood by proof we are not however to infer that its acceptance or rejection must depend on blind impulse or arbitrary choice there is a larger meaning of the word proof in which this question is as amenable to it as any other of the disputed questions of philosophy the subject is within the cognizance of the rational faculty and neither does that faculty deal with it solely in the way of intuition considerations may be presented capable of determining the intellect either to give or withhold its assent to the doctrine and this is equivalent to proof we shall examine presently of what nature are these considerations in what manner they apply to the case and what rational grounds therefore can be given for accepting or rejecting the utilitarian formula but it is a preliminary condition of rational acceptance or rejection that the formula should be correctly understood i believe that the very imperfect notion ordinarily formed of its meaning is the chief obstacle which impedes its reception and that could it be cleared even from only the grosser misconceptions the question would be greatly simplified and a large proportion of its difficulties removed before therefore i attempt to enter into the philosophical grounds which can be given for assenting to the utilitarian standard i shall offer some illustrations of the doctrine itself with the view of showing more clearly what it is distinguishing it from what it is not and disposing of such of the practical objections to it as either originate in or are closely connected with mistaken interpretations of its meaning having thus prepared the ground i shall afterwards endeavour to throw such light as i can upon the question considered as one of philosophical theory chapter ii what utilitarianism is a passing remark is all that needs be given to the ignorant blunder of supposing that those who stand up for utility as the test of right and wrong use the term in that restricted and merely colloquial sense in which utility is opposed to pleasure an apology is due to the philosophical opponents of utilitarianism for even the momentary appearance of confounding them with any one capable of so absurd a misconception which is the more extraordinary

the older allow me to give you the path dropping his head again he turns to the left english fashion and trots slowly past you there is no hurry not the shadow of suspicion or uneasiness his eyes are cast down his brow wrinkled as if in deep thought already he seems to have forgotten your existence you watch him curiously as he reenters the path behind you and disappears over the hill somehow a queer feeling half wonder half rebuke steals over you as if you had been outdone in courtesy or had passed a gentleman without sufficiently recognizing him ah but you didn t watch sharply enough you didn t see as he circled past that cunning side gleam of his yellow eyes which understood your attitude perfectly had you stirred he would have vanished like a flash you didn t run to the top of the hill where he disappeared to see that burst of speed the instant he was out of your sight you didn t see the capers the tail chasing the high jumps the quick turns and plays and then the straight nervous gallop which told more plainly than words his exultation that he had outwitted you and shown his superiority reynard wherever you meet him whether on the old road at twilight or on the runway before the hounds impresses you as an animal of dignity and calculation he never seems surprised much less frightened never loses his head never does things hurriedly or on the spur of the moment as a scatter brained rabbit or meddling squirrel might do you meet him perhaps as he leaves the warm rock on the south slope of the old oak woods where he has been curled up asleep all the sunny afternoon it is easy to find him there in winter now he is off on his nightly hunt he is trotting along head down brows deep wrinkled planning it all out let me see he is thinking last night i hunted the draper woods to night i ll cross the brook just this side the old bars and take a look into that pasture corner among the junipers there s a rabbit which plays round there on moonlight nights i ll have him presently then i ll go down to the big south meadow after mice i haven t been there for a week and last time i got six if i don t find mice there s that chicken coop of old jenkins only he stops with his foot up and listens a minute only he locks the coop and leaves the dog loose ever since i took the big rooster anyway i ll take a look round there sometimes deacon jones s hens get to roosting in the next orchard if i can find them up an apple tree i ll bring a couple down with a good trick i know on the way hi there in the midst of his planning he gives a grasshopper jump aside and brings down both paws hard on a bit of green moss that quivered as he passed he spreads his paws apart carefully thrusts his nose down between them drags a young wood mouse from under the moss eats him licks his chops twice and goes on planning as if nothing had happened on the way back i ll swing round by the fales place and take a sniff under the wall by the old hickory to see if those sleepy skunks are still there for the winter i ll have that whole family before spring if i m hungry and can t find anything else they come out on sunny days all you have to do is just hide behind the hickory and watch so off he goes on his well planned hunt and if you follow his track to morrow in the snow you will see how he has gone from one hunting ground directly to the next you will find the depression where he lay in a clump of tall dead grass and watched a while for the rabbit reckon the number of mice he caught in the meadow see his sly tracks about the chicken coop and in the orchard and pause a moment at the spot where he cast a knowing look behind the hickory by the wall all just as he planned it on his way to the brook if on the other hand you stand by one of his runways while the dogs are driving him expecting of course to see him come tearing along in a desperate hurry frightened out of half his wits by the savage uproar behind him you can only rub your eyes in wonder when a fluffy yellow ball comes drifting through the woods towards you as if the breeze were blowing it along there he is trotting down the runway in the same leisurely self possessed way wrapped in his own thoughts apparently the same deep wrinkles over his eyes he played a trick or two on a brook down between the ponds by jumping about on a lot of stones from which the snow had melted without wetting his feet which he dislikes and without leaving a track anywhere while the dogs are puzzling that out he has plenty of time to plan more devices on his way to the big hill with its brook and old walls and rail fences and dry places under the pines and twenty other helps to an active brain first he will run round the hill half a dozen times crisscrossing his trail that of itself will drive the young dogs crazy then along the top rail of a fence and a long jump into the junipers which hold no scent and another jump to the wall where there is no snow and then oh plenty of time no hurry he says to himself turning to listen a moment that dog with the big voice must be old roby he thinks he knows all about foxes just because he broke his leg last year trying to walk a sheep fence where i d been i ll give him another chance and oh yes i ll creep up the other side of the hill and curl up on a warm rock on the tiptop and watch them all break their heads over the crisscross and have a good nap or two and think of more tricks so he trots past you still planning crosses the wall by a certain stone that he has used ever since he was a cub f

autobiographical preface wherein the wayside was to be described after the manner of his introduction to the mosses from an old manse but so far as is known nothing of this was ever actually committed to paper beginning with the idea of producing an english romance fragments of which remain to us in the ancestral footstep and the incomplete work known as doctor grimshawe s secret he replaced these by another design of which septimius felton represents the partial execution but that elaborate study yielded in its turn to the dolliver romance the last named work had the author lived to carry it out would doubtless have become the vehicle of a profound and pathetic drama based on the instinctive yearning of man for an immortal existence the attempted gratification of which would have been set forth in a variety of ways first through the selfish old sensualist colonel dabney who greedily seized the mysterious elixir and took such a draught of it that he perished on the spot then through the simple old grandsir anxious to live for pansie s sake and perhaps through pansie herself who coming into the enjoyment of some ennobling love would wish to defeat death so that she might always keep the perfection of her mundane happiness all these forms of striving to be made the adumbration of a higher one the shadow play that should direct our minds to the true immortality beyond this world g p l the dolliver romance a scene from the dolliver romance dr dolliver a worthy personage of extreme antiquity was aroused rather prematurely one summer morning by the shouts of the child pansie in an adjoining chamber summoning old martha who performed the duties of nurse housekeeper and kitchen maid in the doctor s establishment to take up her little ladyship and dress her the old gentleman woke with more than his customary alacrity and after taking a moment to gather his wits about him pulled aside the faded moreen curtains of his ancient bed and thrust his head into a beam of sunshine that caused him to wink and withdraw it again this transitory glimpse of good dr dolliver showed a flannel night cap fringed round with stray locks of silvery white hair and surmounting a meagre and duskily yellow visage which was crossed and criss crossed with a record of his long life in wrinkles faithfully written no doubt but with such cramped chirography of father time that the purport was illegible it seemed hardly worth while for the patriarch to get out of bed any more and bring his forlorn shadow into the summer day that was made for younger folks the doctor however was by no means of that opinion being considerably encouraged towards the toil of living twenty four hours longer by the comparative ease with which he found himself going through the usually painful process of bestirring his rusty joints stiffened by the very rest and sleep that should have made them pliable and putting them in a condition to bear his weight upon the floor nor was he absolutely disheartened by the idea of those tonsorial ablutionary and personally decorative labors which are apt to become so intolerably irksome to an old gentleman after performing them daily and daily for fifty sixty or seventy years and finding them still as immitigably recurrent as at first dr dolliver could nowise account for this happy condition of his spirits and physical energies until he remembered taking an experimental sip of a certain cordial which was long ago prepared by his grandson and carefully sealed up in a bottle and had been reposited in a dark closet among a parcel of effete medicines ever since that gifted young man s death it may have wrought effect upon me thought the doctor shaking his head as he lifted it again from the pillow it may be so for poor edward oftentimes instilled a strange efficacy into his perilous drugs but i will rather believe it to be the operation of god s mercy which may have temporarily invigorated my feeble age for little pansie s sake a twinge of his familiar rheumatism as he put his foot out of bed taught him that he must not reckon too confidently upon even a day s respite from the intrusive family of aches and infirmities which with their proverbial fidelity to attachments once formed had long been the closest acquaintances that the poor old gentleman had in the world nevertheless he fancied the twinge a little less poignant than those of yesterday and moreover after stinging him pretty smartly it passed gradually off with a thrill which in its latter stages grew to be almost agreeable pain is but pleasure too strongly emphasized with cautious movements and only a groan or two the good doctor transferred himself from the bed to the floor where he stood awhile gazing from one piece of quaint furniture to another such as stiff backed mayflower chairs an oaken chest of drawers carved cunningly with shapes of animals and wreaths of foliage a table with multitudinous legs a family record in faded embroidery a shelf of black bound books a dirty heap of gallipots and phials in a dim corner gazing at these things and steadying himself by the bedpost while his inert brain still partially benumbed with sleep came slowly into accordance with the realities about him the object which most helped to bring dr dolliver completely to his waking perceptions was one that common observers might suppose to have been snatched bodily

at once and break out your baggage have it up at the store to morrow morning sharp she took his hand lightly and stepped aboard her weight gave the leaky boat a sudden lurch and the water hurtled across the bottom boards to her shoe tops but she took it coolly enough settling herself in the stern sheets and tucking her feet under her hold on the officer cried this will never do miss welse come on back and i ll get one of our boats over as soon as i can i ll see you in in heaven first retorted the boatman shoving off let go he threatened mr thurston gripped tight hold of the gunwale and as reward for his chivalry had his knuckles rapped sharply by the oar blade then he forgot himself and miss welse also and swore and swore fervently i dare say our farewell might have been more dignified

in the gray eyes of frona welse he was not analytical he did not know why but he knew that with her he could travel to the end of the earth he felt a distaste for his profession and a temptation to throw it all over and strike out for the klondike whither she was going then he glanced up the beetling side of the ship saw the red face of thad ferguson and forgot the dream he had for an instant dreamed splash a handful of water from his strenuous oar struck her full in the face hope you don t mind it miss he apologized i m doin the best i know how which ain t much so it seems she answered

for he ll be arrested no no don t cried ned he d be sure to kill me if you should do that an then what good would it do me but you hain t goin to let him carry you off be you oh i don t know said ned and he began to cry piteously again while joe tried to soothe him by wiping away the big tears with the cuff of his jacket i think you d better let me tell the captain he said i can t cause he knows another man on the boat an one of them would be sure to kill me why won t you let me just go with you i would if i knew where i was goin but you see i m most as bad off as you are and then joe told him of his misfortune in having become an involuntary passenger concluding his story by saying an i ve got a mother that ll feel just as bad as yours will it will be worse for her too cause she says now that father s dead i m all that she s got an every cent i make i carry home to her cause she has to work hard to get money to pay the rent joe could understand very readily by ned s clothing that their homes were widely different had it not been for his uniform the messenger boy would have worn a very shabby suit of clothes while ned was not only dressed expensively but he wore what was to joe the very height of extravagance a gold ring even if you don t know where you re goin take me with you said ned if you d help me i d try to get away from that man there he comes now don t let him whip me i ll go off so s he won t know we ve been talkin an just as soon as he leaves again i ll come back said he he had just time enough to dart behind a pile of baggage before the man came up and he needed but one glance to convince him that ned had good cause for fear the man s face was so brutal looking that even he began to think perhaps it might not be advisable to appeal to the captain of the steamer lest the story should not be believed and he be called to an account for interfering the valises were still where he had left them and marching boldly out but feeling quite the reverse of what he tried to assume he took the baggage not heeding the pleading look ned gave him and went to the stateroom where he remained some time trying to make up his mind what he could do to aid the boy who had appealed to him he did not for a moment entertain the idea of leaving him with that man suddenly what seemed to be a very brilliant idea came to him and he walked down stairs on to the main deck again leaving the door of the stateroom unlocked the man was seated by ned s side smoking and joe went from one place to another keeping the couple in sight all the while until he saw him walk away with a companion who spoke to him and looked quite as detestable as he joe made sure that the two had gone into the lower cabin and running quickly to where ned sat he said come up stairs with me as fast as you can an i ll show you what to do then taking the little fellow by the hand he hurried to the upper deck not looking around and hardly daring to breathe until they were in the stateroom with the door securely fastened and the blind of the window closed there he exclaimed triumphantly in a whisper i guess this fixes mr man an when he tries to find you he ll think that stealin boys hain t so easy as he thought it was but he ll come up here to get me said ned hoping that there was an opportunity for him to escape yet frightened at the step he had taken he may come up stairs but how can he find you see here ned i ve got two tickets for the passage in my pocket an the room s been paid for by the man i told you about now we can keep in here till the boat stops and then i guess we can give him the slip but i hain t thought yet how we either of us can get home but s posen he comes right up here to the door he w n t do that can t you see ned that he don t know anything more about this room than he does of any other we re all right for awhile anyhow but i guess we ll be pretty hungry cause we can t get anything to eat i don t care bout that if he don t get hold of me

he could not find ned and finally the first novelty of the situation having passed away they talked of their homes it was the most unwise thing they could have done so far as peace of mind was

the stars bespangled the sky like diamond dust the water was as clear as a mirror and the lights of nice seemed to shoot far down into its depths the hum of the city came off with ever deepening softness as the distance from the shore increased the occasional sound of oars was heard not far off though boats and rowers were invisible for there was no moon and the night was dark notwithstanding the starlight there was no fear however of the young sailor losing himself while the city lights formed such a glorious beacon astern after pulling steadily for an hour or more he rested on his oars gazed up at the bright heavens and then at the land lights which by that time resembled a twinkling line on the horizon must bout ship now he muttered won t do to keep minnie waiting as he rowed leisurely landward a sudden gust of wind from the shore shivered the liquid mirror into fragments it was the advance guard of a squall which in a few minutes rushed down from the mountains of the riviera and swept out upon the darkening sea young foster as we have said was strong he was noted among his fellows as a splendid oarsman the squall therefore did not disconcert him though it checked his speed greatly after one or two lulls the wind increased to a gale and in half an hour the youth found with some anxiety that he was making no headway against it the shore at that point was so much of a straight line as to render the hope of being able to slant in a faint one as it was better however to attempt that than to row straight in the teeth of the gale he diverged towards a point a little to the eastward of the port of nice and succeeded in making better way through the water though he made no perceptible approach to land pooh it s only a squall be over in a minute said the middy by way of encouraging himself as he glanced over his shoulder at the flickering lights which were now barely visible he was wrong the gale increased next time he glanced over his shoulder the lights were gone dark clouds were gathering up from the northward and a short jabble of sea was rising which occasionally sent a spurt of spray inboard feeling now that his only chance of regaining the shore lay in a strong steady persevering pull straight towards it he once more turned the bow of the little boat into the wind s eye and gave way with a will but what could human muscle and human will however powerful do against a rampant nor wester very soon our hero was forced to rest upon his oars from sheer exhaustion while his boat drifted slowly out to sea then the thought of his mother and minnie flashed upon him and with a sudden gush as it were of renewed strength he resumed his efforts and strained his powers to the uttermost but all in vain something akin to despair now seized on him for the alternative was to drift out into the open sea where no friendly island lay between him and the shores of africa the necessity for active exertion however gave him no time either to rest or think as the distance from land increased the seas rose higher and broke so frequently over the boat that it began to fill to stop rowing at least to the extent of keeping the bow to the wind would have risked turning broadside on and being overturned or swamped there was nothing therefore to be done in the circumstances except to keep the boat s head to the wind and drift in the midst of the rushing gale and surging seas he sat there every gleam of hope almost extinguished when there came to his mind a brief passage from the bible hope thou in god many a time had his mother tried in days gone by to impress that text on his mind but apparently without success now it arose before him like a beacon star at the same time he thought of the possibility that he might be seen and picked up by a passing vessel he could not but feel however that the chances of this latter event occurring were small indeed for a passing ship or boat would not only be going at great speed but would be very unlikely to see his cockle shell in the darkness or to hear his cry in the roaring gale still he grasped that hope as the drowning man is said to clutch at a straw and the hope was quickly fulfilled for scarcely had another half hour elapsed when he observed a sail the high peaked sail peculiar to some mediterranean craft rise ghost like out of the driving foam and spray the vessel was making almost straight for him he knew that it would pass before there could be time to heave a rope at the risk of being run down he rowed the punt in front of it as if courting destruction but at the same time guided his little craft so skilfully that it passed close to leeward where the vessel s bulwarks were dipping into the water our middy s aim was so exact that the vessel only grazed the boat as it flew past in that moment young foster sprang with the agility of a cat capsized the boat with the impulse caught the bulwarks and rigging of the vessel and in another moment stood panting on her deck hallo neptune what do you want here cried a gruff voice at foster s elbows at the same time a powerful hand grasped his throat and a lantern was thrust in his face let go and i will tell you gasped the youth restraining his indignation at such unnecessary violence the grasp tightened however instead of relaxing speak out baby face roared the voice referring in the latter expression no

indeed an awesome spectacle as he crept after me on his ten short muscular legs but to me he was the embodiment of love and loyalty the figure ahead was that of the black dator of the first born thurid whose undying enmity i had earned that time i laid him low with my bare hands in the courtyard of the temple of issus and bound him with his own harness before the noble men and women who had but a moment before been extolling his prowess like many of his fellows he had apparently accepted the new order of things with good grace and had sworn fealty to xodar his new ruler but i knew that he hated me and i was sure that in his heart he envied and hated xodar so i had kept a watch upon his comings and goings to the end that of late i had become convinced that he was occupied with some manner of intrigue several times i had observed him leaving the walled city of the first born after dark taking his way out into the cruel and horrible valley dor where no honest business could lead any man tonight he moved quickly along the edge of the forest until well beyond sight or sound of the city then he turned across the crimson sward toward the shore of the lost sea of korus the rays of the nearer moon swinging low across the valley touched his jewel incrusted harness with a thousand changing lights and glanced from the glossy ebony of his smooth hide twice he turned his head back toward the forest after the manner of one who is upon an evil errand though he must have felt quite safe from pursuit i did not dare follow him there beneath the moonlight since it best suited my plans not to interrupt his i wished him to reach his destination unsuspecting that i might learn just where that destination lay and the business that awaited the night prowler there so it was that i remained hidden until after thurid had disappeared over the edge of the steep bank beside the sea a quarter of a mile away then with woola following i hastened across the open after the black dator the quiet of the tomb lay upon the mysterious valley of death crouching deep in its warm nest within the sunken area at the south pole of the dying planet in the far distance the golden cliffs raised their mighty barrier faces far into the starlit heavens the precious metals and scintillating jewels that composed them sparkling in the brilliant light of mars s two gorgeous moons at my back was the forest pruned and trimmed like the sward to parklike symmetry by the browsing of the ghoulish plant men before me lay the lost sea of korus while farther on i caught the shimmering ribbon of iss the river of mystery where it wound out from beneath the golden cliffs to empty into korus to which for countless ages had been borne the deluded and unhappy martians of the outer world upon the voluntary pilgrimage to this false heaven the plant men with their blood sucking hands and the monstrous white apes that make dor hideous by day were hidden in their lairs for the night there was no longer a holy thern upon the balcony in the golden cliffs above the iss to summon them with weird cry to the victims floating down to their maws upon the cold broad bosom of ancient iss the navies of helium and the first born had cleared the fortresses and the temples of the therns when they had refused to surrender and accept the new order of things that had swept their false religion from long suffering mars in a few isolated countries they still retained their age old power but matai shang their hekkador father of therns had been driven from his temple strenuous had been our endeavors to capture him but with a few of the faithful he had escaped and was in hiding where we knew not as i came cautiously to the edge of the low cliff overlooking the lost sea of korus i saw thurid pushing out upon the bosom of the shimmering water in a small skiff one of those strangely wrought craft of unthinkable age which the holy therns with their organization of priests and lesser therns were wont to distribute along the banks of the iss that the long journey of their victims might be facilitated drawn up on the beach below me were a score of similar boats each with its long pole at one end of which was a pike at the other a paddle thurid was hugging the shore and as he passed out of sight round a near by promontory i shoved one of the boats into the water and calling woola into it pushed out from shore the pursuit of thurid carried me along the edge of the sea toward the mouth of the iss the farther moon lay close to the horizon casting a dense shadow beneath the cliffs that fringed the water thuria the nearer moon had set nor would it rise again for near four hours so that i was ensured concealing darkness for that length of time at least on and on went the black warrior now he was opposite the mouth of the iss without an instant s hesitation he turned up the grim river paddling hard against the strong current after him came woola and i closer now for the man was too intent upon forcing his craft up the river to have any eyes for what might be transpiring behind him he hugged the shore where the current was less strong presently he came to the dark cavernous portal in the face of the golden cliffs through which the river poured on into the stygian darkness beyond he urged his craft it seemed hopeless to attempt to follow him here where i could not see my hand before my face and i was almost on the point of giving up the pursuit and drifting back to the mouth of the river there to await his return when a sudden bend showed a faint luminosity ahead my quarry was plainly visible again and in the increasing light from the phosphorescent rock that lay embedded in great patches in the roughly arched roof of the cavern i had no difficulty in following him it

shall see a world very unlike that in which we are now moving midway from the birth of our lord to the present era the great struggle between the new and old had not subsided and the great european world of civilized nations had not yet settled into their homes and characters christianity had been accepted by the roman emperor six hundred years previously but the empire was by that time too weak and corrupt to be renewed even by the fresh spirit infused into it and from the th century onward it had been breaking up under the force of the fierce currents of nations that rushed from the north east of europe the greek half of the empire prolonged its existence in the levant but the latin or western portion became a wreck before the th century was far advanced however each conquering tribe that poured into the southern dominions had been already so far impressed with the wisdom and dignity of rome and the holiness of her religion that they paused in their violence and gradually allowed themselves to be taught by her doctrine tamed by her manners and governed by her laws the patriarch of rome papa or father was acknowledged by them as by the subjects of rome of old they accepted the clergy who had already formed dioceses and parishes and though much of horrible savagery remained to be subdued in the general mass yet there was a gradual work of amelioration in progress this was especially the case with the franks who had overspread the northern half of gaul their first race of kings had become christians simultaneously with their conquest and though these soon dwindled away between crime and luxury there had grown up under them a brave and ambitious family whose earlier members were among the most distinguished persons in history charles martel turned back the saracens at tours and saved europe from mahometanism and his grandson charles the great rescued the pope from the lombards and received from him in return the crown of a new empire of the west the holy roman empire which was supposed to be the great temporal power as the pope or patriarch was deemed the head of all bishops so the emperor was to be deemed the head of all kings of the west from the danube and baltic to the atlantic ocean the whole country that had once been held by rome and then had been wrested from her by the various german or teutonic races the island of great britain was a sort of exception to the general rule like gaul it had once been wholly keltic but it had not been as entirely subdued by the romans and the overflow of teutons came very early thither and while they were yet so thoroughly pagan that the old keltic church failed to convert them and the mission of st augustine was necessary from rome a little later when charles the great formed his empire of franks germans saxons and gauls egbert gathered in like manner the various petty kingdoms of the angles and saxons under the one dominant realm of wessex and thus became a sort of island emperor it seems however to be a rule that nations and families recently emerged from barbarism soon fade and decay under the influence of high civilization and just as the first race of frankish kings had withered away on the throne so the line of charles the great though not inactive became less powerful and judicious grew feeble in the very next generation and were little able to hold together the multitude of nations that had formed the empire soon the kingdom of france split away from the empire and while a fresh and more able emperor became the head of the west the descendants of the great charles still struggled on at their royal cities of laon and soissons with the terrible difficulties brought upon them by restless subjects and by the last and most vigorous swarm of all the teutonic invaders the wild rugged hills and coasts of scandinavia with their keen climate long nights and many gulfs and bays had contributed to nurse the teuton race in a vigor and perfection scarcely found elsewhere or not at least since the more southern races had yielded to the enervating influences of their settled life some of these had indeed been tamed but more had been degraded the english were degenerating into clownishness the franks into effeminacy and though christianity continually raised up most brilliant lights now on the throne now in the cathedral now in the cloister yet the mass of the people lay sluggish dull inert selfish and half savage they were in this state when the norseman and the dane fitted out their long ships and burst upon their coasts by a peculiar law common once to all the teuton nations though by that time altered in the southern ones the land of a family was not divided among its members but all possessed an equal right in it and thus as it was seldom adequate to maintain them all the more enterprising used their right in it only to fell trees enough to build a ship and to demand corn enough to victual their crew which was formed of other young men whose family inheritance could not furnish more than a sword or spear kings and princes of whom there were many were exactly in the same position as their subjects and they too were wont to seek their fortunes upon the high seas fleets coalesced under the command of some chieftain of birth or note and the vikings or pirates sailed fearlessly forth to plunder the tempting regions to the south of them fierce worshippers were they of the old gods odin frey thor of the third above all others and their lengthy nights had led to their working up those myths that had always been common to the whole

lancelot for friend the idylls with all their beauties are full of a victorian respectability and love of talking with vivien about what is not so respectable one wishes at times that the morte d arthur had remained a lonely and flawless fragment as noble as homer as polished as sophocles but then we must have missed with many other admirable things the last battle in the west people who come after us will be more impressed than we are by the laureate s versatility he has touched so many strings from will waterproof s monologue so far above praed to the agony of rizpah the invincible energy of ulysses the languor and the fairy music of the lotus eaters the grace as of a greek epigram which inspires the lines to catullus and to virgil he is with milton for learning with keats for magic and vision with virgil for graceful recasting of ancient golden lines and even in the latest volume of his long life we may tell from the straw as homer says what the grain has been there are many who make it a kind of religion to regard mr browning as the greatest of living english poets for him too one is thankful as for a veritable great poet but can we believe that impartial posterity will rate him with the laureate or that so large a proportion of his work will endure the charm of an enigma now attracts students who feel proud of being able to understand what others find obscure but this attraction must inevitably become a stumbling block why mr browning is obscure is a long question probably the answer is that he often could not help himself his darkest poems may be made out by a person of average intelligence who will read them as hard as for example he would find it necessary to read the logic of hegel there is a story of two clever girls who set out to peruse sordello and corresponded with each other about their progress somebody is dead in sordello one of them wrote to her friend i don t quite know who it is but it must make things a little clearer in the long run alas a copious use of the guillotine would scarcely clear the stage of sordello it is hardly to be hoped that sordello or red cotton night cap country or fifine will continue to be struggled with by posterity but the mass of men and women that unexampled gallery of portraits of the inmost hearts and secret minds of priests prigs princes girls lovers poets painters must survive immortally while civilization and literature last while men care to know what is in men no perversity of humour no voluntary or involuntary harshness of style can destroy the merit of these poems which have nothing like them in the letters of the past and must remain without successful imitators in the future they will last all the better for a certain manliness of religious faith something sturdy and assured not moved by winds of doctrine not paltering with doubts which is certainly one of mr browning s attractions in this fickle and shifting generation he cannot be forgotten while as he says a sunset touch a chorus ending of euripides remind men that they are creatures of immortality and move a thousand hopes and fears if one were to write out of mere personal preference and praise most that which best fits one s private moods i suppose i should place mr matthew arnold at the head of contemporary english poets reason and reflection discussion and critical judgment tell one that he is not quite there mr arnold had not the many melodies of the laureate nor his versatile mastery nor his magic nor his copiousness he had not the microscopic glance of mr browning nor his rude grasp of facts which

on the deck of a savannah steam ship which was lying at a dock in the east river new york i was waiting for young rectus and had already waited some time which surprised me because rectus was as a general thing a very prompt fellow who seldom kept people waiting but it was probably impossible for him to regulate his own movements this time for his father and mother were coming with him to see him off i had no one there to see me off but i did not care for that i was sixteen years old and felt quite like a man whereas rectus was only fourteen and couldn t possibly feel like a man unless his

me sail away in a steam ship they took a good leave of me though before i left home i shall never forget how i first became acquainted with rectus about a couple of years before he was a new boy in the academy at willisville one saturday a lot of us went down to the river to swim our favorite place was near an old wharf which ran out into deep water and a fellow could take a good dive there when the tide was high there were some of the smaller boys along that day but they didn t dive any and if they even swam it was in shallow water near the shore by the side of the wharf but i think most of them spent their time wading about i was a good swimmer and could dive very well i was learning to swim under water but had not done very much in that line at the time i speak of we were nearly ready to come out when i took a dive from a post on the end of the wharf and then turned under water to swim in shore i intended to try to keep under until i got into water shallow enough for me to touch bottom and walk ashore after half a dozen strokes i felt for the bottom and my feet touched it then i raised my head but i didn t raise it out of the water it struck something hard in an instant i knew what had happened there was a big mud scow lying by the side of the wharf and i had got under that it was a great flat thing ever so long and very wide i knew i must get from under it as quickly as i could indeed i could hardly hold my breath now i waded along with my head bent down but i didn t reach the side of it then i turned the other way but my hands which i held up still touched nothing but the hard slimy bottom of the scow i must have been wading up and down the length of the thing i was bewildered i couldn t think which way to turn i could only think of one thing i would be drowned in less than a minute scott would be head of the class my mother and little helen but i can t tell what my thoughts were then they were dreadful but just as i was thinking of helen and mother i saw through the water some white things not far from me i knew by their looks that they were a boy s legs i staggered toward them and in a moment my hands went out of water just at the side of the scow i stood up and my head with half my body came up into the air what a breath i drew but i felt so weak and shaky that i had to take hold of the side of the scow and stand there for a while before i waded ashore the boy who was standing by me was rectus he did not have that name then and i didn t know him it must be pretty hard to stay under water so long he said hard i answered as soon as i could get my breath i should think so why i came near being drowned is that so said he i didn t know that i saw you go down and have been watching for you to come up but i didn t expect you to come from under the scow how glad i was that he had been standing there watching for me to come up if he had not been there or if his legs had been green or the color of water i believe i should have drowned i always liked the boy after that though of course there was no particular reason for it he was a boarder his parents lived in new york samuel colbert was his real name and the title of rectus he obtained at school by being so good he scarcely ever did anything wrong which was rather surprising to the rest of us because he was not sickly or anything of that kind after a while we got into the way of calling him rectus and as he didn t seem to mind it the name stuck to him the boys generally liked him and he got on quite well in the school in every way except in his studies he was not a smart boy and did not pretend to be i went right through the academy from the lowest to the highest class and when i left the professor as we called our principal said that i was ready to go to college and urged me very much to do so but i was not in any hurry and my parents agreed with me that after four years of school life i had better wait a while before beginning a new course all this disturbed the professor very much but he insisted on my keeping up my studies so as not to get rusty and he came up to our house very often for the purpose of seeing what i was doing in the study line and how i was doing it i thought over things a good deal for myself and a few months after i left the academy i made up my mind to travel a little i talked about it at home and it was generally thought to be a good idea although my sister was in favor of it only in case i took her with me otherwise she opposed it but there were a great many reasons why i could not take her she was only eleven i had some money of my own which i thought i would rather spend in travel than in any other way and as it was not a large sum and as my father could not afford to add anything to it my journey could not be very extensive indeed i only contemplated going to florida and perhaps a few other southern states and then if it could be done a visit to some of the west india islands and as it was

hearts were not in it and as soon as opportunity offered they abandoned engraving john went into journalism became editorially connected with prominent newspapers and had won a foremost place in his chosen profession when he was cut off by death at a comparatively early age illustration the holt mr stockton s home near convent n j frank chose literature he had while in the engraving business written a number of fairy tales some of which had been published in juvenile magazines also a few short stories and quite an ambitious long story which was published in a prominent magazine he was then sufficiently well known as a writer to obtain without difficulty a place on the staff of hearth and home a weekly new york paper owned by orange judd and conducted by edward eggleston mrs mary mapes dodge had charge of the juvenile department and frank went on the paper as her assistant not long after scribner s monthly was started by charles scribner the elder in conjunction with roswell smith and j g holland later mr smith and his associates formed the century company and with this company mr stockton was connected for many years first on the century magazine which succeeded scribner s monthly and afterward on st nicholas as assistant to mrs mary mapes dodge and still later when he decided to give up editorial work as a constant contributor after a few years he resigned his position in the company with which he had been so pleasantly associated in order to devote himself exclusively to his own work by this time he had written and published enough to feel justified in taking what seemed to his friends a bold and even rash step because so few writers then lived solely by the pen he was never very strong physically he felt himself unable to do his editorial work and at the same time write out the fancies and stories with which his mind was full this venture proved to be the wisest thing for him and from that time his life was in great part in his books and he gave to the world the novels and stories which bear his name i have mentioned his fairy stories having been a great lover of fairy lore when a child he naturally fell into this form of story writing as soon as he was old enough to put a story together he invented a goodly number and among them the ting a ling stories which were read aloud in a boys literary circle and meeting their hearty approval were subsequently published in the riverside magazine a handsome and popular juvenile of that period and much later were issued by hurd houghton in a very pretty volume in regard to these he wrote long afterward as follows i was very young when i determined to write some fairy tales because my mind was full of them i set to work and in course of time produced several which were printed these were constructed according to my own ideas i caused the fanciful creatures who inhabited the world of fairy land to act as far as possible for them to do so as if they were inhabitants of the real world i did not dispense with monsters and enchanters or talking beasts and birds but i obliged these creatures to infuse into their extraordinary actions a certain leaven of common sense it was about this time while very young that he and his brother became ambitious to write stories poems and essays for the world at large they sent their effusions to various periodicals with the result common to ambitious youths all were returned they decided at last that editors did not know a good thing when they saw it and hit upon a brilliant scheme to prove their own judgment one of them selected an extract from paradise regained as being not so well known as paradise lost and sent it to an editor with the boy s own name appended expecting to have it returned with some of the usual disparaging remarks which they would greatly enjoy but they were disappointed the editor printed it in his paper thereby proving that he did know a good thing if he did not know his milton mr stockton was fond of telling this story and it may have given rise to a report extensively circulated that he tried to gain admittance to periodicals for many years before he succeeded this is not true some rebuffs he had of course some with things which afterward proved great successes but not as great a number as falls to the lot of most beginners the ting a ling tales proved so popular that mr stockton followed them at intervals with long and short stories for the young which appeared in various juvenile publications and were afterward published in book form roundabout rambles tales out of school a jolly fellowship personally conducted the story of viteau the floating prince and others some years later after he had begun to write for older readers he wrote a series of stories for st nicholas ostensibly for children but really intended for adults children liked the stories but the deeper meaning underlying them all was beyond the grasp of a child s mind these stories mr stockton took very great pleasure in writing and always regarded them as some of his best work and was gratified when his critics wrote of them in that way they have become famous and have been translated into several languages notably old pipes and the dryad the bee man of orne and the griffin and the minor canon this last story was suggested by chester cathedral and he wrote it in that venerable city the several tales were finally collected into a volume under the title the bee man of orne and other stories which is included in the complete edition of his novels and stories during the whole of his literary career mr stockton was an occasional contributor of short stories and essays to the youth s companion mr stockton considered his career as an editor of great ad

little boys asked winterbourne i don t know i m an american boy said the child i see you are one of the best laughed winterbourne are you an american man pursued this vivacious infant and then on winterbourne s affirmative reply american men are the best he declared his companion thanked him for the compliment and the child who had now got astride of his alpenstock stood looking about him while he attacked a second lump of sugar winterbourne wondered if he himself had been like this in his infancy for he had been brought to europe at about this age here comes my sister cried the child in a moment she s an american girl winterbourne looked along the path and saw a beautiful young lady advancing american girls are the best girls he said cheerfully to his young companion my sister ain t the best the child declared she s always blowing at me i imagine that is your fault not hers said winterbourne the young lady meanwhile had drawn near she was dressed in white muslin with a hundred frills and flounces and knots of pale colored ribbon she was bareheaded but she balanced in her hand a large parasol with a deep border of embroidery and she was strikingly admirably pretty how pretty they are thought winterbourne straightening himself in his seat as if he were prepared to rise the young lady paused in front of his bench near the parapet of the garden which overlooked the lake the little boy had now converted his alpenstock into a vaulting pole by the aid of which he was springing about in the gravel and kicking it up not a little randolph said the young lady what are you doing i m going up the alps replied randolph this is the way and he gave another little jump scattering the pebbles about winterbourne s ears that s the way they come down said winterbourne he s an american man cried randolph in his little hard voice the young lady gave no heed to this announcement but looked straight at her brother well i guess you had better be quiet she simply observed it seemed to winterbourne that he had been in a manner presented he got up and stepped slowly toward the young girl throwing away his cigarette this little boy and i have made acquaintance he said with great civility in geneva as he had been perfectly aware a young man was not at liberty to speak to a young unmarried lady except under certain rarely occurring conditions but here at vevey what conditions could be better than these a pretty american girl coming and standing in front of you in a garden this pretty american girl however on hearing winterbourne s observation simply glanced at him she then turned her head and looked over the parapet at the lake and the opposite mountains he wondered whether he had gone too far but he decided that he must advance farther rather than retreat while he was thinking of something else to say the young lady turned to the little boy again i should like to know where you got that pole she said i bought it responded randolph you don t mean to say you re going to take it to italy yes i am going to take it to italy the child declared the young girl glanced over the front of her dress and smoothed out a knot or two of ribbon then she rested her eyes upon the prospect again well i guess you had better leave it somewhere she said after a moment are you going to italy winterbourne inquired in a tone of great respect the young lady glanced at him again yes sir she replied and she said nothing more are you a going over the simplon winterbourne pursued a little embarrassed i don t know she said i suppose it s some mountain randolph what mountain are we going over going where the child demanded to italy winterbourne explained i don t know said randolph i don t want to go to italy i want to go to america oh italy is a beautiful place rejoined the young man can you get candy there randolph loudly inquired i hope not said his sister i guess you have had enough candy and mother thinks so too i haven t had any for ever so long for a hundred weeks cried the boy still jumping about the young lady inspected her flounces and smoothed her ribbons again and winterbourne presently risked an observation upon the beauty of the view he was ceasing to be embarrassed for he had begun to perceive that she was not in the least embarrassed herself there had not been the slightest alteration in her charming complexion she was evidently neither offended nor flattered if she looked another way when he spoke to her and seemed not particularly to hear him this was simply her habit her manner yet as he talked a little more and pointed out some of the objects of interest in the view with which she appeared quite unacquainted she gradually gave him more of the benefit of her glance and then he saw that this glance was perfectly direct and unshrinking it was not however what would have been called an immodest glance for the young girl s eyes were singularly honest and fresh they were wonderfully pretty eyes and indeed winterbourne had not seen for a long time anything prettier than his fair countrywoman s various features her complexion her nose her ears her teeth he had a great relish for feminine beauty he was addicted to observing and analyzing it and as regards this young lady s face he made several observations it was not at all insipid but it was not exactly expressive and though it was eminently delicate winterbourne mentally accused it

others thought we might have had a quiet chat first will you stand by the girls for a moment lutchester while i have a look round he added he hobbled away one of the thousands who were thronging the streets and public places of london brave simple minded young men all of them with tangled recollections in their brains of blood and fire and hell and a game leg or a lost arm to remind them that the whole thing was not a nightmare he looked a little disconsolately around and was on the point of rejoining the others when the friend for whom he was searching came hurriedly through the turnstile doors sandy old chap holderness exclaimed with an air of relief here you are at last cheero dick was the light hearted reply fearfully sorry i m late but listen just listen for one moment the newcomer

his tone dick he continued gripping his friend s arm tightly i m late i know but i ve great news i ve motored straight up from salisbury plain i ve done it i swear to you dick i ve done it done what

be in the japanese embassy at washington the two men shook hands i was interested the japanese said slowly in your conversation just now about that notice your young friend was telling you news very loudly indeed it seemed to me which you would not like known across the north sea am i not right in a sense you are of course holderness admitted but here at henry s why the place is like a club where are the enemies ears to come from i should like to know where we least expect to find them as a rule was the grave reply quite right lutchester who had just rejoined them agreed they still say you

was exactly thirty five years and a half he was a short compact figure and a little inclined to a localised embonpoint his face was not unpleasing the features fine but a trifle too pointed about the nose to be classically perfect the corners of his sensitive mouth were depressed his eyes were ruddy brown and troubled and the left one was round with more of wonder in it than its fellow his complexion was dull and yellowish that as i have explained on account of those civil disturbances he was in the technical sense of the word clean shaved with a small sallow patch under the right ear and a cut on the chin his brow had the little puckerings of a thoroughly discontented man little wrinklings and lumps particularly over his right eye and he sat with his hands in his pockets a little askew on the stile and swung one leg hole he repeated presently he broke into a quavering song ro o o tten be e astly silly hole his voice thickened with rage and the rest of his discourse was marred by an unfortunate choice of epithets he was dressed in a shabby black morning coat and vest the braid that bound these garments was a little loose in places his collar was chosen from stock and with projecting corners technically a wing poke that and his tie which was new and loose and rich in colouring had been selected to encourage and stimulate customers for he dealt in gentlemen s outfitting his golf cap which was also from stock and aslant over his eye gave his misery a desperate touch he wore brown leather boots because he hated the smell of blacking perhaps after all it was not simply indigestion that troubled him behind the superficialities of mr polly s being moved a larger and vaguer distress the elementary education he had acquired had left him with the impression that arithmetic was a fluky science and best avoided in practical affairs but even the absence of book keeping and a total inability to distinguish between capital and interest could not blind him for ever to the fact that the little shop in the high street was not paying an absence of returns a constriction of credit a depleted till the most valiant resolves to keep smiling could not prevail for ever against these insistent phenomena one might bustle about in the morning before dinner and in the afternoon after tea and forget that huge dark cloud of insolvency that gathered and spread in the background but it was part of the desolation of these afternoon periods these grey spaces of time after meals when all one s courage had descended to the unseen battles of the pit that life seemed stripped to the bone and one saw with a hopeless clearness let me tell the history of mr polly from the cradle to these present difficulties first the infant mewling and puking in its nurse s arms there had been a time when two people had thought mr polly the most wonderful and adorable thing in the world had kissed his toe nails saying myum myum and marvelled at the exquisite softness and delicacy of his hair had called to one another to remark the peculiar distinction with which he bubbled had disputed whether the sound he had made was just da da or truly and intentionally dadda had washed him in the utmost detail and wrapped him up in soft warm blankets and smothered him with kisses a regal time that was and four and thirty years ago and a merciful forgetfulness barred mr polly from ever bringing its careless luxury its autocratic demands and instant obedience into contrast with his present condition of life these two people had worshipped him from the crown of his head to the soles of his exquisite feet and also they had fed him rather unwisely for no one had ever troubled to teach his mother anything about the mysteries of a child s upbringing though of course the monthly nurse and her charwoman gave some valuable hints and by his fifth birthday the perfect rhythms of his nice new interior were already darkened with perplexity his mother died when he was seven he began only to have distinctive memories of himself in the time when his education had already begun i remember seeing a picture of education in some place i think it was education but quite conceivably it represented the empire teaching her sons and i have a strong impression that it was a wall painting upon some public building in manchester or birmingham or glasgow but very possibly i am mistaken about that it represented a glorious woman with a wise and fearless face stooping over her children and pointing them to far horizons the sky displayed the pearly warmth of a summer dawn and all the painting was marvellously bright as if with the youth and hope of the delicately beautiful children in the foreground she was telling them one felt of the great prospect of life that opened before them of the spectacle of the world the splendours of sea and mountain they might travel and see the joys of skill they might acquire of effort and the pride of effort and the devotions and nobilities it was theirs to achieve perhaps even she whispered of the warm triumphant mystery of love that comes at last to those who have patience and unblemished hearts she was reminding them of their great heritage as english children rulers of more than one fifth of mankind of the obligation to do and be the best that such a pride of empire entails of their essential nobility and knighthood and the restraints and the charities and the disciplined strength that is becoming in knights and rulers the education of mr polly did not follow this picture very closely he went for some time to a national school which was run on severely economical lines to keep down the rates by a largely untrained staff he was set sums to do that he did not understand and that no one made him understand he

flashed for an instant and he was on the point of making a bitter reply to his relative but then his mouth closed suddenly and he turned away in silence he drew off his slippers donned his big boots and put on his overcoat and his winter cap then he pulled on his gloves slung a game bag over his shoulder and reached for a gun that stood behind a door wot you takin thet fer demanded josiah graham with his eyes on the gun didn t i tell you to look fer a job that s what i m going to do was the reply but if i come across any game on the way i want the chance to bring it down humph i know how boys are rather loaf around the woods than work any time uncle si if you say another word began the youth and then he stopped short turned on his heel and walked from the cabin closing the door none too gently behind him it was certainly a trying situation and as he stepped out into the snow andy felt as if he never wanted to go back and never wanted to see his uncle si again it s his laziness nothing else murmured the boy to himself as he trudged off he s as able to work as i am he always was lazy father said so oh dear i wish he had never come to pine run andy was a youth of seventeen of medium height but with well developed chest and muscles his face was a round one and usually good to look at although at present it was drawn down because of what had just occurred the boy was an orphan the son of a man who in years gone by had bought and sold lumber throughout the northern section of maine his mother had been taken away when he was a small lad and then he and his father had left town and come to live in the big cabin from which andy was now trudging so rapidly an old colored woman had come along to do the cooking and other household work a log jam on the river had caused mr graham s death two years before this tale opens and for a short time andy had been left utterly alone there being no near neighbors and no relatives to take care of the orphan true he had been offered a home by a lumber dealer of bangor but the man was such a harsh fellow that andy shrank from going with him then one day much to everybody s surprise josiah graham appeared on the scene and announced his intention to settle down and live with his nephew josiah was an older half brother to andy s father and the boy had often heard of him as a shiftless lazy ne er do well who drifted from one town to another seldom keeping a job longer than two or three weeks or a month he did not drink but he loved to smoke and to tell stories of what he had done or was going to do i m a goin to take andy in hand an make a man of him he declared shortly after his arrival a young feller like him needs a guardeen and then he had his trunk carted to the cabin and without asking andy s permission proceeded to settle down and make himself comfortable at first it looked as if matters might go along smoothly enough for josiah graham managed to obtain a position as time keeper at one of the lumber camps where andy was employed as a chopper but soon the man s laziness manifested itself and when he did not do his work properly he was discharged it was the boss s fault twasn t mine he told andy but the youth knew better then he got into a quarrel with the negro woman who did the housework and told her to go away twill be one less to feed he said to his nephew we can do our own work but he did not do a stroke extra and it fell to andy s share to sweep and wash dishes and make his own bed uncle si wanted him to make the other bed too but he refused if you want it made you can make it yourself declared andy with spirit you are not working at the camp while i am this led to a lively quarrel after that josiah graham did make up the bed a few times but usually when he crawled into it at night it was in the same mussed up condition as when he had crawled out in the morning another quarrel came over the question of money the uncle wanted andy to hand over all his earnings but this the lad refused to do josiah graham had already gotten possession of the fifteen hundred dollars left by andy s father but this was lost in a wildcat speculation in lumber for which the old man was morally if not legally responsible the youth felt that he must be cautious or his uncle might make him penniless i ll pay the bills and give you a dollar a week he told josiah graham that will buy those tablets you take for your dyspepsia you had better give up smoking smoking is good for the dyspepsy was the reply you give me the money an i ll pay the bills and then when andy still refused the uncle waited until pay day and went to the lumber camp and collected his nephew s wages this brought on more trouble and because of this andy lost his position it was midwinter and to get another job was by no means easy the youth tramped from place to place but without success the money in the hands of josiah graham was running low and he was constantly nagging andy to go and do something he was perfectly able to look for work himself but was too indolent to make the effort he preferred to sit in front of the blazing fire and give advice once or twice a week he would shuffle off to the village two miles away to sit behind the pot stove in the general store and listen to the news the laziest man in the whole district declared the storekeeper it s a pity he showed up to bother andy graham i think the boy could have done better without him and this verdict was shared by many but nobody dared to tell josiah graham for fear of provoking a quarrel with the man as mentioned before

her master died a sickly smile and he said louise i have sold you god is my judge may i never see such a look of despairing desolate anguish as that which the woman cast on her master griping her breast with her little hands as if he had stabbed her standing in silence a space as fixed as the indian woman carved out of wood on the pilot house of the old pocahontas then with a gurgling moan like the sound in the throat of the dying came back her voice that rising fluttered through wild incoherence into a terrible shriek that stopped my heart while she answered sold me sold me sold and you promised to give me my freedom promised me for the sake of our little boy in saint louis what will you say to our boy when he cries for me there in saint louis what will you say to our god ah you have been joking i see it no god god he shall hear it and all of the angels in heaven even the devils in hell and none will believe when they hear it sold me her voice died away with a wail and in silence down she sank on the deck and covered her face with her fingers iv in his story a moment the pilot paused while we listened to the salute of a boat that rounding the point of an island flamed toward us with fires that seemed to burn from the waters stately and vast and swift and borne on the heart of the current then with the mighty voice of a giant challenged to battle rose the responsive whistle and all the echoes of island swamp land glade and brake replied with a myriad clamor like wild birds that are suddenly startled from slumber at midnight then were at peace once more and we heard the harsh cries of the peacocks perched on a tree by a cabin door where the white headed settler s white headed children stood to look at the boat as it passed them passed them so near that we heard their happy talk and their laughter softly the sunset had faded and now on the eastern horizon hung like a tear in the sky the beautiful star of the evening v still with his back to us standing the pilot went on with his story all of us flocked round the woman the children cried and their mothers hugged them tight to their breasts but the gambler said to the captain put me off there at the town that lies round the bend of the river here you rise at once and be ready now to go with me roughly he seized the woman s arm and strove to uplift her she she seemed not to heed him but rose like one that is dreaming slid from his grasp and fleetly mounted the steps of the gangway up to the hurricane deck in silence without lamentation straight to the stern of the boat where the wheel was she ran and the people followed her fast till she turned and stood at bay for a moment looking them in the face and in the face of the gambler not one to save her not one of all the compassionate people not one to save her of all the pitying angels in heaven not one bolt of god to strike him dead there before her wildly she waved him back we waiting in silence and horror over the swarthy face of the gambler a pallor of passion passed like a gleam of lightning over the west in the night time white she stood and mute till he put forth his hand to secure her then she turned and leaped in mid air fluttered a moment down then whirling fell like a broken winged bird from a tree top down on the cruel wheel that caught her and hurled her and crushed her and in the foaming water plunged her and hid her forever vi still with his back to us all the pilot stood but we heard him swallowing hard as he pulled the bell rope for stopping then turning this is the place where it happened brokenly whispered the pilot somehow i never like to go by here alone in the night time darkly the mississippi flowed by the town that lay in the starlight cheerful with lamps below we could hear them

later remonstrated his brother sam if we don t they ll grow up the wildest bunch ever known a number of cries of alarm and protest mingled with fierce cheering had reached the house from the garden just beyond the broad veranda as the three rover brothers hurried through the hallway and outside the yelling and cheering were renewed then just as tom rover stepped out on the veranda there was a sudden swish and a stream of water from a garden hose caught him directly in the left ear hi hi stop that cried tom rover doing his best to dodge the stream of water which suddenly seemed to play all over the piazza what do you mean by wetting me this way it wasn t my fault dad came from a boy standing on the lawn both hands clutching a rubber hose held also by another boy of about the same age it was fred who turned the hose that way nothing of the sort it was randy twisted it that way trying to get it away from me cried fred rover and he isn t going to do it and thereupon ensued a struggle between the two boys which caused the stream of water to fly over the garden first in one direction and then another in the meanwhile not far away another stream of water was issuing from a hose held by two other lads this as well as the water from hose number one had been directed towards the back of the garden where an elderly white man and an equally elderly colored man were trying to shelter themselves behind a low hedge to keep from becoming drenched fo de lan s sake massa dick won t you make dem boys stop cried out the old colored man when he caught sight of dick rover hurrying out on the lawn dem boys is jest nacherly tryin to drown old aleck pop dat s what dey is they didn t have no call to touch them hoses came from the elderly white man i tol em they mustn t muss with the water but they won t mind nohow and thus speaking old jack ness held up his hands in comic despair why we didn t know you were behind the hedge came from one of the boys holding the second hose we thought you were both down at the barn you can t make believe like that andy rover returned the old man of all work shaking his head vigorously you knowed i was goin to trim up this hedge a bit and that aleck was goin to help me you boys let up with this nonsense came sternly from tom rover he turned to face one of his twins randy i ought to give you a thrashing for wetting me like this don t fred get half

of all work i think it s a shame for you boys to drench old ness and aleck was sam rover s sober comment both of them might catch cold or get rheumatism we didn t start to do anything like that dad answered fred rover we were going to have a little fight between ourselves playing rival firemen we aimed the water at the hedge and we didn t see ness and aleck until they let out a yell but i saw two of you playing the water in that direction cried dick rover you were one of them jack oh well dad what was the harm after they were all wet pleaded his son they d have to change their clothing anyway that s just it added andy rover quickly with his eyes twinkling from merriment a little more water won t hurt a person when he s already soaked it s just like spoiling a rotten egg it can t be

these pranks around the farm have got to stop you ll have your grandfather and uncle randolph and aunt martha all upset not to say anything about your sisters and your mothers it s a fortunate thing that they went down to the town to do some shopping otherwise i think all of you would be in for quite some punishment oh then you re not going to punish us are you broke in randy rover quickly that s

and heidelburg to throw away his science gratuitously on the first greaser he meets it will cost eh how much said the mexican eagerly well i should say it would take about a hundred dollars and expenses to to find silver in that ore but once you ve got it there you re all right for tons of it you shall have it said the now excited mexican you shall have it of us the four you shall come to our camp and shall melt it and show the silver and enough come and in his feverishness he clutched the hand of his companion as if to lead him forth at once what are you going to do with your mule

was uppermost i will come back to thee little one to morrow a rich man meanwhile wait thou here patient one adios thou smallest of mules adios and seizing the stranger s hand he clambered up the rocky ledge until they reached the summit then the stranger turned and gave one sweep of his malevolent eye over the valley wherefore in after years when their story was related with the devotion of true catholic pioneers they named the mountain la canada de la visitacion del diablo the gulch of the visitation of the devil the same being now the boundary lines of one of the famous mexican land grants

when they had ridden a mile along the ridge they began to descend again toward the valley vegetation now sparingly bordered the trail clumps of chemisal an occasional manzanita bush and one or two dwarfed buckeyes rooted their way between the interstices of the black gray rock now and then in crossing some dry gully worn by the overflow of winter torrents from above the grayish rock gloom was relieved by dull red and brown masses of color and almost every overhanging rock bore the mark of a miner s pick presently as they rounded the curving flank of the mountain from a rocky bench below them a thin ghost like stream of smoke seemed to be steadily drawn by invisible hands into the invisible ether it is the camp said concho gleefully i will myself forward to prepare them for the stranger and before his companion could detain him he had disappeared at a sharp canter around the curve of the trail left to himself the stranger took a more leisurely pace which left him ample time for reflection scamp as he was there was something in the simple credulity of poor concho that made him uneasy not that his moral consciousness was touched but he feared that concho s companions might knowing concho s simplicity instantly suspect him of trading upon it he rode on in a deep study was he reviewing his past life a vagabond by birth and education a swindler by profession an outcast by reputation without absolutely turning his back upon respectability he had trembled on the perilous edge of criminality ever since his boyhood he did not scruple to cheat these mexicans they were a degraded race and for a moment he felt almost an accredited agent of progress and civilization we never really understand the meaning of enlightenment until we begin to use it aggressively a few paces further on four figures appeared in the now gathering darkness of the trail the stranger quickly recognized the beaming smile of concho foremost of the party a quick glance at the faces of the others satisfied him that while they lacked concho s good humor they certainly did not surpass him in intellect pedro was a stout vaquero manuel was a slim half breed and ex convert of the mission of san carmel and miguel a recent butcher of monterey under the benign influences of concho that suspicion with which the ignorant regard strangers died away and the whole party escorted the stranger who had given his name as mr joseph wiles to their camp fire so anxious were they to begin their experiments that even the instincts of hospitality were forgotten and it was not until mr wiles now known as don jose sharply reminded them that he wanted some grub that they came to their senses when the frugal meal of tortillas frijoles salt pork and chocolate was over an oven was built of the dark red rock brought from the ledge before them and an earthenware jar glazed by some peculiar local process tightly fitted over it and packed with clay and sods a fire was speedily built of pine boughs continually brought from a wooded ravine below and in a few moments the furnace was in full blast mr wiles did not participate in these active preparations except to give occasional directions between his teeth which were contemplatively fixed over a clay pipe as he lay comfortably on his back on the ground whatever enjoyment the rascal may have had in their useless labors he did not show it but it

and there was ethel baird whom also you must remember a warm saint i said that is she holy as love and sweeter just a woman made for love and yet how shall i say drenched through with holiness as your own air here is with the perfume of flowers well they married they played a hand with the gods and they won they gloriously won i broke in carquinez looked at me pityingly and his voice was like a funeral bell they lost they supremely colossally lost but the world believes otherwise i ventured coldly the world conjectures the world sees only the face of things but i know has it ever entered your mind to wonder why she took the veil buried herself in that dolorous convent of the living dead because she loved him so and when he died speech was frozen on my lips by carquinez s sneer a pat answer he said machine made like a piece of cotton drill the world s judgment and much the world knows about it like you she fled from life she was beaten she flung out the white flag of fatigue and no beleaguered city ever flew that flag in such bitterness and tears now i shall tell you the whole tale and you must believe me for i know they had pondered the problem of satiety they loved love they knew to the uttermost farthing the value of love they loved him so well that they were fain to keep him always warm and a thrill in their hearts they welcomed his coming they feared to have him depart love was desire they held a delicious pain he was ever seeking easement and when he found that for which he sought he died love denied was love alive love granted was love deceased do you follow me they saw it was not the way of life to be hungry for what it has to eat and still be hungry man has never accomplished that feat the problem of satiety that is it to have and to keep the sharp famine edge of appetite at the groaning board this was their problem for they loved love often did they discuss it with all love s sweet ardours brimming in their eyes his ruddy blood spraying their cheeks his voice playing in and out with their voices now hiding as a tremolo in their throats and again shading a tone with that ineffable tenderness which he alone can utter how do i know all this i saw much more i learned from her diary this i found in it from fiona macleod for truly that wandering voice that twilight whisper that breath so dewy sweet that flame winged lute player whom none sees but for a moment in a rainbow shimmer of joy or a sudden lightning flare of passion this exquisite mystery we call amor comes to some rapt visionaries at least not with a song upon the lips that all may hear or with blithe viol of public music but as one wrought by ecstasy dumbly eloquent with desire how to keep the flame winged lute player with his dumb eloquence of desire to feast him was to lose him their love for each other was a great love their granaries were overflowing with plenitude yet they wanted to keep the sharp famine edge of their love undulled nor were they lean little fledglings theorizing on the threshold of love they were robust and realized souls they had loved before with others in the days before they met and in those days they had throttled love with caresses and killed him with kisses and buried him in the pit of satiety they were not cold wraiths this man and woman they were warm human they had no saxon soberness in their blood the colour of it was sunset red they glowed with it temperamentally theirs was the french joy in the flesh they were idealists but their idealism was gallic it was not tempered by the chill and sombre fluid that for the english serves as blood there was no stoicism about them they were americans descended out of the english and yet the refraining and self denying of the english spirit groping were not theirs they were all this that i have said and they were made for joy only they achieved a concept a curse on concepts they played with logic and this was their logic but first let me tell you of a talk we had one night it was of gautier s madeline de maupin you remember the maid she kissed once and once only and kisses she would have no more not that she found kisses were not sweet but that she feared with repetition they would cloy satiety again she tried to play without stakes against the gods now this is contrary to a rule of the game the gods themselves have made only the rules are not posted over the table mortals must play in order to learn the rules well to the logic the man and the woman argued thus why kiss once only if to kiss once were wise was it not wiser to kiss not at all thus could they keep love alive fasting he would knock forever at their hearts perhaps it was out of their heredity that they achieved this unholy concept the breed will out and sometimes most fantastically thus in them did cursed albion array herself a scheming wanton a bold cold calculating and artful hussy after all i do not know but this i know it was out of their inordinate desire for joy that they forewent joy as he said i read it long afterward in one of his letters to her to hold you in my arms close and yet not close to yearn for you and never to have you and so always to have you and she for you to be always just beyond my reach to be ever attaining you and yet never attaining you and for this to last forever always fresh and new and always with the first flush upon us that is not the

used to this you will have the opportunity if you choose she laughed softly if i choose she repeated why it is all like fairyland to me he nodded you come he said from a very quiet life you will find things here different do you know what these are he touched a little row of black instruments which stood on the top of his desk she shook her head doubtfully i am not quite sure she admitted they are telephones he said this one touching the first is a private wire to my offices in wall street this one laying a finger upon the second is a private wire to the bank of which i am president these two he continued are connected with the two brokers whom i employ the other three are ordinary telephones two for long distance calls and one for the city when you came in i touched this knob on the floor beneath my foot all the telephones were at once disconnected here and connected with my secretaries room i can sit here at this table and shake the money markets of the world i can send stocks up or down at my will i can ruin if i like or i can enrich it is the fashion nowadays to speak lightly of the mere man of money yet there is no king on his throne who can shake the world as can we kings of

said i am a millionaire a good many times over or i should not be of much account in new york but there i have told you enough about myself i sent for you as you know because there are times when i feel a little lonely and i thought that if my sister could spare one of her children it would be a kindly act and one which i might perhaps be able to repay do you think that you would like to live here with me virginia and be mistress of this house she shrank a little away the prospect was not without its terrifying side why i should love it she declared but i simply shouldn t dare to think of it you don t understand i am afraid the way we live down at wellham springs we have really no servants and we do everything ourselves i couldn t attempt to manage a house like this he smiled at her kindly perhaps he said you would find it less difficult than you think there is a housekeeper already who sees to all the practical part of it she only needs to have some one to whom she can refer now and then you would have nothing whatever to do with the managing of the servants the commissariat or anything of that sort yours would be purely social duties i am afraid she answered that i should know even less about them well he said i have some good friends who will give you hints you will find it very much easier than you imagine you have only to be natural acquire the art of listening and wear pretty gowns and you will find it a simple matter to become quite a popular person she nerved herself to ask him a question he looked so kind and good natured that it did not seem possible that he would resent it uncle she said of course i am very glad to be here and it all sounds very delightful but what about stella he leaned back in his chair there was a pained look in his face she was almost sorry that she had mentioned his daughter s name perhaps he said it is as well that you should have asked me that question i have always been an indulgent father as i think you will find me an indulgent uncle but there are certain things certain offences i might say for which i have no forgiveness stella deceived me she made use of information secret information which she acquired in this room to benefit some man in whom she was interested she used my secrets to enrich this person she did this after i had warned her i never warn twice you mean that you sent her away she asked timidly i mean that my doors are closed to her he answered gravely as they would be closed upon you if you behaved as stella has behaved but my dear child he added smiling kindly at her i do not expect this from you i feel sure that what i have said will be sufficient if you will stay with me a little time and take my daughter s place i think you will not find me very stern or very ungrateful now i am going to ring for mrs perrin my housekeeper and she will show you your room to night you and i are going to dine quite alone and we can talk again then by the by do you really mean that you have never been to new york before never she answered i have been to boston twice never anywhere else he smiled well he said the sooner you are introduced to some of its wonders the better we will dine out to night and i will take you to one of the famous restaurants it will suit me better to be somewhere out of the way for an hour or two this evening there is a panic in chicago and illinois but there you

at the door he stopped quickly when pym looked up but during the remainder of the interview he emitted this whistle at intervals always with that anxious glance at his friend the door and its strained

never dreamt that you would come i have your letter engaging me in my pocket said tommy boldly and he laid it on the table pym surveyed it and him in comic dismay then with a sudden thought produced nearly a dozen letters from a drawer and dumped them down beside the other it was now his turn to look triumphant and tommy aghast pym s letters were all addressed from the dubb of prosen farm near thrums n b to different advertisers care of a london agency and were tommy s answers to the wants in a london newspaper which had found its way to the far north x y z was in need of a chemist s assistant and from his earliest years said one of the letters chemistry had been the study of studies for t sandys he was glad to read was t sandys that one who did not object to long hours would be preferred for it seemed to him that those who objected to long hours did not really love their work their heart was not in it and only where the heart is can the treasure be found had a vacancy for a page boy glasgow man for a photographer page boy must not be over fourteen photographer must not be under twenty i am a little over fourteen but i look less wrote t sandys to i am a little under twenty he wrote to glasgow man but i look more his heart was in the work to be a political organizer if h and h who advertised for one only knew how eagerly the undersigned desired to devote his life to political organizing in answer to scholastic s advertisement for janitor in a boys school t sandys begged to submit his name for consideration undoubtedly the noblest letter was the one applying for the secretaryship of a charitable society salary to begin at once but the candidate selected must deposit one hundred pounds the application was noble in its offer to make the work a labour of love and almost nobler in its argument that the hundred pounds was unnecessary rex had a vacancy in his drapery department t sandys had made a unique study of drapery lastly anon wanted an amanuensis salary said anon who seemed to be a humourist salary large but uncertain he added with equal candour drudgery great but to an intelligent man the pickings may be considerable pickings is there a finer word in the language t sandys had felt that he was particularly good at pickings but amanuensis the thing was unknown to him no one on the farm could tell him what it was but never mind his heart was in it all this correspondence had produced one reply the letter on which tommy s hand still rested it was a brief note signed o p pym and engaging mr sandys on his own recommendation if he really felt quite certain that his heart treasure included was in the work so far good tommy had thought when he received this answer but there was nothing in it to indicate the nature of the work nothing to show whether o p pym was scholastic or or rex or any other advertiser in particular stop there was a postscript i need not go into details about your duties as you assure me you are so well acquainted with

announcement that filmer interpreted wrongly as an anticipation of his idea now what precisely was filmer s idea really a very simple one before his time the pursuit of aeronautics had taken two divergent lines and had developed on the one hand balloons large apparatus lighter than air easy in ascent and comparatively safe in descent but floating helplessly before any breeze that took them and on the other flying machines that flew only in theory vast flat structures heavier than air propelled and kept up by heavy engines and for the most part smashing at the first descent but neglecting the fact that the inevitable final collapse rendered them impossible the weight of the flying machines gave them this theoretical advantage that they could go through the air against a wind a necessary condition if aerial navigation was to have any practical value it is filmer s particular merit that he perceived the way in which the contrasted and hitherto incompatible merits of balloon and heavy flying machine might be combined in one apparatus which should be at choice either heavier or lighter than air he took hints from the contractile bladders of fish and the pneumatic cavities of birds he devised an arrangement of contractile and absolutely closed balloons which when expanded could lift the actual flying apparatus with ease and when retracted by the complicated musculature he wove about them were withdrawn almost completely into the frame and he built the large framework which these balloons sustained of hollow rigid tubes the air in which by an ingenious contrivance was automatically pumped out as the apparatus fell and which then remained exhausted so long as the aeronaut desired there were no wings or propellers to his machine such as there had been to all previous aeroplanes and the only engine required was the compact and powerful little appliance needed to contract the balloons he perceived that such an apparatus as he had devised might rise with frame exhausted and balloons expanded to a considerable height might then contract its balloons and let the air into its frame and by an adjustment of its weights slide down the air in any desired direction as it fell it would accumulate velocity and at the same time lose weight and the momentum accumulated by its down rush could be utilised by means of a shifting of its weights to drive it up in the air again as the balloons expanded this conception which is still the structural conception of all successful flying machines needed however a vast amount of toil upon its details before it could actually be realised and such toil filmer as he was accustomed to tell the numerous interviewers who crowded upon him in the heyday of his fame ungrudgingly and unsparingly gave his particular difficulty was the elastic lining of the contractile balloon he found he needed a new substance and in the discovery and manufacture of that new substance he had as he never failed to impress upon the interviewers performed a far more arduous work than even in the actual achievement of my seemingly greater discovery but it must not be imagined that these interviews followed hard upon filmer s proclamation of his invention an interval of nearly five years elapsed during which he timidly remained at his rubber factory he seems to have been entirely dependent on his small income from this source making misdirected attempts to assure a quite indifferent public that he really had invented what he had invented he occupied the greater part of his leisure in the composition of letters to the scientific and daily press and so forth stating precisely the net result of his contrivances and demanding financial aid that alone would have sufficed for the suppression of his letters he spent such holidays as he could arrange in unsatisfactory interviews with the door keepers of leading london papers he was singularly not adapted for inspiring hall porters with confidence and he positively attempted to induce the war office to take up his work with him there remains a confidential letter from major general volleyfire to the earl of frogs the man s a crank and a bounder to boot says the major general in his bluff sensible army way and so left it open for the japanese to secure as they subsequently did the priority in this side of warfare a priority they still to our great discomfort retain and then by a stroke of luck the membrane filmer had invented for his contractile balloon was discovered to be useful for the valves of a new oil engine and he obtained the means for making a trial model of his invention he threw up his rubber factory appointment desisted from all further writing and with a certain secrecy that seems to have been an inseparable characteristic of all his proceedings set to work upon the apparatus he seems to have directed the making of its parts and collected most of it in a room in shoreditch but its final putting together was done at dymchurch in kent he did not make the affair large enough to carry a man but he made an extremely ingenious use of what were then called the marconi rays to control its flight the first flight of this first practicable flying machine took place over some fields near burford bridge near hythe in kent and filmer followed and controlled its flight upon a specially constructed motor tricycle the flight was considering all things an amazing success the apparatus was brought in a cart from dymchurch to burford bridge ascended there to a height of nearly three hundred feet swooped thence very nearly back to dymchurch came about in its sweep rose again circled and finally sank uninjured in a field behind the burford bridge inn at its descent a curious thing happened filmer got off his tricycle

has ceased to be a nation in itself and it will perhaps never again have anything like a national literature but that was something like a national literature and it will probably be centuries yet before the life of the whole country the american life as distinguished from the new england life shall have anything so like a national literature it will be long before our larger life interprets itself in such imagination as hawthorne s such wisdom as emerson s such poetry as longfellow s such prophecy as whittier s such wit and grace as holmes s such humor and humanity as lowell s the literature of those great men was if i may suffer myself the figure the socinian graft of a calvinist stock their faith in its varied shades was unitarian but their art was puritan so far as it was imperfect and great and beautiful as it was i think it had its imperfections it was marred by the intense ethicism that pervaded the new england mind for two hundred years and that still characterizes it they or their fathers had broken away from orthodoxy in the great schism at the beginning of the century but as if their heterodoxy were conscience stricken they still helplessly pointed the moral in all they did some pointed it more directly some less directly but they all pointed it i should be far from blaming them for their ethical intention though i think they felt their vocation as prophets too much for their good as poets sometimes they sacrificed the song to the sermon though not always nor nearly always it was in poetry and in romance that they excelled in the novel so far as they attempted it they failed i say this with the names of all the bostonian group and those they influenced in mind and with a full sense of their greatness it may be ungracious to say that they have left no heirs to their peculiar greatness but it would be foolish to say that they left an estate where they had none to bequeath one cannot take account of such a fantasy as judd s margaret the only new englander who has attempted the novel on a scale proportioned to the work of the new englanders in philosophy in poetry in romance is mr de forest who is of new haven and not of boston i do not forget the fictions of doctor holmes or the vivid inventions of doctor hale but i do not call them novels and i do not forget the exquisitely realistic art of miss jewett or miss wilkins which is free from the ethicism of the great new england group but which has hardly the novelists s scope new england in hawthorne s work achieved supremacy in romance but the romance is always an allegory and the novel is a picture in which the truth to life is suffered to do its unsermonized office for conduct and new england yet lacks her novelist because it was her instinct and her conscience in fiction to be true to an ideal of life rather than to life itself even when we come to the exception that proves the rule even to such a signal exception as uncle tom s cabin i think that what i say holds true that is almost the greatest work of imagination that we have produced in prose and it is the work of a new england woman writing from all the inspirations and traditions of new england it is like begging the question to say that i do not call it a novel however but really is it a novel in the sense that war and peace is a novel or madame flaubert or l assommoir or phineas finn or dona perfecta or esther waters or marta y maria or the return of the native or virgin soil or david grieve in a certain way it is greater than any of these except the first but its chief virtue or its prime virtue is in its address to the conscience and not its address to the taste to the ethical sense not the aesthetical sense this does not quite say the thing but it suggests it and i should be sorry if it conveyed to any reader a sense of slight for i believe no one has felt more deeply than myself the value of new england in literature the comparison of the literary situation at boston to the literary situation at edinburgh in the times of the reviewers has never seemed to me accurate or adequate and it holds chiefly in the fact that both seem to be of the past certainly new york is yet no london in literature and i think boston was once vastly more than edinburgh ever was at least in quality the scotch literature of the palmy days was not wholly scotch and even when it was rooted in scotch soil it flowered in the air of an alien speech but the new england literature of the great day was the blossom of a new england root and the language which the bostonians wrote was the native english of scholars fitly the heirs of those who had brought the learning of the universities to massachusetts bay two hundred years before and was of as pure a lineage as the english of the mother country iii the literary situation which confronted me when i came to boston was then as native as could well be and whatever value i may be able to give a personal study of it will be from the effect it made upon me as one strange in everything but sympathy i will not pretend that i saw it in its entirety and i have no hope of presenting anything like a kinetoscopic impression of it what i can do is to give here and there a glimpse of it and i shall wish the reader to keep in mind the fact that it was in a state of transition as everything is always and everywhere it was no sooner recognizably native than it ceased to be fully so and i became a witness of it after the change had begun the publishing house which so long embodied new england literature was already attempting enterprises out of the line of its traditions and one of these had brought mr t b aldrich from new york a few weeks before i arrived upon the scene in that dramatic quality which i think neve

surviving village houses in the tail of the high street had a submerged air an air of hiding from something that was looking for it when they had made up the pavement of the high street they levelled that up so that one had to go down three steps into the shop tom did his best to sell only his own excellent but limited range of produce but progress came shoving things into his window french artichokes and aubergines foreign apples apples from the state of new york apples from california apples from canada apples from new zealand pretty lookin fruit but not what i should call english apples said tom bananas unfamiliar nuts grape fruits mangoes the motor cars that went by northward and southward grew more and more powerful and efficient whizzed faster and smelt worse there appeared great clangorous petrol trolleys delivering coal and parcels in the place of vanishing horse vans motor omnibuses ousted the horse omnibuses even the kentish strawberries going londonward in the night took to machinery and clattered instead of creaking and became affected in flavour by progress and petrol and then young bert smallways got a motor bicycle bert it is necessary to explain was a progressive smallways nothing speaks more eloquently of the pitiless insistence of progress and expansion in our time than that it should get into the smallways blood but there was something advanced and enterprising about young smallways before he was out of short frocks he was lost for a whole day before he was five and nearly drowned in the reservoir of the new water works before he was seven he had a real pistol taken away from him by a real policeman when he was ten and he learnt to smoke not with pipes and brown paper and cane as tom had done but with a penny packet of boys of england american cigarettes his language shocked his father before he was twelve and by that age what with touting for parcels at the station and selling the bun hill weekly express he was making three shillings a week or more and spending it on chips comic cuts ally sloper s half holiday cigarettes and all the concomitants of a life of pleasure and enlightenment all of this without hindrance to his literary studies which carried him up to the seventh standard at an exceptionally early age i mention these things so that you may have no doubt at all concerning the sort of stuff bert had in him he was six years younger than tom and for a time there was an attempt to utilise him in the green grocer s shop when tom at twenty one married jessica who was thirty and had saved a little money in service but it was not bert s forte to be utilised he hated digging and when he was given a basket of stuff to deliver a nomadic instinct arose irresistibly it became his pack and he did not seem to care how heavy it was nor where he took it so long as he did not take it to its destination glamour filled the world and he strayed after it basket and all so tom took his goods out himself and sought employers for bert who did not know of this strain of poetry in his nature and bert touched the fringe of a number of trades in succession draper s porter chemist s boy doctor s page junior assistant gas fitter envelope addresser milk cart assistant golf caddie and at last helper in a bicycle shop here apparently he found the progressive quality his nature had craved his employer was a pirate souled young man named grubb with a black smeared face by day and a music hall side in the evening who dreamt of a patent lever chain and it seemed to bert that he was the perfect model of a gentleman of spirit he hired out quite the dirtiest and unsafest bicycles in the whole south of england and conducted the subsequent discussions with astonishing verve bert and he settled down very well together bert lived in became almost a trick rider he could ride bicycles for miles that would have come to pieces instantly under you or me took to washing his face after business and spent his surplus money upon remarkable ties and collars cigarettes and shorthand classes at the bun hill institute he would go round to tom at times and look and talk so brilliantly that tom and jessie who both had a natural tendency to be respectful to anybody or anything looked up to him immensely he s a go ahead chap is bert said tom he knows a thing or two let s hope he don t know too much said jessica who had a fine sense of limitations it s go ahead times said tom noo petaters and english at that we ll be having em in march if things go on as they do go i never see such times see his tie last night it wasn t suited to him tom it was a gentleman s tie he wasn t up to it not the rest of him it wasn t becoming then presently bert got a cyclist s suit cap badge and all and to see him and

glass of something hot at bedtime what care we take about feeding the lucky body which of us does as much for his mind and what causes the difference is the body so much the more important of the two by no means but life depends on the body being fed whereas we can continue to exist as animals scarcely as men though the mind be utterly starved and neglected therefore nature provides that in case of serious neglect of the body such terrible consequences of discomfort and pain shall ensue as will soon bring us back to a sense of our duty and some of the functions necessary to life she does for us altogether leaving us no choice in the matter it would fare but ill with many of us if we were left to superintend our own digestion and circulation bless me one would cry i forgot to wind up my heart this morning to think that it has been standing still for the last three hours i can t walk with you this afternoon a friend would say as i have no less than eleven dinners to digest i had to let them stand over from last week being so busy and my doctor says he will not answer for the consequences if i wait any longer well it is i say for us that the consequences of neglecting the body can be clearly seen and felt and it might be well for some if the mind were equally visible and tangible if we could take it say to the doctor and have its pulse felt why what have you been doing with this mind lately how have you fed it it looks pale and the pulse is very slow well doctor it has not had much regular food lately i gave it a lot of sugar plums yesterday sugar plums what kind well they were a parcel of conundrums sir ah i thought so now just mind this if you go on playing tricks like that you ll spoil all its teeth and get laid up with mental indigestion you must have nothing but the plainest reading for the next few days take care now no novels on any account considering the amount of painful experience many of us have had in feeding and dosing the body it would i think be quite worth our while to try and translate some of the rules into corresponding ones for the mind first then we should set ourselves to provide for our mind its proper kind of food we very soon learn what will and what will not agree with the body and find little difficulty in refusing a piece of the tempting pudding or pie which is associated in our memory with that terrible attack of indigestion and whose very name irresistibly recalls rhubarb and magnesia but it takes a great many lessons to convince us how indigestible some of our favourite lines of reading are and again and again we make a meal of the unwholesome novel sure to be followed by its usual train of low spirits unwillingness to work weariness of existence in fact by mental nightmare then we should be careful to provide this wholesome food in proper amount mental gluttony or over reading is a dangerous propensity tending to weakness of digestive power and in some cases to loss of appetite we know that bread is a good and wholesome food but who would like to try the experiment of eating two or three loaves at a sitting i have heard a physician telling his patient whose complaint was merely gluttony and want of exercise that the earliest symptom of hyper nutrition is a deposition of adipose tissue and no doubt the fine long words greatly consoled the poor man under his increasing load of fat i wonder if there is such a thing in nature as a fat mind i really think i have met with one or two minds which could not keep up with the slowest trot in conversation could not jump over a logical fence to save their lives always got stuck fast in a narrow argument and in short were fit for nothing but to waddle helplessly through the world then again though the food be wholesome and in proper amount we know that we must not consume too many kinds at once take the thirsty a quart of beer or a quart of cider or even a quart of cold tea and he will probably thank you though not so heartily in the last case but what think you his feelings would be if you offered him a tray containing a little mug of beer a little mug of cider another of cold tea one of hot tea one of coffee one of cocoa and corresponding vessels of milk water brandy and water and butter milk the sum total might be a quart but would it be the same thing to the haymaker having settled the proper kind amount and variety of our mental food it remains that we should be careful to allow proper intervals between meal and meal and not swallow the food hastily without mastication so that it may be thoroughly digested both which rules for the body are also applicable at once to the mind first as to the intervals these are as really necessary as they are for the body with this difference only that while the body requires three or four hours rest before it is ready for another meal the mind will in many cases do with three or four minutes i believe that the interval required is much shorter than is generally supposed and from personal experience i would recommend anyone who has to devote several hours together to one subject of thought to try the effect of such a break say once an hour l

had consented to his going to sea full of life and spirit madam the mayor repeated more angrily than before let me tell you it is these fellows who are full of life and adventure who come to the

and although i admit that the lad was very wrong to knock him down when he struck him i think my dear i should have done the same had i been in his place then madam mr anthony said solemnly you would

by the mayor as he was talking to his daughter at the back gate of the garden had made his way down to the wharves and there seating himself upon a pile of wood had stared moodily at the tract of mud extending from his feet to the strip of water far away his position was indeed an unenviable one as mrs anthony had said his father was a clergyman of the church of england the vicar of a snug living in lincolnshire but he had been cast out when the parliamentarians gained the upper hand and his living was handed over to a sectarian preacher when after years of poverty king charles came to the throne the dispossessed minister thought that as a matter of course he should be restored to his living but it was not so as in hundreds of other cases the new occupant conformed at once to the new

surviving him only one year her death took place at southampton where she had moved after the loss of her husband having no further tie at oxford and a week later jack stilwell found himself domiciled

windsor blenheim oxford the bath and bristol all into one letter all those remarkable places lying in a line as it were in one point of the compass as to have made my letter too long or my observations too light and superficial as others have done before me this letter will divide the weighty task and consequently make it sit lighter on the memory be pleasanter to the reader and make my progress the more regular i shall therefore take in hampton court and windsor in this journey the first at my setting out and the last at my return and the rest as their situation demands as i came down from kingston in my last circuit by the south bank of the thames on the surrey side of the river so i go up to hampton court now on the north bank and on the middlesex side which i mention because as the sides of the country bordering on the river lie parallel so the beauty of the country the pleasant situations the glory of innumerable fine buildings noblemen s and gentlemen s houses and citizens retreats are so equal a match to what i had described on the other side that one knows not which to give the preference to but as i must speak of them again when i come to write of the county of middlesex which i have now purposely omitted so i pass them over here except the palace of hampton only which i mentioned in middlesex for the reasons above hampton court lies on the north bank of the river thames about two small miles from kingston and on the road from staines to kingston bridge so that the road straightening the parks a little they were obliged to part the parks and leave the paddock and the great park part on the other side the road a testimony of that just regard that the kings of england always had and still have to the common good and to the service of the country that they would not interrupt the course of the road or cause the poor people to go out of the way of their business to or from the markets and fairs for any pleasure of their own whatsoever the palace of hampton court was first founded and built from the ground by that great statesman and favourite of king henry viii cardinal wolsey and if it be a just observation anywhere as is made from the situation of the old abbeys and monasteries the clergy were excellent judges of the beauty and pleasantness of the country and chose always to plant in the best i say if it was a just observation in any case it was in this for if there be a situation on the whole river between staines bridge and windsor bridge pleasanter than another it is this of hampton close to the river yet not offended by the rising of its waters in floods or storms near to the reflux of the tides but not quite so near as to be affected with any foulness of the water which the flowing of the tides generally is the occasion of the gardens extend almost to the bank of the river yet are never overflowed nor are there any marshes on either side the river to make the waters stagnate or the air unwholesome on that account the river is high enough to be navigable and low enough to be a little pleasantly rapid so that the stream looks always cheerful not slow and sleeping like a pond this keeps the waters always clear and clean the bottom in view the fish playing and in sight and in a word it has everything that can make an inland or as i may call it a country river pleasant and agreeable i shall sing you no songs here of the river in the first person of a water nymph a goddess and i know not what according to the humour of the ancient poets i shall talk nothing of the marriage of old isis the male river with the beautiful thame the female river a whimsey as simple as the subject was empty but i shall speak of the river as occasion presents as it really is made glorious by the splendour of its shores gilded with noble palaces strong fortifications large hospitals and public buildings with the greatest bridge and the greatest city in the world made famous by the opulence of its merchants the increase and extensiveness of its commerce by its invincible navies and by the innumerable fleets of ships sailing upon it to and from all parts of the world as i meet with the river upwards in my travels through the inland country i shall speak of it as it is the channel for conveying an infinite quantity of provisions from remote counties to london and enriching all the counties

looking at anybody called out all aboard with a perfunctory air of supreme indifference whether the invitation was heeded remounted his box and drove stolidly away perhaps it was well that he did so for the conversation at once assumed a disrespectful attitude toward tom and his relatives it was more than intimated that tom s alleged aunt was none other than tom s real mother while it was also asserted that tom s alleged uncle did not himself participate in this intimate relationship to the boy to an extent which the fastidious taste of angel s deemed moral and necessary popular opinion also believed that islington the adopted father who received a certain stipend ostensibly for the boy s support retained it as a reward for his reticence regarding these facts he ain t ruinin hisself

turned from the frivolity of conversation to his severer professional duties it was also well that bill s momentary attitude of didactic propriety was not further excited by the subsequent conduct of his protege for by this time tom half supporting the unstable johnson who developed a tendency to occasionally dash across the glaring road but checked himself mid way each time reached the corral which adjoined the mansion house at its farther extremity was a pump and horse trough here without a word being spoken but evidently in obedience to some habitual custom tom led his companion with the boy s assistance johnson removed his coat and neckcloth turned back the collar of his shirt and gravely placed his head beneath the pump spout with equal gravity and deliberation tom took his place at the handle for a few moments only the splashing of water and regular strokes of the pump broke the solemnly ludicrous silence then there was a pause in which johnson put his hands to his dripping head felt of it critically as if it belonged to somebody else and raised his eyes to his companion that ought to fetch it said tom in answer to the look ef it don t replied johnson doggedly with an air of relieving himself of all further responsibility in the matter it s got to thet s all if it referred to some change in the physiognomy of johnson it had probably been fetched by the process just indicated the head that went under the pump was large and clothed with bushy uncertain colored hair the face was flushed puffy and expressionless the eyes injected and full the head that came out from under the pump was of smaller size and different shape the hair straight dark and sleek the face pale and hollow cheeked the eyes bright and restless in the haggard nervous ascetic that rose from the horse trough there was very little trace of the bacchus that had bowed there a moment before familiar as tom must have been with the spectacle he could not help looking inquiringly at the trough as if expecting to see some traces of the previous johnson in its shallow depths a narrow strip of willow alder and buckeye a mere dusty ravelled fringe of the green mantle that swept the high shoulders of table mountain lapped the edge of the corral the silent pair were quick to avail themselves of even its scant shelter from the overpowering sun they had not proceeded far before johnson who was walking quite rapidly in advance suddenly brought himself up and turned to his companion with an interrogative eh i didn t speak said tommy quietly who said you spoke said johnson with a quick look of cunning in course you didn t speak and i didn t speak neither nobody spoke wot makes you think you spoke he continued peering curiously into tommy s eyes the smile which habitually shone there quickly vanished as the boy stepped quietly to his companion s side and took his arm without a word in course you didn t speak tommy said johnson deprecatingly you ain t a boy to go for to play an ole soaker

gave back of my face it was skin and hair thickly encrusted with clay and rootlets having taken a long drink i threw off my clothes to have a bath and after splashing about for half an hour managed to rid my skin of its accumulations of dirt while drying in the wind i shook the loose sand and clay from my garments then dressed and feeling greatly refreshed proceeded on my walk for an hour or so i followed the valley in its many windings but failing to see any dwelling place i ascended a hill to get a view of the surrounding country the prospect which disclosed itself when i had got a couple of hundred feet above the surrounding level appeared unfamiliar the hills among which i had been wandering were now behind me before me spread a wide rolling country beyond which rose a mountain range resembling in the distance blue banked up clouds with summits and peaks of pearly whiteness looking on this scene i could hardly refrain from shouting with joy so glad did the sunlit expanse of earth and the pure exhilarating mountain breeze make me feel the season was late summer that was plain to see the ground was moist as if from recent showers and the earth everywhere had that intense living greenness with which it reclothes itself when the greater heats are over but the foliage of the woods was already beginning to be touched here and there with the yellow and russet hues of decay a more tranquil and soul satisfying scene could not be imagined the dear old mother earth was looking her very best while the shifting golden sunlight the mysterious haze in the distance and the glint of a wide stream not very far off seemed to spiritualize her happy autumn fields and bring them into a closer kinship with the blue over arching sky there was one large house or mansion in sight but no town nor even a hamlet and not one solitary spire in vain i scanned the horizon waiting impatiently to see the distant puff of white steam from some passing engine this troubled me not a little for i had no idea that i had drifted so far from civilization in my search for specimens or whatever it was that brought me to this pretty primitive wilderness not quite a wilderness however for there within a short hour s walk of the hill stood the one great stone mansion close to the river i had mentioned there were also horses and cows in sight and a number of scattered sheep were grazing on the hillside beneath me strange to relate i met with a little misadventure on account of the sheep an animal which one is accustomed to regard as of a timid and inoffensive nature when i set out at a brisk pace to walk to the house i have spoken of in order to make some inquiries there a few of the sheep that happened to be near began to bleat loudly as if alarmed and by and by they came hurrying after me apparently in a great state of excitement i did not mind them much but presently a pair of horses attracted by their bleatings also seemed struck at my appearance and came at a swift gallop to within twenty yards of me they were magnificent looking brutes evidently a pair of well groomed carriage horses for their coats which were of a fine bronze color sparkled wonderfully in the sunshine in other respects they were very unlike carriage animals for they had tails reaching to the ground like funeral horses and immense black leonine manes which gave them a strikingly bold and somewhat formidable appearance for some moments they stood with heads erect gazing fixedly at me and then simultaneously delivered a snort of defiance or astonishment so loud and sudden that it startled me like the report of a gun this tremendous equine blast brought yet another enemy on the field in the shape of a huge milk white bull with long horns a very noble kind of animal but one which i always prefer to admire from behind a hedge or at a distance through a field glass fortunately his wrathful mutterings gave me timely notice of his approach and without waiting to discover his intentions i incontinently fled down the slope to the refuge of a grove or belt of trees clothing the lower portion of the hillside spent and panting from my run i embraced a big tree and turning to face the foe found that i had not been followed sheep horses and bull were all grouped together just where i had left them apparently holding a consultation or comparing notes the trees where i had sought shelter were old and grew here and there singly or in scattered groups it was a pretty wilderness of mingled tree shrub and flower i was surprised to find here some very large and ancient looking fig trees and numbers of wasps and flies were busy feeding on a few over ripe figs on the higher branches honey bees also roamed about everywhere extracting sweets from the autumn bloom and filling the sunny glades with a soft monotonous murmur of sound walking on full of happy thoughts and a keen sense of the sweetness of life pervading me i presently noticed that a multitude of small birds were gathering about me flitting through the trees overhead and the bushes on either hand but always keeping near me apparently as much excited at my presence as if i had been a gigantic owl or some such unnatural monster their increasing numbers and incessant excited chirping and chattering at first served to amuse but in the end began to irritate me i observed too that the alarm was spreading and that larger birds usually shy of men pigeons jays and magpies i fancied they were now began to make their appearance could it be thought i with some concern that i had wandered into some uninhabited wilderness to cause so great a commotion among the little feathered people i very soon dismissed this as an idle thought for one does not find houses domestic animals and fruit trees in

as you meet there i shall sleep out to night tain t raining elizabeth uttered a piercing cry serves you right growled peter savagely how can anyone help treading on you when you will get just between one s legs told you of it a hundred times the truth of the matter was that peter was becoming very angry with himself for no reason whatever as he told himself his memory would persist in wandering to ilford cemetery in a certain desolate corner of which lay a fragile little woman whose lungs had been but ill adapted to breathing london fogs with on the top of her a still smaller and still more fragile mite of humanity that in compliment to its only relative worth a penny piece had been christened thomas a name common enough in all conscience as peter had reminded himself more than once in the name of common sense what had dead and buried tommy hope to do with this affair the whole thing was the veriest sentiment and sentiment was mr peter hope s abomination had he not penned articles innumerable pointing out its baneful influence upon the age had he not always condemned it wherever he had come across it in play or book now and then the suspicion had crossed peter s mind that in spite of all this he was somewhat of a sentimentalist himself things had suggested this to him the fear had always made him savage you wait here till i come back he growled seizing the astonished tommy by the worsted comforter and spinning it into the centre of the room sit down and don t you dare to move and peter went out and slammed the door behind him bit off his chump ain t he remarked tommy to elizabeth as the sound of peter s descending footsteps died away people had a way of addressing remarks to elizabeth something in her manner invited this oh well it s all in the day s work

side she found herself confronted by a young man the new master of the house who looked more like a foreigner than an englishman who when he was congratulated in view of the approaching season on the admirable preservation of his partridges and pheasants betrayed an utter want of interest in the subject and who showed no sense of shame in acknowledging that his principal amusements were derived from reading books and collecting insects how i must have disappointed mrs roylake and how considerately she hid from me the effect that i had produced turning next to my own impressions i discovered in my newly found relative a little light eyed light haired elegant woman trim and bright and smiling dressed to perfection clever to her fingers ends skilled in making herself agreeable and yet in spite of these undeniable fascinations perfectly incomprehensible to me after my experience of foreign society i was incapable of understanding the extraordinary importance which my stepmother seemed to attach to rank and riches entirely for their own sakes when she described my unknown neighbors from one end of the county to the other she took it for granted that i must be interested in them on account of their titles and their fortunes she held me up to my own face as a kind of idol to myself without producing any better reason than might be found in my inheritance of an income of sixteen thousand pounds and when i expressed in excusing myself for not accompanying her uninvited to the dinner party a perfectly rational doubt whether i might prove to be a welcome guest mrs roylake held up her delicate little hands in unutterable astonishment my dear gerard in your position she appeared to think that this settled the question i submitted in silence the truth is i was beginning already to despair of my prospects kind as my stepmother was and agreeable as she was what chance could i see of establishing any true sympathy between us and if my neighbors resembled her in their ways of thinking what hope could i feel of finding new friends in england to replace the friends in germany whom i had lost a stranger among my own country people with the every day habits and every day pleasures of my youthful life left behind me without plans or hopes to interest me in looking at the future it is surely not wonderful that my spirits had sunk to their lowest ebb and that i even failed to appreciate with sufficient gratitude the fortunate accident of my birth perhaps the journey to england had fatigued me or perhaps the controlling influences of the dark and silent night proved irresistible this only is certain my solitary meditations under the tree ended in sleep i was awakened by a light falling on my face the moon had risen in the outward part of the wood beyond which i had not advanced the pure and welcome light penetrated easily through the scattered trees i got up and looked about me a path into the wood now showed itself broader and better kept than any path that i could remember in the days of my boyhood the moon showed it to me plainly and my curiosity was aroused following the new track i found that it led to a little glade which i at once recognized the place was changed in one respect only a neglected water spring had been cleared of brambles and stones and had been provided with a drinking cup a rustic seat and a latin motto on a marble slab the spring at once reminded me of a greater body of water a river at some little distance farther on which ran between the trees on one side and the desolate open country on the other ascending from the glade i found myself in one of the narrow woodland paths familiar to me in the by gone time unless my memory was at fault this was the way which led to an old water mill on the river bank the image of the great turning wheel which half frightened half fascinated me when i was a child now presented itself to my memory for the first time after an interval of many years in my present frame of mind the old scene appealed to me with the irresistible influence of an old friend i said to myself shall i walk on and try if i can find the river and the mill again this perfectly trifling question to decide presented to me nevertheless fantastic difficulties so absurd that they might have been difficulties encountered in a dream to my own astonishment i hesitated walked back again along the path by which i had advanced reconsidered my decision without knowing why and turning in the opposite direction set my face towards the river once more i wonder how my life would have ended if i had gone the other way chapter ii the river introduces us i stood alone on the bank of the ugliest stream in england the moonlight pouring its unclouded radiance over open space failed to throw a beauty not their own on those sluggish waters broad and muddy their stealthy current flowed onward to the sea without a rock to diversify without a bubble to break the sullen surface on the side from which i was looking at the river the neglected trees grew so close together that they were undermining their own lives and poisoning each other on the opposite bank a rank growth of gigantic bulrushes hid the ground beyond except where it rose in hillocks and showed its surface of desert sand spotted here and there by mean patches of health a repellent river in itself a repellent river in its surroundings a repellent river even in its name it was called the loke neither popular tradition nor antiquarian research could explain what the name meant or could tell when the name had been

filling the frosty air with peals of laughter and cries of triumph as they flew by in every conceivable attitude for the fun was at its height now and the oldest and gravest observers felt a glow of pleasure as they looked remembering their own young days jack take me down that coast joe said i wouldn t dare to do it so i must commanded jill as they paused for breath after the long trudge up hill jill of course was not her real name but had been given because of her friendship with jack who so admired janey pecq s spirit and fun i guess i wouldn t it is very bumpy and ends in a big drift not

wilful jill it is very nice but i won t be told i don t dare by any boy in the world if you are afraid i ll go alone and before he could speak she had snatched the rope from his hand thrown herself upon the sled and was off helter skelter down the most dangerous coast on the hill side she did not get far however for starting in a hurry she did not guide her steed with care and the red charger landed her in the snow half way down where she lay laughing till jack came to pick her up if you will go i ll take you down all right i m not afraid for i ve done it a dozen times with the other fellows but we gave it up because it is short and bad he said still good natured though a little hurt at the charge of cowardice for jack was as brave as a little lion and with the best sort of bravery the courage to do right so it is but i must do it a few times or joe will plague me and spoil my fun to night answered jill shaking her skirts and rubbing her blue hands wet and cold with the

warm and they do fit must be too small for your paws so i ll knit you a new pair for christmas and make you wear them too said jill putting on the mittens with a nod of thanks and ending her speech with a stamp of her rubber boots to enforce her threat jack laughed and up they trudged to the spot whence the three coasts diverged now which will you have he asked with a warning look in the honest blue eyes which often unconsciously controlled naughty jill against her will that one and the red mitten pointed firmly to the perilous path just tried you will do it i will come on then and hold tight jack s smile was gone now and he waited without a word while jill tucked herself up then took his place in front and off they went on the brief breathless trip straight into the drift by the fence below i don t see anything very awful in that come up and have another joe is watching us and i d like to show him that we aren t afraid of anything said jill with a defiant glance at a distant boy who had paused to watch the descent it is a regular go bang if that is what you like answered jack as they plowed their way up again it is you boys think girls like little mean coasts without any fun or danger in them as if we couldn t be brave and strong as well as you give me three go bangs and then we ll stop my tumble doesn t count so give me two more and then i ll be good jill took her seat as she spoke and looked up with such a rosy pleading face that jack gave in at once and down they went again raising a cloud of glittering snow dust as they reined up in fine style with their feet on the fence it s just splendid now one more cried jill excited by the cheers of a sleighing party passing below proud of his skill jack marched back resolved to make the third go the crowning achievement of the afternoon while jill pranced after him as lightly as if the big boots were the famous seven leagued ones and chattering about the candy scrape and whether there would be nuts or not so full were they of this important question that they piled on hap hazard and started off still talking so busily that jill forgot to hold tight and jack to steer carefully alas for the candy scrape that never was to be alas for poor thunderbolt blindly setting forth on the last trip he ever made and oh alas for jack and jill who wilfully chose the wrong road and ended their fun for the winter no one knew how it happened but instead of landing in the drift or at the fence there was a great crash against the bars a dreadful plunge off the steep bank a sudden scattering of girl boy sled fence

girl or no he read iduna aright moreover if ragnar did not like iduna from the first iduna hated ragnar so it came about that although both my father thorvald and iduna s father athalbrand stormed and

many men also harps make merry music at a feast moreover olaf is brave enough how can he be otherwise coming of the stock he does he is thin and weedy objected athalbrand a saying that made my mother angry nay lord athalbrand she said he is tall and straight as a dart and will yet be the handsomest man in these parts every duck thinks it has hatched out a swan grumbled athalbrand while with my eyes i implored my mother to be silent then he thought for awhile pulling at his long forked beard and said at last my heart tells me no good of such a marriage iduna who is the only one left to me could marry a man of more wealth and power than this rune making stripling is ever likely to be yet just now i know none such whom i would wish to hold my place when i am gone moreover it is spread far and wide throughout the land that my daughter is to be wed to thorvald s son and it matters little to which son at least i will not have it said that she has been given the go by therefore let this olaf take her if she will have him only he added with a growl let him play no tricks like that red headed cub his brother ragnar if he would not taste of a spear through his liver now i go to learn iduna s mind so he went as did my father and mother leaving me alone thinking and thanking the gods for the chance that had come my way yes and blessing ragnar and that brown eyed wench who had thrown her spell over him whilst i stood thus i heard a sound and turning saw iduna gliding towards me in the blue twilight looking more lovely than a dream at my side she stopped and said my father tells me you wish to speak with me and she laughed a little softly and held me with her beautiful eyes after that i know not what happened till i saw iduna bending towards me like a willow in the wind and then oh joy of joys felt her kiss upon my lips now my speech was unsealed and i told her the tale that lovers have always told how that i was ready to die for her to which she answered that she had rather that i lived since ghosts were no good husbands how that i was not worthy of her to which she answered that i was young with all my time before me and might live to be greater than i thought as she believed i should and so forth only one more thing comes back to me of that blissful hour foolishly i said what i had been thinking namely that i blessed ragnar at these words of a sudden iduna s face grew stern and the lovelight in her eyes was changed to such as gleams from swords i do not bless ragnar she answered i hope one day to see ragnar and she checked herself adding come let us enter olaf i hear my father calling me to mix his sleeping cup so we went into the house hand in hand and when they saw us coming thus all gathered there burst into shouts of laughter after their rude fashion moreover beakers were thrust into our hands and we were made to drink from them and swear some oath thus ended our betrothal i think it was on the next day that we sailed for home in my father s largest ship of war which was named the swan i went unwillingly enough who desired to drink more of the delight of iduna s eyes still go i must since athalbrand would have it so the marriage he said should take place at aar at the time of the spring feast and not before meanwhile he held it best we should be apart that we might learn whether we still clung to each other in absence these were the reasons he gave but i think that he was already somewhat sorry for what he had done and reflected

horses on the pole spring back into the chariots anyhow and as soon as they were safe the horses tore away again the britons had a strange and terrible religion called the religion of the druids it seems to have been brought over in very early times indeed from the opposite country of france anciently called gaul and to have mixed up the worship of the serpent and of the sun and moon with the worship of some of the heathen gods and goddesses most of its ceremonies were kept secret by the priests the druids who pretended to be enchanters and who carried magicians wands and wore each of them about his neck what he told the ignorant people was a serpent s egg in a golden case but it is certain that the druidical ceremonies included the sacrifice of human victims the torture of some suspected criminals and on particular occasions even the burning alive in immense wicker cages of a number of men and animals together the druid priests had some kind of veneration for the oak and for the mistletoe the same plant that we hang up in houses at christmas time now when its white berries grew upon the oak they met together in dark woods which they called sacred groves and there they instructed in their mysterious arts young men who came to them as pupils and who sometimes stayed with them as long as twenty years these druids built great temples and altars open to the sky fragments of some of which are yet remaining stonehenge on salisbury plain in wiltshire is the most extraordinary of these three curious stones called kits coty house on bluebell hill near maidstone in kent form another we know from examination of the great blocks of which such buildings are made that they could not have been raised without the aid of some ingenious machines which are common now but which the ancient britons certainly did not use in making their own uncomfortable houses i should not wonder if the druids and their pupils who stayed with them twenty years knowing more than the rest of the britons kept the people out of sight while they made these buildings and then pretended that they built them by magic perhaps they had a hand in the fortresses too at all events as they were very powerful and very much believed in and as they made and executed the laws and paid no taxes i don t wonder that they liked their trade and as they persuaded the people the more druids there were the better off the people would be i don t wonder that there were a good many of them but it is pleasant to think that there are no druids now who go on in that way and pretend to carry enchanters wands and serpents eggs and of course there is nothing of the kind anywhere such was the improved condition of the ancient britons fifty five years before the birth of our saviour when the romans under their great general julius caesar were masters of all the rest of the known world julius caesar had then just conquered gaul and hearing in gaul a good deal about the opposite island with the white cliffs and about the bravery of the britons who inhabited it some of whom had been fetched over to help the gauls in the war against him he resolved as he was so near to come and conquer britain next so julius caesar came sailing over to this island of ours with eighty vessels and twelve thousand men and he came from the french coast between calais and boulogne because thence was the shortest passage into britain just for the same reason as our steam boats now take the same track every day he expected to conquer britain easily but it was not such easy work as he supposed for the bold britons fought most bravely and what with not having his horse soldiers with him for they had been driven back by a storm and what with having some of his vessels dashed to pieces by a high tide after they were drawn ashore he ran great risk of being totally defeated however for once that the bold britons beat him he beat them twice though not so soundly but that he was very glad to accept their proposals of peace and go away but in the spring of the next year he came back this time with eight hundred vessels and thirty thousand men the british tribes chose as their general in chief a briton whom the romans in their latin language called cassivellaunus but whose british name is supposed to have been caswallon a brave general he was and well he and his soldiers fought the roman army so well that whenever in that war the roman soldiers saw a great cloud of dust and heard the rattle of the rapid british chariots they trembled in their hearts besides a number of smaller battles there was a battle fought near canterbury in kent there was a battle fought near chertsey in surrey there was a battle fought near a marshy little town in a wood the capital of that part of britain which belonged to cassivellaunus and which was probably near what is now saint albans in hertfordshire however brave cassivellaunus had the worst of it on the whole though he and his men always fought like lions as the other british chiefs were jealous of him and were always quarrelling with him and with one another he gave up and proposed peace julius caesar was very glad to grant peace easily and to go away again with all his remaining ships and men he had expected to find pearls in britain and he may have found a few for anything i know but at all events he found delicious oysters and i am sure he found tough britons of whom i dare say he made the same complaint as napoleon bonaparte the great french general did eighteen hundred years afte

greatest characters like st paul st bernard or luther at least it is no proper object of blame for it is constantly the companion of lofty and generous aspiration it was perhaps unfortunate that condorcet should have permitted himself to be drawn into a position where his want of that magical quality by which even marat could gain the sympathies of men should be so conspicuously made visible the character of condorcet unlike so many of his contemporaries offers nothing to the theatrical instinct none the less on this account should we be willing to weigh the contributions which he made to the stock of science and social speculation and recognise the fine elevation of his sentiments his noble solicitude for human wellbeing his eager and resolute belief in its indefinite expansion and the devotion which sealed his faith by a destiny that was as tragical as any in those bloody and most tragical days i until the outbreak of the revolution the circumstances of condorcet s life were as little externally disturbed or specially remarkable as those of any other geometer and thinker of the time he was born at a small town in picardy in the year his father was a cavalry officer but as he died when his son was only three years old he could have exerted no influence upon the future philosopher save such as comes of transmission through blood and tissue condillac was his uncle but there is no record of any intercourse between them his mother was a devout and trembling soul who dedicated her child to the holy virgin and for eight years or more made him wear the dress of a little girl by way of sheltering him against the temptations and unbelief of a vile world so long as women are held by opinion and usage in a state of educational and political subjection which prevents the growth of a large intelligence made healthy and energetic by knowledge and by activity we may expect pious extravagances of this kind condorcet was weakened physically by much confinement and the constraint of cumbrous clothing and not even his dedication to the holy virgin prevented him from growing up the most ardent of the admirers of voltaire his earliest instructors as happened to most of the sceptical philosophers were the jesuits then within a few years of their fall that these adroit men armed with all the arts and traditions which their order had acquired in three centuries and with the training of the nation almost exclusively in their hands should still have been unable to shield their persons from proscription and their creed from hatred is a remarkable instance how little it avails ecclesiastical bodies to have a monopoly of official education if the spirit of their teaching be out of harmony with those most potent agencies which we sum up as the spirit of the time the jesuits were the great official instructors of france for the first half of the eighteenth century in the order was thrust forth from the country and they left behind them an army of the bitterest enemies that christianity has ever had to do them justice they were destroyed by weapons which they had themselves supplied the intelligence which they had developed and sharpened turned inevitably against the incurable faults in their own system they were admirable teachers of mathematics condorcet instructed by the jesuits at rheims was able when he was only fifteen years old to go through such performances in analysis as to win especial applause from illustrious judges like d alembert and clairaut it was impossible however for jesuits as it has ever been for all enemies of movement to constrain within prescribed limits the activity which has once been effectively stirred mathematics has always been in the eyes of the church a harmless branch of knowledge but the mental energy that mathematics first touched is sure to turn itself by and by to more complex and dangerous subjects in the scientific hierarchy at any rate condorcet s curiosity was very speedily drawn to problems beyond those which geometry and algebra pretend to solve for thirty years he wrote in i have hardly ever passed a single day without meditating on the political sciences thus when only seventeen when the ardour of even the choicest spirits is usually most purely intellectual moral and social feeling was rising in condorcet to that supremacy which it afterwards attained in him to so admirable a degree he wrote essays on integral calculus but he was already beginning to reflect upon the laws of human societies and the conditions of moral obligation at the root of condorcet s nature was a profound sensibility of constitution one of his biographers explains his early enthusiasm for virtue and human welfare as the conclusion of a kind of syllogism it is possible that the syllogism was only the later shape into which an instinctive impulse threw itself by way of rational entrenchment his sensibility caused condorcet to abandon the barbarous pleasures of the chase which had at first powerfully attracted him to derive delight from what inflicts pain on any sentient creature revolted his conscience and offended his reason because he perceived that the character which does not shrink from associating its own joy with the anguish of another is either found or left mortally blunted to the finest impressions of humanity it is thus assured that from the beginning condorcet was unable to satisfy himself with the mere knowledge of the specialist but felt the necessity of placing social aims at the head and front of his life and of subordinating to them all other pursuits that he values knowledge only as a means to social action is one of the highest titles to our esteem that any philosopher can have such a temper of mind has penetrated no man more fully than condorcet though there are other

devoted to the children but had old fashioned scottish ideas of discipline their home was near barnstaple a lonely house in a garden shut in by high stone walls with meadows beyond the three children had no companions and were thrown on their own resources for amusement one of their diversions was to produce a newspaper all through his childhood hector professed violent tory opinions and at a very early age he began to take an interest in politics and to read any books or papers dealing with them that came his way he loved above all the woodlands and the wild things in them especially the birds his delicate health caused his aunts somewhat to temper their severity in his case but i fancy they must have had some difficulty in curbing his high spirits for he was a thoroughly human boy and up to every sort of prank he was sent for a time to a private school at exmouth and when he left it did lessons at home with his sister x x s governess later he was sent to bedford college when school days were over and colonel munro had returned to england for good hector and his sister were taken abroad by their father they lived in normandy and then in dresden where the first german words that hector learnt were the names of birds sometimes picked up from strangers in the zoological gardens then came a strenuous series of visits to german and austrian cities which colonel munro arranged as much for the education as the pleasure of his son and daughter museums and picture galleries were visited everywhere hector amused himself by counting up the number of st sebastians in each gallery and making bets with his sister as to which would have the most berlin won with eighteen the impression made on munro by this tour is to be seen in his books and in the present volume there are two tales the interlopers and the wolves of cernogratz which seem to have been inspired by the memory of some romantic castle in the heart of europe a short play karl ludwig x x s window which will be published later is based on an idea given by a visit to a castle near prague after a long visit to davos colonel munro returned with his family to england and settled in north devon where he devoted himself during the next two years to directing the studies of his son and daughter then came another long visit to davos after which hector left england and joined the burmese mounted police he once told me of the feeling of loneliness he experienced when he first arrived in burmah using almost the same words in which he described bassington x x s sense of isolation in the colony to which he was sent that account of the young englishman looking enviously at a native boy and girl racing wildly along in the joy of youth and companionship is one of the rare instances of autobiography in munro x x s works he was unable to support the burmese climate and after having fever seven times in eleven months was forced to return to england he remained at home for a year and hunted regularly with his sister during the winter he then came to london with the intention of making a literary career for himself his talent was recognised by sir francis gould to whom a friend had given him an introduction and he soon began to write for the westminster gazette two years after he settled in london the publication of the political satires based on alice in wonderland brought him into prominence as a wit and a writer to be counted with mr balfour was his chief butt in these pieces he was still as he always remained a conservative but he held at the time that mr balfour x x s leadership was a weakness to the party in munro went to the balkans for the morning post and later he became the correspondent of that paper in st petersburg where he was during the revolution of he left st petersburg to represent the morning post in paris and returned to london in where the agreeable life of a man of letters with a brilliant reputation awaited him he had a lodging in mortimer street and lived exceedingly simply it was his custom to pass the morning in a dressing gown writing his writing pad was usually propped up with a book to make it slant and he wrote slowly in a very clear hand rarely erasing a word or making a correction his air and the movement of his hand gave one the impression that he was drawing and not writing he almost always lunched at a lyons bread shop partly because it was economical and partly because as he said he got exactly the sort of luncheon he liked he cared nothing for money he had to earn his living but he was content as long as he had enough money to supply his needs when a friend once suggested a profitable field for his writings he dismissed the idea by saying that he was not interested in the public for which it was proposed that he should write he loved his art and by refusing to adopt a style that might have appealed to wider circles he made himself a place in our literature which in the opinion of many will be lasting almost every day he played cards either in the late afternoon or in the evening at the cocoa tree club the sight of the wealth of others did not excite his envy i remember his coming home from a ball and relating that he had sat at supper next a millionairess whose doctor had prescribed a diet of milk puddings x x ci had a hearty supper x x d he said gleefully x x cand for all her millions she was unable to eat anything x x d munro was exceedingly generous he would share his last sovereign with a friend and nothing pleased him better than to entertain his friends at dinner in a club or restaurant nothing

ordered all things for the best who could be appealed to for comfort for help might it not be as good an explanation as any other of the mystery surrounding us it had been so universal she was not

that somewhere in the world there is water might not the success of christianity in responding to human needs be evidence in its favour the love of god the fellowship of the holy ghost the grace of our lord jesus christ were not all human needs provided for in that one comprehensive promise the desperate need of man to be convinced that behind all the seeming muddle was a loving hand guiding

to say it of any of the great individualist novelists of the victorian time dickens saw far enough ahead to know that the time was coming when the people would be imploring the state to save them from mere freedom as from some frightful foreign oppressor he felt the society changing and thackeray never did as talking about socialism and individualism is one of the greatest bores ever endured among men i will take another instance to illustrate my meaning even though the instance be a queer and even a delicate one even if the reader does not agree with my deduction i ask his attention to the fact itself which i think a curiosity of literature in the last important work of dickens that excellent book our mutual friend there is an odd thing about which i cannot make up my mind i do not know whether it is unconscious observation or fiendish irony but it is this in our mutual friend is an old patriarch named aaron who is a saintly jew made to do the dirty work of an abominable christian usurer in an artistic sense i think the patriarch aaron as much of a humbug as the patriarch casby in a moral sense there is no doubt at all that dickens introduced the jew with a philanthropic idea of doing justice to judaism which he was told he had affronted by the great gargoyle of fagin if this was his motive it was morally a most worthy one but it is certainly unfortunate for the hebrew cause that the bad jew should be so very much more convincing than the good one old aaron is not an exaggeration of jewish virtues he is simply not jewish because he is not human there is nothing about him that in any way suggests the nobler sort of jew such a man as spinoza or mr zangwill he is simply a public apology and like most public apologies he is very stiff and not very convincing so far so good now we come to the funny part to describe the high visionary and mystic jew like spinoza or zangwill is a great and delicate task in which even dickens might have failed but most of us know something of the make and manners of the low jew who is generally the successful one most of us know the jew who calls himself de valancourt now to any one who knows a low jew by sight or hearing the story called our mutual friend is literally full of jews like all dickens s best characters they are vivid we know them and we know them to be hebrew mr veneering the man from nowhere dark sphinx like smiling with black curling hair and a taste in florid vulgar furniture of what stock was he mr lammle with too much nose in his face too much ginger in his whiskers too much sparkle in his studs and manners of what blood was he mr lammle s friends coarse and thick lipped with fingers so covered with rings that they could hardly hold their gold pencils do they remind us of anybody mr fledgeby with his little ugly eyes and social flashiness and craven bodily servility might not some fanatic like m drumont make interesting conjectures about him the particular types that people hate in jewry the types that are the shame of all good jews absolutely run riot in this book which is supposed to contain an apology to them it looks at first sight as if dickens s apology were one hideous sneer it looks as if he put in one good jew whom nobody could believe in and then balanced him with ten bad jews whom nobody could fail to recognise it seems as if he had avenged himself for the doubt about fagin by introducing five or six fagins triumphant fagins fashionable fagins fagins who had changed their names the impeccable old aaron stands up in the middle of this ironic carnival with a peculiar solemnity and silliness he looks like one particularly stupid englishman pretending to be a jew amidst all that crowd of clever jews who are pretending to be englishmen but this notion of a sneer is not admissible dickens was far too frank and generous a writer to employ such an elaborate plot of silence his satire was always intended to attack never to entrap moreover he was far too vain a man not to wish the crowd to see all his jokes vanity is more divine than pride because it is more democratic than pride third and most important dickens was a good liberal and would have been horrified at the notion of making so venomous a vendetta against one race or creed nevertheless the fact is there as i say if only as a curiosity of literature i defy any man to read through our mutual friend after hearing this suggestion and to get out of his head the conviction that lammle is the wrong kind of jew the explanation lies i think in this that dickens was so wonderfully sensitive to that change that has come over our society that he noticed the type of the oriental and cosmopolitan financier without even knowing that it was oriental or cosmopolitan he had in fact fallen a victim to a very simple fallacy affecting this problem somebody said with great wit and truth that treason cannot prosper because when it prospers it cannot be called treason the same argument soothed

ancient priestly garments their green faded look for the red handkerchief blackened as it always was with the snuff stains of a week with which he tried to brush away the fallen grains was quite inefficacious i wished to go in and look at him but i had not the courage to knock i walked away slowly along the sunny side of the street reading all the theatrical advertisements in the shopwindows as i went i found it strange that neither i nor the day seemed in a mourning mood and i felt even annoyed at discovering in myself a sensation of freedom as if i had been freed from something by his death i wondered at this for as my uncle had said the night before he had taught me a great deal he had studied in the irish college in rome and he had taught me to pronounce latin properly he had told me stories about the catacombs and about napoleon bonaparte and he had explained to me the meaning of the different ceremonies of the mass and of the different vestments worn by the priest sometimes he had amused himself by putting difficult questions to me asking me what one should do in certain circumstances or whether such and such sins were mortal or venial or only imperfections his questions showed me how complex and mysterious were certain institutions of the church which i had always regarded as the simplest acts the duties of the priest towards the eucharist and towards the secrecy of the confessional seemed so grave to me that i wondered how anybody had ever found in himself the courage to undertake them and i was not surprised when he told me that the fathers of the church had written books as thick as the post office directory and as closely printed as the law notices in the newspaper elucidating all these intricate questions often when i thought of this i could make no answer or only a very foolish and halting one upon which he used to smile and nod his head twice or thrice sometimes he used to put me through the responses of the mass which he had made me learn by heart and as i pattered he used to smile pensively and nod his head now and then pushing huge pinches of snuff up each nostril alternately when he smiled he used to uncover his big discoloured teeth and let his tongue lie upon his lower lip a habit which had made me feel uneasy in the beginning of our acquaintance before i knew him well as i walked along in the sun i remembered old cotter s words and tried to remember what had happened afterwards in the dream i remembered that i had noticed long velvet curtains and a swinging lamp of antique fashion i felt that i had been very far away in some land where the customs were strange in persia i thought but i could not remember the end of the dream in the evening my aunt took me with her to visit the house of mourning it was after sunset but the window panes of the houses that looked to the west reflected the tawny gold of a great bank of clouds nannie received us in the hall and as it would have been unseemly to have shouted at her my aunt shook hands with her for all the old woman pointed upwards interrogatively and on my aunt s nodding proceeded to toil up the narrow staircase before us her bowed head being scarcely above the level of the banister rail at the first landing she stopped and beckoned us forward encouragingly towards the open door of the dead room my aunt went in and the old woman seeing that i hesitated to enter began to beckon to me again repeatedly with her hand i went in on tiptoe the room through the lace end of the blind was suffused with dusky golden light amid which the candles looked like pale thin flames he had been coffined nannie gave the lead and we three knelt down at the foot of the bed i pretended to pray but i could not gather my thoughts because the old woman s mutterings distracted me i noticed how clumsily her skirt was hooked at the back and how the heels of her cloth boots were trodden down all to one side the fancy came to me that the old priest was smiling as he lay there in his coffin but no when we rose and went up to the head of the bed i saw that he was not smiling there he lay solemn and copious vested as for the altar his large hands loosely retaining a chalice his face was very truculent grey and massive with black cavernous nostrils and circled by a scanty white fur there was a heavy odour in the room the flowers we blessed ourselves and came away in the little room downstairs we found eliza seated in his arm chair in state i groped my way towards my usual chair in the corner while nannie went to the sideboard and brought out a decanter of sherry and some wine glasses she set these on the table and invited us to take a little glass of wine then at her sister s bidding she filled out the sherry into the glasses and passed them to us she pressed me to take some cream crackers also but i declined because i thought i would make too much noise eating them she seemed to be somewhat disappointed at my refusal and went over quietly to the sofa where she sat down behind her sister no one spoke we all gazed at the empty fireplace my aunt waited until eliza sighed and then said ah well he s gone to a better world eliza sighed again and bowed her head in assent my aunt fingered the stem of her wine glass before sipping a little did he peacefully she asked oh quite peacefully ma am said eliza you couldn t tell

so exalted that it is not likely that there was anyone in the world who was of a higher strain sidenote of king ban and his misfortunes now upon a certain time king ban of benwick fell into great

trible with intent to take that strong fortress and destroy it this noble castle of trible was the chiefest and the strongest place of defence in all king ban s dominions wherefore he had intrenched himself there with all of his knights and with his queen hight helen and his youngest son hight launcelot now this child launcelot was dearer to queen helen than all the world besides for he was not

presented to me with a dazzling assurance i didn t consider certainly that i was so forming my mind and was doubtless curious to see whether it mightn t by a process flourishing in other applications get to some extent formed it wasn t i think till i felt the rapture of that method s arrest that i knew how grotesquely little it had done for me and yet i bore it afterwards no malice resorting again to that early fatalistic philosophy of which the general sense was that almost anything however disagreeable had been worth while so unable was i to claim that it hadn t involved impressions i positively felt the impressional harvest rather rich little as any item of it might have passed at the time for the sort of thing one exhibits as a trophy of learning my small exhibition was all for myself and consisted on the whole but of a dusty spotty ugly picture i took it for ugly well nigh to the pitch of the sinister its being a picture at all and i clung to that came from the personal and material facts of the place where i was the only scholar of english speech since my companions with a genevese predominance were variously polyglot they wondered i couldn t doubt what i was doing among them and what lost lamb almost audibly bleating i had been charged to figure yet i remember no crude chaff no very free relation of any one with any one no high pitch still less any low descent of young pleasantry or irony our manners must have been remarkably formed and our general tone was that of a man of the world discretion or at the worst of a certain small bourgeois circumspection the dread in the genevese of having definitely to know strangers and thereby be at costs for any sort of hospitality to them comes back to me as written clear not less than their being of two sorts or societies sons of the townspeople pure and simple and sons of the local aristocracy perched in certain of the fine old houses of the cit and enjoying a background of sturdily seated lakeside villas and deeply umbrageous campagnes i remember thinking the difference of type complexion and general allure between these groups more marked to all the senses than any social distinction i had yet encountered but the great thing was that i could so simplify our enclosing scene itself round it in and make it compose the dark the dreary institution squeezed into a tall dim stony faced and stony hearted house at the very top of the cit and directly in the rear of the cathedral portions of the apse of which seem to me to have straggled above or protruded toward it with other odd extraneous masses than itself pressing still nearer this simplification quite luxuriously for my young mind was to mere mean blackness of an old world sordid order i recognised rich blackness in other connections but this was somehow of a harsh tradition and a tragic economy sordid and strong was what i had from the first felt the place though urging myself always to rub off history from its stones and suffering thus after a fashion by the fact that with history it ought to be interesting and that i ought to know just how and why it was for that i think was ever both the burden and the joy the complication i mean of interest and the sense in the midst of the ugly and the melancholy that queer crooked silent corners behind cathedrals wrought in their way for one did something while one haunted them to the imagination and the taste and that so once more since the generalisation had become a habit with me i couldn t seeing and feeling these things really believe i had picked up nothing when i sat in a dusky upper chamber and read french literature with blighted m toeppfer son of a happier sire as i was sure the charming writer and caricaturist in spite of cumbrous cares must have been or when a couple of times a week and in the same eternal twilight we groped almost lampless through the winter days and our glimmering tapers when they sparsely appeared smelt of a past age

such work as he has done for harper should have had as little in common as possible with midland english scenery he has been less a producer in black and white than a promoter and as i may say a protector of such production in others but none the less the back volumes of harper testify to the activity of his pencil as well as to the variety of his interests there was a time when he drew little else but cossacks and orientals and drew them as one who had good cause to be vivid of the young generation he was the first to know the russian plastically especially the russian soldier and he had paid heavily for his acquaintance during the russo turkish war he was correspondent in the field with the victors of the new york herald and the london daily news a capacity in which he made many out of the way many precious observations he has seen strange countries the east and the south and the west and the north and practised many arts to the london graphic in he sent striking sketches from the east as well as capital prose to the journals i have mentioned he has always been as capable of writing a text for his own sketches as of making sketches for the text of others he has made pictures without words and words without pictures he has written some very clever ghost stories and drawn and painted some very immediate realities he has lately given himself up to these latter objects and discovered that they have mysteries more absorbing than any others i find in harper in a wild goose chase through north germany and denmark in which both pencil and pen are mr millet s and both show the natural and the trained observer he knows the art schools of the continent the studios of paris the dodges of antwerp the subjects the models of venice and has had much sthetic as well as much personal experience he has draped and distributed greek plays at harvard as well as ridden over balkans to post pressing letters and given publicity to english villages in which susceptible americans may get the strongest sensations with the least trouble to themselves if the trouble in each case will have been largely his this is but congruous with the fact that he has not only found time to have a great deal of history himself but has suffered himself to be converted by others into an element beneficent i should call it if discretion did not forbid me of their history springing from a very old new england stock he has found the practice of art a wonderful antidote in his own language for belated puritanism he is very modern in the sense of having tried many things and availed himself of all of the facilities of his time but especially on this ground of having fought out for himself the battle of the puritan habit and the sthetic experiment his experiment was admirably successful from the moment that the puritan levity was forced to consent to its becoming a serious one in other words if mr millet is artistically interesting to day and to the author of these remarks he is highly so it is because he is a striking example of what the typical american quality can achieve he began by having an excellent pencil because as a thoroughly practical man he could not possibly have had a weak one but nothing is more remunerative to follow than the stages by which faculty in general which is what i mean by the characteristic american quality has become the particular faculty so that if in the artist s present work one recognizes recognizes even fondly the national handiness it is as handiness regenerate and transfigured the american adaptiveness has become a dutch finish the only criticism i have to make is of the preordained paucity of mr millet s drawings for my mission is not to speak of his work in oils every year more important as was

or they may have remained in ohio and begun slowly to take on some faint likeness of civilization there is nothing to prove that they went and there is nothing to prove that they staid but ohio must always have been a pleasant place to live in after the great thaw and it seems reasonable to think that the ice folk lingered in part at least and changed with the changing climate and became at last the people who left the signs of their presence in almost every part of the state those were the mound builders whose works are said to be two or three thousand years old though we cannot be very sure of that there are some who think that the mounds are only a few hundred years old and that their builders were the race of red men whom the white men found here one may think very much as one likes and i like to think that the mound builders were a very ancient people who vanished many ages before the indians came here they could not have been savages for the region where they dwelt could not have fed savages enough to heap up the multitude of their mounds each wild man needs fifty thousand acres to live upon as the wild man lives by hunting and fishing in the whole ohio country the earliest white adventurers found only two or three thousand indians at the most and the people who built those forts and temples and tombs and shaped from the earth the mighty images of their strange bird gods and reptile gods could have lived only by tilling the soil their mounds are found everywhere in the west between the alleghany mountains and the mississippi river but they are found mostly in ohio where their farms and gardens once bordered the muskingum the scioto the two miamis and our other large streams which they probably used as highways to the rivers of the southwest their forts were earthworks but they were skillfully planned with a knowledge which no savage race has shown they were real strongholds and they are so large that some of them inclose hundreds of acres within walls of earth which still rise ten and twelve feet from the ground they are on a far grander scale than the supposed temples or religious works and there are more of them than of all the other ruins except the small detached mounds which are almost numberless these from the charred bones found among the ashes in them are known to be tombs and they were probably the sepulchers of the common people whose bodies were burned the large mounds are heaped above walled chambers and in these were platforms supposed to have been altars and whole skeletons supposed to be the skeletons of priests buried there the priests are supposed to have been the chiefs of the people and to have ruled them through their superstitions but there is nothing to prove this for their laws were never put in written words or any other sign of speech in some of the mounds little figures of burnt clay have been found which may be idols and pieces of ancient pottery which may be fragments of sacred vessels and small plates of copper with marks or scratches on them which may be letters some antiquarians have tried to read these letters if they are letters and to make sense out of them but no seeker after true ohio stories can trust their interpretations the mound builders used very little stone and showed no knowledge of masonry but they built so massively out of the earth that their works have lasted to this day in many places just as they left them except for the heavy growth of trees which the first settlers found covering them and which were sometimes seven or eight hundred years old at marietta these works when the white people came were quite perfect and inclosed fifty acres on the bank of the muskingum overlooking the ohio they were in great variety of design the largest mound was included in the grounds of the present cemetery and so has been saved but the plow of the new england emigrant soon passed over the foundations of the mound builders temples at circleville the shape of their fortifications gave its name to the town which has long since hid them from sight one of them was almost perfectly round and the other nearly square the round fort was about seventy feet in diameter and was formed of two walls twenty feet high with a deep ditch between the other fort was fifty five rods square and it had no ditch seven gateways opened into it at the side and corners and it was joined to the round fort by an eighth it is forever to be regretted that these precious ancient works should have been destroyed to make place for the present town but within a few years one of the most marvelous of the mound builders works the great serpent mound near loudon in adams county has been preserved to after time by the friends of science and put in the keeping of the peabody museum at harvard university

to his left eye and leaned forward then he shook his head he was a little too far away no it is a short name seems to begin with s probably a son of israel his taste in flowers is at any rate irreproachable wolfenden remarked i wish they would come i am in a genial mood and i do not like to think of any one having to hurry over such an excellent supper the lady densham suggested is probably theatrical and has to dress after the show half past twelve is a barbarous hour to turn us out i wonder sh sh the slight exclamation and a meaning frown from wolfenden checked his speech he broke off in the middle of his sentence and looked round there was the soft swish of silk passing his chair and the faint suggestion of a delicate and perfectly strange perfume at last the table was being taken possession of a girl in a wonderful white dress was standing there leaning over to admire the great bunch of creamy white blossoms whilst a waiter respectfully held a chair for her a few steps behind came her companion an elderly man who walked with a slight limp leaning heavily upon a stick she turned to him and made some remark in french pointing to the flowers he smiled and passing her stood for a moment leaning slightly upon the back of his chair waiting with a courtesy which was obviously instinctive until she should have seated herself during the few seconds which elapsed before they were settled in their places he glanced around the room with a smile slightly cynical but still good natured parting his thin well shaped lips wolfenden and densham who were looking at him with frank curiosity he glanced at carelessly the third young man of the party felix was bending low over his plate and his face was hidden the buzz of conversation in their immediate vicinity had been temporarily suspended every one who had seen them enter had been interested in these late comers and many curious eyes had followed them to their seats briefly the girl was beautiful and the man distinguished when they had taken their places however the hum of conversation recommenced densham and wolfenden leaned over to one another and their questions were almost simultaneous who are they who is she alas neither of them knew neither of them had the least idea felix wolfenden s guest it seemed useless to ask he had only just arrived in england and he was a complete stranger to london besides he did not seem to be interested he was proceeding calmly with his supper with his back directly turned upon the new comers beyond one rapid upward glance at their entrance he seemed almost to have avoided looking at them wolfenden thought of this afterwards i see harcutt in the corner he said he will know who they are for certain i shall go and ask him he crossed the room and chatted for a few minutes with a noisy little party in an adjacent recess presently he put his question alas not one of them knew harcutt a journalist of some note and a man who prided himself upon knowing absolutely everybody was as helpless as the rest to his humiliation he was obliged to confess it i never saw either of them before in my life he said i cannot imagine who they can be they are certainly foreigners very likely wolfenden agreed quietly in fact i never doubted it an english girl of that age she is very young by the bye would never be so perfectly turned out what a very horrid thing to say lord wolfenden exclaimed the woman on whose chair his hand was resting don t you know that dressing is altogether a matter of one s maid you may rely upon it that that girl has found a treasure well i don t know wolfenden said smiling young english girls always seem to me to look so dishevelled in evening dress now this girl is dressed with the art of a frenchwoman of mature years and yet with the simplicity of a child the woman laid down her lorgnettes and shrugged her shoulders i agree with you she said that she is probably not english if she were she would not wear such diamonds at her age by the bye harcutt remarked with sudden cheerfulness we shall be able to find out who the man is when we leave the table was reserved so the name will be on the list at the door his friends rose to leave and harcutt making his adieux crossed the room with wolfenden we may as well have our coffee together he said i ordered turkish and i ve been waiting for it ten minutes we got here early hullo where s your other guest densham was sitting alone wolfenden looked at him inquiringly your friend felix has gone he announced suddenly remembered an engagement with his chief and begged you to excuse him said he d look you up to morrow well he s an odd fellow wolfenden remarked motioning harcutt to the vacant place his looks certainly belie his name he s not exactly a cheerful companion for a supper party densham admitted but i like his face how did you come across him wolfenden and where does he hail from he s a junior attach at the russian embassy wolfenden said stirring his coffee only just been appointed charlie meynell gave him a line of introduction to me said he was a decent sort but mopish i looked him up last week met him in pall mall just as you came along and asked you both to supper what liqueurs harcutt the conversation drifted into ordinary channels and flowed on steadily at the same time it was maintained with a certain amount of difficulty the advent of these two people at the next table had produced an extraordinary effect upon the three men harcutt was perhaps the least affected he was a young man of fortune and natural gifts who had embraced journalism as a career and was really in love with his profession

half clad candle in hand upon the threshold david followed the marquis out of the carriage assist the lady he was ordered the poet obeyed he felt her small hand tremble as he guided her descent into the house was the next command the room was the long dining hall of the tavern a great oak table ran down its length the huge gentleman seated himself in a chair at the nearer end the lady sank into another against the wall with an air of great weariness david stood considering how best he might now take his leave and continue upon his way my lord said the landlord bowing to the floor h had i ex expected this honour entertainment would have been ready t t there is wine and cold fowl and m m maybe candles said the marquis spreading the fingers of one plump white hand in a gesture he had y yes my lord he fetched half a dozen candles lighted them and set them upon the table if monsieur would perhaps deign to taste a certain burgundy there is a cask candles said monsieur spreading his fingers assuredly quickly i fly my lord a dozen more lighted candles shone in the hall the great bulk of the marquis overflowed his chair he was dressed in fine black from head to foot save for the snowy ruffles at his wrist and throat even the hilt and scabbard of his sword were black his expression was one of sneering pride the ends of an upturned moustache reached nearly to his mocking eyes the lady sat motionless and now david perceived that she was young and possessed of pathetic and appealing beauty he was startled from the contemplation of her forlorn loveliness by the booming voice of the marquis what is your name and pursuit david mignot i am a poet the moustache of the marquis curled nearer to his eyes how do you live i am also a shepherd i guarded my father s flock david answered with his head high but a flush upon his cheek then listen master shepherd and poet to the fortune you have blundered upon to night this lady is my niece mademoiselle lucie de varennes she is of noble descent and is possessed of ten thousand francs a year in her own right as to her charms you have but to observe for yourself if the inventory pleases your shepherd s heart she becomes your wife at a word do not interrupt me to night i conveyed her to the ch teau of the comte de villemaur to whom her hand had been promised guests were present the priest was waiting her marriage to one eligible in rank and fortune was ready to be accomplished at the alter this demoiselle so meek and dutiful turned upon me like a leopardess charged me with cruelty and crimes and broke before the gaping priest the troth i had plighted for her i swore there and then by ten thousand devils that she should marry the first man we met after leaving the ch teau be he prince charcoal burner or thief you shepherd are the first mademoiselle must be wed this night if not you then another you have ten minutes in which to make your decision do not vex me with words or questions ten minutes shepherd and they are speeding the marquis drummed loudly with his white fingers upon the table he sank into a veiled attitude of waiting it was as if some great house had shut its doors and windows against approach david would have spoken but the huge man s bearing stopped his tongue instead he stood by the lady s chair and bowed mademoiselle he said and he marvelled to find his words flowing easily before so much elegance and beauty you have heard me say i was a shepherd i have also had the fancy at times that i am a poet if it be the test of a poet to adore and cherish the beautiful that fancy is now strengthened can i serve you in any way mademoiselle the young woman looked up at him with eyes dry and mournful his frank glowing face made serious by the gravity of the adventure his strong straight figure and the liquid sympathy in his blue eyes perhaps also her imminent need of long denied help and kindness thawed her to sudden tears monsieur she said in low tones you look to be true and kind he is my uncle the brother of my father and my only relative he loved my mother and he hates me because i am like her he has made my life one long terror i am afraid of his very looks and never before dared to disobey him but to night he would have married me to a man three times my age you will forgive me for bringing this vexation upon you monsieur you will of course decline this mad act he tries to force upon you but let me thank you for your generous words at least i have had none spoken to me in so long there was now something more than generosity in the poet s eyes poet he must have been for yvonne was forgotten this fine new loveliness held him with its freshness and grace the subtle perfume from her filled him with strange emotions his tender look fell warmly upon her she leaned to it thirstily ten minutes said david is given me in which to do what i would devote years to achieve i will not say i pity you mademoiselle it would not be true i love you i cannot ask love from you yet but let me rescue you from this cruel man and in time love may come i think i have a future i will not always be a shepherd for the present i will cherish you with all my heart and make your life less sad will you trust your fate to me mademoiselle ah you would sacrifice yourself from pity from love the time is almost up mademoiselle you will regret it and despise me i will live only to make you happy and myself worthy of you her fine small hand crept into his from beneath her cloak i will trust you she breathed with my life and and love may not be so far off as you think

him as ridiculous to confess his troubles to a little sister even if her reports were higher than his and the little sister struck him as ridiculous to demand his troubles of him what a soft cheek she has he thought as she pressed her face gently against his hand if he could but tear himself away it was all so foolish only he might hurt her feelings and in his experience girls feelings were very easily hurt she opened his fingers and kissed the palm of his hand it was like a rose leaf falling it was also her way of asking her question over again nothing s the matter he said decisively and then quite inconsistently he blurted out father his worry was now in her eyes but father is so good and kind joe she began why don t you try to please him he does n t ask much of you and it s all for

nothing said sophie her short skirt hooked by briers i thought all england was a garden there s your spire george across the valley how curious they walked toward it through an all abandoned land here they found the ghost of a patch of lucerne that had refused to die there a harsh fallow surrendered to yard high thistles and here a breadth of rampant kelk feigning to be lawful crop in the ungrazed pastures swaths of dead stuff caught their feet and the ground beneath glistened with sweat at the bottom of the valley a little brook had undermined its footbridge and frothed in the wreckage but there stood great woods on the slopes beyond old tall and brilliant like unfaded tapestries against the walls of a ruined house all this within a hundred miles of london he said looks as if it had had nervous prostration too the footpath turned the shoulder of a slope through a thicket of rank rhododendrons and crossed what had once been a carriage drive which ended in the shadow of two gigantic holm oaks a house said sophie in a whisper a colonial house behind the blue green of the twin trees rose a dark bluish brick georgian pile with a shell shaped fan light over its pillared door the hound had gone off on his own foolish quests except for some stir it the branches and the flight of four startled magpies there was neither life nor sound about the square house but it looked out of its long windows most friendlily cha armed to meet you i m sure said sophie and curtsied to the ground george this is history i can understand we began here she curtsied again the june sunshine twinkled on all the lights it was as though an old lady wise in three generations experience but for the present sitting out bent to listen to her flushed and eager grandchild i must look sophie tiptoed to a window and shaded her eyes with her hand oh this room s half full of cotton bales wool i suppose but i can see a bit of the mantelpiece george do come isn t that some one she fell back behind her husband the front door opened slowly to show the hound his nose white with milk in charge of an ancient of days clad in a blue linen ephod curiously gathered on breast and shoulders certainly said george half aloud father time himself this is where he lives sophie we came said sophie weakly can we see the house i m afraid that s our dog no tis rambler said the old man he s been at my swill pail again staying at rocketts be ye come in ah you runagate the hound broke from him and he tottered after him down the drive they entered the hall just such a high light hall as such a house should own a slim balustered staircase wide and shallow and once creamy white climbed out of it under a long oval window on either side delicately moulded doors gave on to wool lumbered rooms whose sea green mantelpieces were adorned with nymphs scrolls and cupids in low relief what s the firm that makes these things cried sophie enraptured oh i forgot these must be the originals adams is it i never dreamed of anything like that steel cut fender does he mean us to go everywhere he s catching the dog said george looking out we don t count they explored the first or ground floor delighted as children playing burglars this is like all england she said at last wonderful but no explanation you re expected to know it beforehand now let s try upstairs the stairs never creaked beneath their feet from the broad landing they entered a long green panelled room lighted by three full length windows which overlooked the forlorn wreck of a terraced garden and wooded slopes beyond the drawing room of course sophie swam up and down it that mantelpiece orpheus and eurydice is the best of them all isn t it marvellous why the room seems furnished with nothing in it how s that george it s the proportions i ve noticed it i saw a heppelwhite couch once sophie laid her finger to her flushed cheek and considered with two of them one on each side you wouldn t need anything else

gave back of my face it was skin and hair thickly encrusted with clay and rootlets having taken a long drink i threw off my clothes to have a bath and after splashing about for half an hour managed to rid my skin of its accumulations of dirt while drying in the wind i shook the loose sand and clay from my garments then dressed and feeling greatly refreshed proceeded on my walk for an hour or so i followed the valley in its many windings but failing to see any dwelling place i ascended a hill to get a view of the surrounding country the prospect which disclosed itself when i had got a couple of hundred feet above the surrounding level appeared unfamiliar the hills among which i had been wandering were now behind me before me spread a wide rolling country beyond which rose a mountain range resembling in the distance blue banked up clouds with summits and peaks of pearly whiteness looking on this scene i could hardly refrain from shouting with joy so glad did the sunlit expanse of earth and the pure exhilarating mountain breeze make me feel the season was late summer that was plain to see the ground was moist as if from recent showers and the earth everywhere had that intense living greenness with which it reclothes itself when the greater heats are over but the foliage of the woods was already beginning to be touched here and there with the yellow and russet hues of decay a more tranquil and soul satisfying scene could not be imagined the dear old mother earth was looking her very best while the shifting golden sunlight the mysterious haze in the distance and the glint of a wide stream not very far off seemed to spiritualize her happy autumn fields and bring them into a closer kinship with the blue over arching sky there was one large house or mansion in sight but no town nor even a hamlet and not one solitary spire in vain i scanned the horizon waiting impatiently to see the distant puff of white steam from some passing engine this troubled me not a little for i had no idea that i had drifted so far from civilization in my search for specimens or whatever it was that brought me to this pretty primitive wilderness not quite a wilderness however for there within a short hour s walk of the hill stood the one great stone mansion close to the river i had mentioned there were also horses and cows in sight and a number of scattered sheep were grazing on the hillside beneath me strange to relate i met with a little misadventure on account of the sheep an animal which one is accustomed to regard as of a timid and inoffensive nature when i set out at a brisk pace to walk to the house i have spoken of in order to make some inquiries there a few of the sheep that happened to be near began to bleat loudly as if alarmed and by and by they came hurrying after me apparently in a great state of excitement i did not mind them much but presently a pair of horses attracted by their bleatings also seemed struck at my appearance and came at a swift gallop to within twenty yards of me they were magnificent looking brutes evidently a pair of well groomed carriage horses for their coats which were of a fine bronze color sparkled wonderfully in the sunshine in other respects they were very unlike carriage animals for they had tails reaching to the ground like funeral horses and immense black leonine manes which gave them a strikingly bold and somewhat formidable appearance for some moments they stood with heads erect gazing fixedly at me and then simultaneously delivered a snort of defiance or astonishment so loud and sudden that it startled me like the report of a gun this tremendous equine blast brought yet another enemy on the field in the shape of a huge milk white bull with long horns a very noble kind of animal but one which i always prefer to admire from behind a hedge or at a distance through a field glass fortunately his wrathful mutterings gave me timely notice of his approach and without waiting to discover his intentions i incontinently fled down the slope to the refuge of a grove or belt of trees clothing the lower portion of the hillside spent and panting from my run i embraced a big tree and turning to face the foe found that i had not been followed sheep horses and bull were all grouped together just where i had left them apparently holding a consultation or comparing notes the trees where i had sought shelter were old and grew here and there singly or in scattered groups it was a pretty wilderness of mingled tree shrub and flower i was surprised to find here some very large and ancient looking fig trees and numbers of wasps and flies were busy feeding on a few over ripe figs on the higher branches honey bees also roamed about everywhere extracting sweets from the autumn bloom and filling the sunny glades with a soft monotonous murmur of sound walking on full of happy thoughts and a keen sense of the sweetness of life pervading me i presently noticed that a multitude of small birds were gathering about me flitting through the trees overhead and the bushes on either hand but always keeping near me apparently as much excited at my presence as if i had been a gigantic owl or some such unnatural monster their increasing numbers and incessant excited chirping and chattering at first served to amuse but in the end began to irritate me i observed too that the alarm was spreading and that larger birds usually shy of men pigeons jays and magpies i fancied they were now began to make their appearance could it be thought i with some concern that i had wandered into some uninhabited wilderness to cause so great a commotion among the little feathered people i very soon dismissed this as an idle thought for one does not find houses domestic animals and fruit trees in

their attraction or aversion can often only be conveyed by stray examples or sudden images when danton was defending himself before the jacobin tribunal he spoke so loud that his voice was heard across the seine in quite remote streets on the other side of the river he must have bellowed like a bull of bashan yet none of us would think of that prodigy except as something poetical and appropriate none of us would instinctively feel that danton was less of a man or even less of a gentleman for speaking so in such an hour but suppose we heard that marie antoinette when tried before the same tribunal had howled so that she could be heard in the faubourg st germain mdash well i leave it to the instincts if there are any left it is not wrong to howl neither is it right it is simply a question of the instant impression on the artistic and even animal parts of humanity if the noise were heard suddenly like a gun perhaps the nearest verbal analysis of the instinct may be found in the gestures of the orator addressing a crowd for the true orator must always be a demagogue even if the mob be a small mob like the french committee or the english house of lords and demagogue in the good greek meaning does not mean one who pleases the populace but one who leads it and if you will notice you will see that all the instinctive gestures of oratory are gestures of military leadership pointing the people to a path or waving them on to an advance notice that long sweep of the arm across the body and outward which great orators use naturally and cheap orators artificially it is almost the exact gesture of the drawing of a sword the point is not that women are unworthy of votes it is not even that votes are unworthy of women it is that votes are unworthy of men so long as they are merely votes and have nothing in them of this ancient militarism of democracy the only crowd worth talking to is the crowd that is ready to go somewhere and do something the only demagogue worth hearing is he who can point at something to be done and if he points with a sword will only feel it familiar and useful like an elongated finger now except in some mystical exceptions which prove the rule these are not the gestures and therefore not the instincts of women no honest man dislikes the public woman he can only dislike the political woman an entirely different thing the instinct has nothing to do with any desire to keep women curtained or captive if such a desire exists a husband would be pleased if his wife wore a gold crown and proclaimed laws from a throne of marble or if she uttered oracles from the tripod of a priestess or if she could walk in mystical motherhood before the procession of some great religious order but that she should stand on a platform in the exact altitude in which he stands leaning forward a little more than is graceful and holding her mouth open a little longer and wider than is dignified mdash well i only write here of the facts of natural history and the fact is that it is this and not publicity or importance that hurts it is for the modern world to judge whether such instincts are indeed danger signals and whether the hurting of moral as of material nerves is a tocsin and a warning of nature the poet and the cheese there is something creepy in the flat eastern counties a brush of the white feather there is a

great level lands has a curiously still and lonely quality lonely even when there are plenty of people on the road and in the market place one s voice seems to break an almost elvish silence and something unreasonably weird in the phrase of the nursery tales and he went a little farther and came to another place comes back into the mind in some such mood i came along a lean pale road south of the fens and found myself in a large quiet and seemingly forgotten village it was one of those places that instantly produce a frame of mind which it may be one afterwards decks out with unreal details i dare say that grass did not really grow in the streets but i came away with a curious impression that it did i dare say the marketplace was not literally lonely and without sign of life but it left the vague impression of being so the place was large and even loose in design yet it had the air of something hidden away and always overlooked it seemed shy like a big yokel the low roofs seemed to be ducking behind the hedges and railings and the chimneys holding their breath i came into it in that dead hour of the afternoon which is neither after lunch nor before tea nor anything else even on a half holiday and i had a fantastic feeling that i had strayed into a lost and extra hour that is not numbered in the twenty four i entered an inn which stood openly in the market place yet was almost as private as a private house those who talk of public houses as if they were all one problem would have been both puzzled and pleased with such a place in the front window a stout old

was conscious of a glow of benevolence toward her species not excluding even the young couple she had almost reduced to mincemeat in the neighbourhood of ninety seventh street they had annoyed her extremely at the time of their meeting by occupying till the last possible moment a part of the road which she wanted herself on reaching sixty first street she found her way blocked by a lumbering

ran that only two minutes before he had almost robbed himself of this spectacle by going into a moving picture palace mrs porter was annoyed she had never run over anything before except a few chickens and she regarded the incident as a blot on her escutcheon she was incensed with this idiot who had flung himself before her car not reflecting in her heat that he probably had a pre natal

least of all in the presence of the opposite sex she had well defined views upon man yet in the interval which elapsed between the opening of the door and her first words a certain sensation of smallness overcame her the man who had opened the door was not judged by any standard of regularity of features handsome he had a rather boyish face pleasant eyes set wide apart and a friendly mouth he was rather an outsize in young men and as he stood there he seemed to fill the doorway it was this sense of bigness that he conveyed his cleanness his magnificent fitness that for the moment

eager to follow my lead there was applause somewhat more mild in character but none came forward alora s father jason jones who had already signed for fifty thousand dollars rose and added another twenty five thousand to that sum this act elicited another ripple of applause more questioning looks were exchanged between those assembled but there were no further offers to subscribe the hearts of the committeemen fell was this meeting on which they had so greatly depended destined to prove a failure after all jake kasker the owner of kasker s clothing emporium finally made his way to the platform and mounting the steps faced his townspeople there was a little murmur of surprise and a sudden tension the man had been distrusted in dorfield of late you all know what i think about this war said kasker in a loud voice and with a slight german accent i don t approve of it whatever anyone says and i think we were wrong to get into it anyhow a storm of hisses and cries of shame saluted him but he waited stolidly for the demonstration to subside then he continued but whatever i think about the war i want to tell you that this flag that now waves over my head is as much my flag as it is yours for i m an american citizen where that flag goes jake kasker will follow no matter what fools carry the standard if they don t think i m too old to go to france i ll pack up and go to morrow

but i ll take two thousand dollars worth of liberty bonds some one laughed jeeringly another shouted make it three thousand jake i will said kasker and if there ain t enough of you war crazy yellow

like a goose whenever you slackers pass my door there was more laughter a few angry shouts and a movement toward the platform the german signed the paper mr jaswell placed before him and withdrew soon

back a cynical grin upon his features thank you kasker said the old gentleman in a cold voice you have really helped us although you should have omitted those traitorous words they poisoned a deed you might have been proud of we don t agree colonel replied kasker with a shrug when i talk i m honest i say what i think he turned and walked away and colonel hathaway looked after him with an expression of dislike i wonder why he did it whispered mary louise who had overheard the exchange of words and marked kasker s dogged opposition he bought the bonds as a matter of business replied laura hilton

their party it was not fair to him to pretend that the atmosphere was a liberal and inquiring one when the young man who had sat still and dormant by the table was in reality a keen and bitter irish roman catholic then the question a question begging question was put quite suddenly without preparation or prelude by surprise why bishop was the spermaticos logos identified with the second and not the third person of the trinity it was indiscreet it was silly to turn upon the speaker and affect an air of disengagement and modernity and to say ah that indeed is the unfortunate aspect of the whole affair whereupon the fierce young man had exploded with to that is it that you anglicans have come the whole gathering had given itself up to the disputation lady sunderbund an actress a dancer though she it is true did not say very much a novelist a mechanical expert of some sort a railway peer geniuses hairy and celtic people of no clearly definable position but all quite unequal to the task of maintaining that air of reverent vagueness that tenderness of touch which is by all anglican standards imperative in so deep so mysterious and nowadays in mixed society at least so infrequent

all he suggested a reaction from a too manichaean dualism at some date after the time of st john s gospel he maintained obstinately that that gospel was dualistic the unpleasant quality of the talk was far more manifest in the retrospect than it had been at the time it had seemed then bold and strange but not impossible now in the cold darkness it seemed sacrilegious and the bishop s share which was indeed only the weak yielding of a tired man to an atmosphere he had misjudged became a disgraceful display of levity and bad faith they had baited him some one had said that nowadays every one was an arian knowingly or unknowingly they had not concealed their conviction that the bishop did not really believe in the creeds he uttered and that unfortunate first admission stuck terribly in his

above or below there must be a switch the switch was found grasped and turned the darkness fled in a mirror the sleeper saw the reflection of his face and a corner of the bed in which he lay the lamp

the anakim it had a canopy with yellow silk curtains surmounted by a gilded crown of carved wood between the curtains was a man s face clean shaven pale with disordered brown hair and weary pale blue

back of a gilt chair over which a garment of peculiar construction had been carelessly thrown it was in the form of that sleeveless cassock of purple opening at the side whose lower flap is called a bishop s apron the corner of the frogged coat showed behind the chair back and the sash lay crumpled on the floor black doeskin breeches still warmly lined with their pants lay where they had been

listening to the sweet singers of the smiling pool even after he had curled himself up for the night deep down in his snug bedroom he could hear those sweet voices and whenever he waked up in the night he would hear them spring spring spring spring beautiful beautiful beautiful spring so gentle so loving so sweet and so fair oh who can be cross when there s love in the air be happy be joyful and join in our song and help us to send the glad tidings along spring spring spring spring beautiful beautiful beautiful spring when johnny chuck had first heard them he had looked in all the tree tops for the singers but not one could he see then he had thought that they must be hidden in the bushes but when he went to look he found that the sweet singers were not there it was very mysterious finally he asked peter rabbit if he knew who the sweet singers were and where they were peter didn t know but he was willing to try to find out peter is always willing to try to find out about things he doesn t already know about so johnny chuck and peter rabbit started out to find the sweet singers i believe they are down in the old bulrushes around the smiling pool said peter rabbit as he stood listening with a hand behind one long ear so over to the smiling pool they hurried the nearer they got the louder became the voices singing spring spring spring spring beautiful beautiful beautiful spring but look as they would they couldn t see a single singer among the brown bulrushes it was very strange very strange indeed it seemed as if the voices came right out of the smiling pool itself when peter rabbit made a little noise as he hopped out on the bank where he could look all over the smiling pool the singing stopped after he had sat perfectly still for a little while it began again there was no doubt about it this time those voices came right out of the water johnny chuck stared at peter rabbit and peter stared at johnny chuck nobody was to be seen in the smiling pool and yet there were those voices oh so many of them coming right out of the water how can birds stay under water and still sing asked johnny chuck ho ho ho ha ha ha peter rabbit and johnny chuck whirled around to find jerry muskrat peeping up at them from a hole in the bank almost under their feet illustration ho ho ho that s the best joke this spring shouted jerry muskrat ho ho ho that s the best joke this

communism in fact i cannot see why the same salutary limitation should not be applied to all property rights whatsoever but a system which enables any alert sharper to acquire property rights in my stories as against myself and the rest of the community would it seems to me justify a rebellion if authors were numerous and warlike enough to make one it may be asked why i have written the admirable bashville in blank verse my answer is that i had but a week to write it in blank verse is so childishly easy and expeditious hence by the way shakespear s copious output that by adopting it i was enabled to do within the week what would have cost me a month in prose besides i am fond of blank verse not nineteenth century blank verse of course nor indeed with a very few exceptions any post shakespearean blank verse nay not shakespearean blank verse itself later than the histories when an author can write the prose dialogue of the first scene in as you like it or hamlet s colloquies with rosencrantz and guildenstern there is really no excuse for the seven ages and to be or not to be except the excuse of a haste that made great facility indispensable i am quite sure that any one who is to recover the charm of blank verse must frankly go back to its beginnings and start a literary pre raphaelite brotherhood i like the melodious sing song the clear simple one line and two line sayings and the occasional rhymed tags like the half closes in an eighteenth century symphony in peele kyd greene and the histories of shakespear how any one with music in him can turn from henry vi john and the two richards to such a mess of verse half developed into rhetorical prose as cymbeline is to me explicable only by the uncivil hypothesis that the artistic qualities in the elizabethan drama do not exist for most of its critics so that they hang on to its purely prosaic content and hypnotize themselves into absurd exaggerations of the value of that content even poets fall under the spell ben jonson described marlowe s line as mighty as well put michael angelo s epitaph on the tombstone of paolo uccello no wonder jonson s blank verse is the most horribly disagreeable product in literature and indicates his most prosaic mood as surely as his shorter rhymed measures indicate his poetic mood marlowe never wrote a mighty line in his life cowper s single phrase toll for the brave drowns all his mightinesses as great tom drowns a military band but marlowe took that very pleasant sounding rigmarole of peele and greene and added to its sunny daylight the insane splendors of night and the cheap tragedy of crime because he had only a common sort of brain he was hopelessly beaten by shakespear but he had a fine ear and a soaring spirit in short one does not forget wanton arethusa s azure arms and the like but the pleasant sounding rigmarole was the basis of the whole thing and as long as that rigmarole was practised frankly for the sake of its pleasantness it was readable and speakable it lasted until shakespear did to it what raphael did to italian painting that is overcharged and burst it by making it the vehicle of a new order of thought involving a mass of intellectual ferment and psychological research the rigmarole could not stand the strain and shakespear s style ended in a chaos of half shattered old forms half emancipated new ones with occasional bursts of prose eloquence on the one hand occasional delicious echoes of the rigmarole mostly from calibans and masque personages on the other with alas a great deal of filling up with formulary blank verse which had no purpose except to save the author s time and thought when a great man destroys an art form in this way its ruins make palaces for the clever would be great after michael angelo and raphael giulio romano and the carracci after marlowe and shakespear chapman and the police news poet webster webster s specialty was blood chapman s balderdash many of us by this time find it difficult to believe that pre ruskinite art criticism used to prostrate itself before the works of domenichino and guido and to patronize the modest little beginnings of those who came between cimabue and masaccio but we have only to look at our own current criticism of elizabethan drama to satisfy ourselves that in an art which has not yet found its ruskin or its pre raphaelite brotherhood the same folly is still academically propagated it is possible and even usual for men professing to have ears and a sense of poetry to snub peele and greene and grovel before fletcher and webster fletcher a facile blank verse penny a liner webster a turgid paper cut throat the subject is one which i really cannot pursue without intemperance of language the man who thinks the duchess of malfi better than david and bethsabe is outside the pale not merely of literature but almost of humanity yet some of the worst of these post shakespearean duffers from jonson to heywood suddenly became poets when they turned from the big drum of pseudo shakespearean drama to the pipe and tabor of the masque exactly as shakespear himself recovered the old charm of the rigmarole when he turned from prospero to ariel and caliban cyril tourneur and heywood could certainly have produced very pretty rigmarole plays if they had begun where shakespear began instead of trying to begin where he left off jonson and beaumont would very likely have done themselves credit on the same terms marston would have had at least a chance massinger was in his right place such as it was and one would not disturb the gentle ford who was never born to storm the footlights webster could have done no good anyhow or anywhere the man was a fool and chapman would always have been a blathering unreadable pedant li

so that you can stand being questioned without looking more like a silly fool than you can help i ll do what i can for you said mr stokes but i don t s pose your missis ll come to me at all she saw you plain enough they walked on in silence and still deep in thought over the matter turned into a neighboring tavern for refreshment mr henshaw drank his with the air of a man performing a duty to his constitution but mr stokes smacking his lips waxed eloquent over the brew i hardly know what i m drinking said his friend forlornly i suppose it s four half because that s what i asked for mr stokes gazed at him in deep sympathy it can t be so bad as that he said with concern you wait till you re married said mr henshaw brusquely you d no business to ask me to go with you and i was a good

here i say well said mr henshaw shaking off the hand which the other had laid on his arm you you be alfred bell said mr stokes breathlessly mr henshaw started and eyed him nervously his friend s eyes were bright and he fancied a bit wild be alfred bell repeated mr stokes don t you see pretend to be alfred bell and go with me to your missis i ll lend you a suit o clothes and a fresh neck tie and

it fancy the two of us sitting there and talking to her and waiting for you to come in and wondering what s making you so late mr henshaw regarded him steadfastly for some seconds and then taking a firm hold of his mug slowly drained the contents and what about my voice he demanded with something approaching a sneer that s right said mr stokes hotly it wouldn t be you if you didn t try to make difficulties but what about it said mr henshaw obstinately you can alter it can t you said the other they were alone in the bar and mr henshaw after some persuasion was induced to try a few experiments he ranged from bass which hurt his throat to a falsetto which put mr stokes s teeth on edge but in vain the rehearsal was stopped at last by the landlord who having twice come into the bar under the impression that fresh customers had entered spoke his mind at some length seem to think you re in a blessed monkey house he concluded severely we thought we was said mr stokes with a long appraising sniff as he opened the door it s a mistake anybody might make he pushed mr henshaw into the street as the landlord placed a hand on the flap of the bar and followed him out you ll have to

outside of a bus with me and a couple o ladies see try usky whispers now mr henshaw tried and his friend observing that he was taking but a languid interest in the scheme was loud in his praises i should never ave known you he declared why it s wonderful why didn t you tell me you could act like that mr henshaw remarked modestly that he had not been aware of it himself and taking a more hopeful view of the situation whispered himself into such a state of hoarseness that another visit for refreshment became absolutely necessary keep your art up and practise said mr stokes as he shook hands with him some time later and if you can manage it get off at four o clock to morrow and we ll go round to see her while she thinks you re still at work illustration and what about my voice he demanded mr henshaw complimented him upon his artfulness and with some confidence in a man of such resource walked home in a more cheerful frame of mind his heart sank as he reached the house but to his relief the lights were out and his wife was in bed he was up early next morning but his wife showed no signs of rising the cupboard was still empty and for some time he moved about hungry and undecided

up the receiver as one in a trance it can t be what i asked mr tyler is dead he answered in a dull voice he died at sea suddenly yesterday the next ten days were occupied in burying mr bowen j tyler sr and arranging plans for the succor of his son mr tom billings the late mr tyler s secretary did it all he is force energy initiative and good judgment combined and personified i never have beheld a more dynamic young man he handled lawyers courts and executors as a sculptor handles his modeling clay he formed fashioned and forced them to his will he had been a classmate of bowen tyler at college and a fraternity brother and before that he had been an impoverished and improvident cow puncher on one of the great tyler ranches tyler sr had picked him out of thousands of employees and made him or rather tyler had given him the opportunity and then billings had made himself tyler jr as good a judge of men as his father had taken him into his friendship and between the two of them they had turned out a man who would have died for a tyler as quickly as he would have for his flag yet there was none of the sycophant or fawner in billings ordinarily i do not wax enthusiastic about men but this man billings comes as close to my conception of what a regular man should be as any i have ever met i venture to say that before bowen j tyler sent him to college he had never heard the word ethics and yet i am equally sure that in all his life he never has transgressed a single tenet of the code of ethics of an american gentleman ten days after they brought mr tyler s body off the toreador we steamed out into the pacific in search of caprona there were forty in the party including the master and crew of the toreador and billings the indomitable was in command we had a long and uninteresting search for caprona for the old map upon which the assistant secretary had finally located it was most inaccurate when its grim walls finally rose out of the ocean s mists before us we were so far south that it was a question as to whether we were in the south pacific or the antarctic bergs were numerous and it was very cold all during the trip billings had steadfastly evaded questions as to how we were to enter caspak after we had found caprona bowen tyler s manuscript had made it perfectly evident to all that the subterranean outlet of the caspakian river was the only means of ingress or egress to the crater world beyond the impregnable cliffs tyler s party had been able to navigate this channel because their craft had been a submarine but the toreador could as easily have flown over the cliffs as sailed under them jimmy hollis and colin short whiled away many an hour inventing schemes for surmounting the obstacle presented by the barrier cliffs and making ridiculous wagers as to which one tom billings had in mind but immediately we were all assured that we had raised caprona billings called us together there was no use in talking about these things he said until we found the island at best it can be but conjecture on our part until we have been able to scrutinize the coast closely each of us has formed a mental picture of the capronian seacoast from bowen s manuscript and it is not likely that any two of these pictures resemble each other or that any of them resemble the coast as we shall presently find it i have in view three plans for scaling the cliffs and the means for carrying out each is in the hold there is an electric drill with plenty of waterproof cable to reach from the ship s dynamos to the cliff top when the toreador is anchored at a safe distance from shore and there is sufficient half inch iron rod to build a ladder from the base to the top of the cliff it would be a long arduous and dangerous work to bore the holes and insert the rungs of the ladder from the bottom upward yet it can be done i also have a life saving mortar with which we might be able to throw a line over the summit of the cliffs but this plan would necessitate one of us climbing to the top with the chances more than even that the line would cut at the summit or the hooks at the upper end would slip my third plan seems to me the most feasible you all saw a number of large heavy boxes lowered into the hold before we sailed i know you did because you asked me what they contained and commented upon the large letter h which was painted upon each box these boxes contain the various parts of a hydro aeroplane i purpose assembling this upon the strip of beach described in bowen s manuscript the beach where he found the dead body of the apelike man provided there is sufficient space above high water otherwise we shall have to assemble it on deck and lower it over the side after it is assembled i shall carry tackle and ropes to the cliff top and then it will be comparatively simple to hoist the search party and its supplies in safety or i can make a sufficient number of trips to land the entire party in the valley beyond the barrier all will depend of course upon what my first reconnaissance reveals that afternoon we steamed slowly along the face of caprona s towering barrier you see now remarked billings as we craned our necks to scan the summit thousands of feet above us how futile it would have been to waste our time in working out details of a plan to surmount those and he jerked his thumb toward the cliffs it would take weeks possibly months to construct a ladder to the top i had no conception of their formidable height our mortar would not carry a line halfway to the crest of the lowest point there is no use discussing any plan other than the hydro aeroplane we ll find the beach and get busy late the following morning the lookout announced that he could discern surf about a mile ahead and

as a present for my mother it must be confessed however that some of our men behaved very badly in this matter of the statues and the pictures the people at venice were very much attached to them and as to the four bronze horses which stood over the gate of their great church they loved them as dearly as if they had been their children i have always been a judge of a horse and i had a good look at these ones but i could not see that there was much to be said for them they were too coarse limbed for light cavalry charges and they had not the weight for the gun teams however they were the only four horses alive or dead in the whole town so it was not to be expected that the people would know any better they wept bitterly when they were sent away and ten french soldiers were found floating in the canals that night as a punishment for these murders a great many more of their pictures were sent away and the soldiers took to breaking the statues and firing their muskets at the stained glass windows this made the people furious and there was very bad feeling in the town many officers and men disappeared during that winter and even their bodies were never found for myself i had plenty to do and i never found the time heavy on my hands in every country it has been my custom to try to learn the language for this reason i always look round for some lady who will be kind enough to teach it to me and then we practise it together this is the most interesting way of picking it up and before i was thirty i could speak nearly every tongue in europe but it must be confessed that what you learn is not of much use for the ordinary purposes of life my business for example has usually been with soldiers and peasants and what advantage is it to be able to say to them that i love only them and that i will come back when the wars are over never have i had so sweet a teacher as in venice lucia was her first name and her second but a gentleman forgets second names i can say this with all discretion that she was of one of the senatorial families of venice and that her grandfather had been doge of the town she was of an exquisite beauty and when i etienne gerard use such a word as exquisite my friends it has a meaning i have judgment i have memories i have the means of comparison of all the women who have loved me there are not twenty to whom i could apply such a term as that but i say again that lucia was exquisite of the dark type i do not recall her equal unless it were dolores of toledo there was a little brunette whom i loved at santarem when i was soldiering under massena in portugal her name has escaped me she was of a perfect beauty but she had not the figure nor the grace of lucia there was agnes also i could not put one before the other but i do none an injustice when i say that lucia was the equal of the best it was over this matter of pictures that i had first met her for her father owned a palace on the farther side of the rialto bridge upon the grand canal and it was so packed with wall paintings that suchet sent a party of sappers to cut some of them out and send them to paris i had gone down with them and after i had seen lucia in tears it appeared to me that the plaster would crack if it were taken from the support of the wall i said so and the sappers were withdrawn after that i was the friend of the family and many a flask of chianti have i cracked with the father and many a sweet lesson have i had from the daughter some of our french officers married in venice that winter and i might have done the same for i loved her with all my heart but etienne gerard has his sword his horse his regiment his mother his emperor and his career a debonair hussar has room in his life for love but none for a wife so i thought then my friends but i did not see the lonely days when i should long to clasp those vanished hands and turn my head away when i saw old comrades with their tall children standing round their chairs this love which i had thought was a joke and a plaything it is only now that i understand that it is the moulder of one s life the most solemn and sacred of all things thank you my friend thank you it is a good wine and a second bottle cannot hurt and now i will tell you how my love for lucia was the cause of one of the most terrible of all the wonderful adventures which have ever befallen me and how it was that i came to lose the top of my right ear you have often asked me why it was missing to night for the first time i will tell you suchet s head quarters at that time was the old palace of the doge dandolo which stands on the lagoon not far from the place of san marco it was near the end of the winter and i had returned one night from the theatre goldini when i found a note from lucia and a gondola waiting she prayed me to come to her at once as she was in trouble to a frenchman and a soldier there was but one answer to such a note in an instant i was in the boat and the gondolier was pushing out into the dark lagoon i remember that as i took my seat in the boat i was struck by the man s great size he was not tall but he was one of the broadest men that i have ever seen in my life but the gondoliers of venice are a strong breed and powerful men are common enough among them the fellow took his place behind me and began to row a good soldier in an enemy s country should everywhere and at all times be on the alert it has been one of the rules of my life and if i have lived to wear grey hairs it is because i have observed it and yet upon that night i was as careless as

learn what will and what will not agree with the body and find little difficulty in refusing a piece of the tempting pudding or pie which is associated in our memory with that terrible attack of indigestion and whose very name irresistibly recalls rhubarb and magnesia but it takes a great many lessons to convince us how indigestible some of our favourite lines of reading are and again and again we make a meal of the unwholesome novel sure to be followed by its usual train of low spirits unwillingness to work weariness of existence in fact by mental nightmare then we should be careful to provide this wholesome food in proper amount mental gluttony or over reading is a dangerous propensity tending to weakness of digestive power and in some cases to loss of appetite we know that bread is a good and wholesome food but who would like to try the experiment of eating two or three loaves at a sitting i have heard a physician telling his patient whose complaint was merely gluttony and want of exercise that the earliest symptom of hyper nutrition is a deposition of adipose tissue and no doubt the fine long words greatly consoled the poor man under his increasing load of fat i wonder if there is such a thing in nature as a fat mind i really think i have met with one or two minds which could not keep up with the slowest trot in conversation could not jump over a logical fence to save their lives always got stuck fast in a narrow argument and in short were fit for nothing but to waddle helplessly through the world then again though the food be wholesome and in proper amount we know that we must not consume too many kinds at once take the thirsty a quart of beer or a quart of cider or even a quart of cold tea and he will probably thank you though not so heartily in the last case but what think you his feelings would be if you offered him a tray containing a little mug of beer a little mug of cider another of cold tea one of hot tea one of coffee one of cocoa and corresponding vessels of milk water brandy and water and butter milk the sum total might be a quart but would it be the same thing to the haymaker having settled the proper kind amount and variety of our mental food it remains that we should be careful to allow proper intervals between meal and meal and not swallow the food hastily without mastication so that it may be thoroughly digested both which rules for the body are also applicable at once to the mind first as to the intervals these are as really necessary as they are for the body with this difference only that while the body requires three or four hours rest before it is ready for another meal the mind will in many cases do with three or four minutes i believe that the interval required is much shorter than is generally supposed and from personal experience i would recommend anyone who has to devote several hours together to one subject of thought to try the effect of such a break say once an hour l

thing crept up and said my child you shall be too clever this fairy s gift would have pleased the queen if she had believed in it more than anything else because she was so clever herself but she took no notice at all and the fairies went each to her own country and none of them stayed there at the palace where nobody believed in them except the king a little but the queen tossed all their nice boots and caps carpets purses swords and all away into a dark lumber room for of course she thought that they were all nonsense and merely old rubbish out of books or pantomime properties chapter ii chapter heading picture p jpg prince prigio and his family well the little prince grew up i think i ve told you that his name was prigio did i not well that was his name you cannot think how clever he was he argued with his nurse as soon as he could speak which was very soon he argued that he did not like to be washed because the soap got into his eyes however when he was told all about the pores of the skin and how they could not be healthy if he was not washed he at once ceased to resist for he was very reasonable he argued with his father that he did not see why there should be kings who were rich while beggars were poor and why the king who was a little greedy should have poached eggs and plum cake at afternoon tea while many other persons went without dinner the king was so surprised and hurt at these remarks that he boxed the prince s ears saying i ll teach you to be too clever my lad then he remembered the awful curse of the oldest fairy and was sorry for the rudeness of the queen and when the prince after having his ears boxed said that force was no argument the king went away in a rage prigio reading a book p jpg indeed i cannot tell you how the prince was hated by all he would go down into the kitchen and show the cook how to make soup he would visit the poor people s cottage and teach them how to make the beds and how to make plum pudding out of turnip tops and venison cutlets out of rusty bacon he showed the fencing master how to fence and the professional cricketer how to bowl and instructed the rat catcher in breeding terriers he set sums to the chancellor of the exchequer and assured the astronomer royal that the sun does not go round the earth which for my part i believe it does the young ladies of the court disliked dancing with him in spite of his good looks because he was always asking have you read this and have you read that and when they said they hadn t he sneered and when they said they had he found them out he found out all his tutors and masters in the same horrid way correcting the accent of his french teacher and trying to get his german tutor not to eat peas with his knife he also endeavoured to teach the queen dowager his grandmother an art with which she had long been perfectly familiar in fact he knew everything better than anybody else and the worst of it was that he did and he was never in the wrong and he always said didn t i tell you so and what was more he had as time went on prince prigio had two younger brothers whom everybody liked they were not a bit clever but jolly prince alphonso the third son was round fat good humoured and as brave as a lion prince enrico the second was tall thin and a little sad but never too clever both were in love with two of their own cousins with the approval of their dear parents and all the world said what nice unaffected princes they are but prigio nearly got the country into several wars by being too clever for the foreign ambassadors now as pantouflia was a rich lazy country which hated fighting this was very unpleasant and did not make people love prince prigio any better chapter iii about the firedrake of all the people who did not like prigio his own dear papa king grognio disliked him most for the king knew he was not clever himself when he was in the counting house counting out his money and when he happened to say sixteen shillings and fourteen and twopence are three pounds fifteen it made him wild to hear prigio whisper one pound ten and twopence which of course it is and the king was afraid that prigio would conspire and get made king himself which was the last thing prigio really wanted he much preferred to idle about and know everything without seeming to take any trouble the king at his desk p jpg well the king thought and thought how was he to get prigio out of the way and make enrico or alphonso his successor he read in books about it and all the books showed that if a king sent his three sons to do anything it was always the youngest who did it and got the crown and he wished he had the chance well it arrived at last there was a very hot summer it began to be hot in march all the rivers were dried up the grass did not grow the corn did not grow the thermometers exploded with heat the barometers stood at set fair the people were much distressed and came and broke the palace windows as they usually do when things go wrong in pantouflia the king consulted the learned men about the court who told him that probably a firedrake was in the neighbourhood now the firedrake is a beast or bird about the bigness of an elephant its body is made of iron and it is always red hot a more terrible and cruel beast cannot be imagined for if you go near it you are at once broiled by the firedrake but the king was not ill pleased for thought he of course my three sons must go after the brute the eldest first and as usual it will kill the first two and be beaten by the youngest it is a little hard on enrico poor boy but anything to get rid

noted una at all when you met her you first noted her gentle face her fine textured hair of faded gold and her rimless eye glasses with a gold chain over her ear these glasses made a business like center to her face you felt that without them she would have been too childish her mouth was as kind as her spirited eyes but it drooped her body was so femininely soft that you regarded her as rather plump but for all her curving hips and the thick ankles which she considered common she was rather anemic her cheeks were round not rosy but clear and soft her lips a pale pink her chin was plucky and undimpled it was usually spotted with one or two unimportant eruptions which she kept so well covered with powder that they were never noticeable no one ever thought of them except una herself to whom they were tragic blemishes which she timorously examined in the mirror every time she went to wash her hands she knew that they were the result of the indigestible golden family meals she tried to take comfort by noticing their prevalence among other girls but they kept startling her anew she would secretly touch them with a worried forefinger and wonder whether men were able to see anything else in her face you remembered her best as she hurried through the street in her tan mackintosh with its yellow velveteen collar turned high up and one of those modest round hats to which she was addicted for then you were aware only of the pale gold hair fluffing round her school mistress eye glasses her gentle air of respectability and her undistinguished littleness she trusted in the village ideal of virginal vacuousness as the type of beauty which most captivated men though every year she was more shrewdly doubtful of the divine superiority of these men that a woman s business in life was to remain respectable and to secure a man and consequent security was her unmeditated faith till in when una was twenty four years old her father died xa captain golden left to wife and daughter a good name a number of debts and eleven hundred dollars in lodge insurance the funeral was scarcely over before neighbors the furniture man the grocer the polite old homeopathic doctor began to come in with bland sympathy and large bills when the debts were all cleared away the goldens had only six hundred dollars and no income beyond the good name all right minded persons agree that a good name is precious beyond rubies but una would have preferred less honor and more rubies she was so engaged in comforting her mother that she scarcely grieved for her father she took charge of everything money house bills mrs golden had been overwhelmed by a realization that however slack and shallow captain golden had been he had adored her and encouraged her in her gentility her pawing at culture with an emerging sincerity mrs golden mourned him now missed his gossipy presence and at the same time she was alive to the distinction it added to her slim gracefulness to wear black and look wan she sobbed on una s shoulder she said that she was lonely and una sturdily comforted her and looked for work one of the most familiar human combinations in the world is that of unemployed daughter and widowed mother a thousand times you have seen the jobless daughter devoting all of her curiosity all of her youth to a widowed mother of small pleasantries a small income and a shabby security thirty comes and thirty five the daughter ages steadily at forty she is as old as her unwithering mother sweet she is and pathetically hopeful of being a pianist or a nurse never quite reconciled to spinsterhood though she often laughs about it often by her insistence that she is an old maid she makes the thought of her barren age embarrassing to others the mother is sweet too and wants to keep in touch with her daughter s interests only her daughter has no interests had the daughter revolted at eighteen had she stubbornly insisted that mother either accompany her to parties or be content to stay alone had she acquired interests she might have meant something in the new generation but the time for revolt passes however much the daughter may long to seem young among younger women the mother is usually unconscious of her selfishness she would be unspeakably horrified if some brutal soul told her that she was a vampire chance chance and waste rule them both and the world passes by while the mother has her games of cards with daughter and deems herself unselfish because now and then she lets daughter join a party only to hasten back to mother and even wonders why daughter doesn t take an interest in girls her own age that ugly couple on the porch of the apple sauce and wash pitcher boarding house the mother a mute dwarfish punchinello and the daughter a drab woman of forty with a mole a wart a silence that charming mother of white hair and real lace with the well groomed daughter that comfortable mother at home and daughter in an office but with no suitors no ambition beyond the one at home they are all examples of the mother and daughter phenomenon that most touching most destructive example of selfless unselfishness which robs all the generations to come because mother has never been trained to endure the long long thoughts of solitude because she sees nothing by herself and within herself hears no diverting voice there were many such mothers and daughters in panama if they were wealthy daughter collected rents and saw lawyers and belonged to a club and tried to keep youthful at parties if middle class daughter taught school almost invariably if poor mother did the washing and daughter collected it so it was marked down for una that she should be a teacher not that she wanted to be a teacher after

indian had crudely voiced a skepticism i had heard more delicately hinted in new york and singularly enough which had strengthened on our way west as we met ranchers prospectors and cowboys but those

bluntness say young feller i heerd yer couldn t git acrost the canyon fer the deep snow on the north rim wal ye re lucky now yer hit the trail fer new york an keep goin don t ever tackle the desert

s hell on ropin things an he s wusser n hell on men an hosses an dogs all that my well meaning friend suggested made me of course only the more eager to go with jones where i had once been interested in the old buffalo hunter i was now fascinated and now i was with him in the desert and seeing him as he was a simple quiet man who fitted the mountains and the silences and the long reaches of distance it does seem hard to believe all this about jones remarked judd one of emmett s men how could a man have the strength and the nerve and isn t it cruel to keep wild animals in captivity it against god s word quick as speech could flow jones quoted and god said let us make man in our image and give him dominion over the fish of the sea the fowls of the air over all the cattle and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth dominion over all the beasts of the field repeated jones his big voice rolling out he clenched his huge fists and spread wide his long arms dominion that was god s word the power and intensity of him could be felt then he relaxed dropped his arms and once more grew calm but he had shown a glimpse of the great strange and absorbing passion of his life once he had told me how when a mere child he had hazarded limb and neck to capture a fox squirrel how he had held on to the vicious little animal though it bit his hand through how he had never learned to play the games of boyhood that when the youths of the little illinois village were at play he roamed the prairies or the rolling wooded hills or watched a gopher hole that boy was father of the man for sixty years an enduring passion for dominion over wild animals had possessed him and made his life an endless pursuit our guests the navajos departed early and vanished silently in the gloom of the desert we settled down again into a quiet that was broken only by the low chant like song of a praying mormon suddenly the hounds bristled and old moze a surly and aggressive dog rose and barked at some real or imaginary desert prowler a sharp command from jones made moze crouch down and the other hounds cowered close together better tie up the dogs suggested jones like as not coyotes run down here from the hills the hounds were my especial delight but jones regarded them with considerable contempt when all was said this was no small wonder for that quintet of long eared canines would have tried the patience of a saint old moze was a missouri hound that jones had procured in that state of uncertain qualities and the dog had grown old over coon trails he was black and white grizzled and battlescarred and if ever a dog had an evil eye moze was that dog he had a way of wagging his tail an indeterminate equivocal sort of wag as if he realized his ugliness and knew he stood little chance of making friends but was still hopeful and willing as for me the first time he manifested this evidence of a good heart under a rough coat he won me forever to tell of moze s derelictions up to that time would take more space than would a history of the whole trip but the enumeration of several incidents will at once stamp him as a dog of character and will establish the fact that even if his progenitors had never taken any blue ribbons they had at least bequeathed him fighting blood at flagstaff we chained him in the yard of a livery stable next morning we found him hanging by his chain on the other side of an eight foot fence we took him down expecting to have the sorrowful duty of burying him but moze shook himself wagged his tail and then pitched into the livery stable dog as a matter of fact fighting was his forte he whipped all of the dogs in flagstaff and when our blood hounds came on from california he put three of them hors de combat at once and subdued the pup with a savage growl his crowning feat however made even the stoical jones open his mouth in amaze we had taken moze to the el tovar at the grand canyon and finding it impossible to get over to the north rim we left him with one of jones s men called rust who was working on the canyon trail rust s instructions were to bring moze to flagstaff in two weeks he brought the dog a little ahead time and roared his appreciation of the relief it to get the responsibility off his hands and he related many strange things most striking of which was how moze had broken his chain and plunged

name of being exceedingly particular with regard to the status of their agents and he must be entirely a newcomer in international matters from the dossier you handed me jocelyn thew reads more like a kind of modern swashbuckler spoiling for a fight than a person likely to make a success of a secret service job don t you worry hobson replied jocelyn thew could hold his own at any court in europe with any of you embassy swaggerers there s nothing known about his family but they say that his father was an english aristocrat and he looks like it too it was you yourself who called him a criminal

out of that country neither i nor anybody else on the force can imagine but he did it i know the stockbroker down town who handles his investments here s our man at last the door was opened by the floor waiter who held it while a thin dark man dressed in civilian clothes of most correct cut passed in hobson gripped him at once by the hand chief downs he said this is my friend mr crawshay who is connected with the english embassy over here you can shake hands with him later we re on a job of business and the first thing before us is to get an answer from you to a certain question did you send

of women taking part in politics mr kettle sir john kelvil my love kelvil kelvil the growing influence of women is the one reassuring thing in our political life lady caroline women are always on the

for a time cassidy and his men had floundered knee deep and often deeper among the roots while they plied the ax and saw then they dumped in carload after carload of rock and gravel but the muskeg absorbed it and waited for more it was apparently insatiable and for cassidy drove them savagely the men s tempers grew shorter under the strain until some who had drawn a sufficient proportion of their wages to warrant it rolled up their blankets and walked out reviling him still most of them stayed with the task and toiled on sullenly in the mire under a scorching heat for it was summer in the wilderness affairs were in this condition when clarence weston crawled out of the swamp one evening and sat down on a cedar log before he followed his comrades up the track though he supposed that supper would shortly be laid out in the sleeping shanty the sunlight that flung lurid flecks of color upon the western side of the fir trunks beat upon his dripping face which though a little worn and grim just then was otherwise a pleasant face of the fair english type in fact though he had been some years in the country englishman was unmistakably stamped upon him he was attired scantily and simply in a very old blue shirt and trousers which also had once been blue of duck and just then he was very weary and more than a little lame he had cut himself about the ankle when chopping a week earlier and though the wound had partly healed his foot was still painful there were also a good many other scars and bruises upon his body for the cost of building a western railroad is usually heavy still he had an excellent constitution and was while not particularly brilliant as a rule at least whimsically contented in mind his comrades called him the kid or the english kid perhaps on account of a certain delicacy of manner and expression which he had somehow contrived to retain though he had spent several years in logging camps and his age was close onto twenty five while he sat there with the shovel that had worn his hands hard lying at his feet cassidy who had not recovered from the interview he had had with stirling that morning strode by hot and out of temper and then stopped and swung round on him too stiff to get up hustle before the mosquitoes eat you when supper s ready he said weston glanced down at his foot i was on the gravel bank all afternoon it s steep seemed to wrench the cut well said cassidy i ve no kind of use for a man who doesn t know enough to keep himself from getting hurt you have got to get that foot better right away or get out he shook a big hard fist at the swamp how m i going to fill up that pit with a crowd of stiffs and deadbeats like those i m driving now you make me tired he did not wait for an answer to the query but plodded away and weston sat still a few minutes longer with a wry smile in his eyes he resented being over driven though he was more or less used to it and now and then he found his superior s vitriolic comments upon his efforts almost intolerably galling still he had sense enough to realize that the remedy open to him was a somewhat hazardous one because while it would be easy to walk out of the construction camp industrial activity just then was unusually slack in the mountain province besides he was willing to admit that there were excuses for cassidy and there was a certain quiet tenacity in him he was also aware that the man with little money has generally a good deal to bear for weston was one who could learn by experience though that faculty was not one that hitherto had characterized the family from which he sprang none of the westons had ever been remarkable for genius a fact of which they were rather proud than otherwise they had for several generations been content to be men of local importance in a secluded nook of rural england which is not the kind of life that is conducive to original thought or enterprising action they had chosen wives like themselves from among their neighbors and it was perhaps in several respects not altogether fortunate for clarence weston that his mother had been ultra conservative in her respect for traditions since he had inherited one side of her nature still in her case at least the respect had been idealistic and the traditions of the highest and though she had died when he was eighteen she had instilled into him a certain delicacy of sentiment and a simple chivalrous code that had somewhat hampered him in the rough life he had led in the canadian dominion as a very young man he had quarreled with his father over a matter trifling in itself but each had clung to his opinions with the obstinacy of men who have few ideas to spare and clarence had gone out to seek his fortune in western canada he had naturally failed to find it and the first discovery that there was apparently nobody in that wide country who was ready to appraise either his mental attainments or his bodily activity at the value of his board was a painful shock to the sanguine lad that first year was a bad one to him but he set his teeth and quietly bore all that befell him the odd brutal task paid for at half the usual wages the frequent rebuffs the long nights spent shelterless in the bush utter weariness and often downright hunger it was a hard school but it taught him much and he graduated as a man strong and comely of body and resolute of mind what was more he had though he scarcely realized it after all only left behind in england a cramped life embittered by a steady shrinkage in the rent roll and as steady an increase in taxation and expenses his present life was clean and governed by a code of crude and austere simplicity his mother s spirit was in him and being what he was there were things he could not do he did not attempt to reason about them

better when all of a sudden the cook sat up in is bunk with a dreadful laughing scream and called out that somebody was ticklin im i got into my bunk and bill got into is and we lay there listening while the cook who was a terrible ticklish man leaned out of is bunk and said wot e d do if it appened ag in go to sleep says walter jones you re dreamin who d you think would want to tickle you i tell you says the cook somebody come over and tickled me with a and the size of a leg o mutton i feel creepy all over bill gave it up for that night but the next day e pretended to think jimmy was gettin fat an e caught old of im and prodded im all over he thought e felt something round is waist but e couldn t be sure and jimmy made such a noise that the other chaps interfered and told bill to leave im alone for a whole week we tried to find that money and couldn t and bill said it was a suspicious thing that jimmy kept aft a good deal more than e used to and e got an idea that the boy might ha idden it somewhere there at the end of that time owever owing to our being short anded jimmy was sent for ard to work as ordinary seaman and it began to be quite noticeable the way e avoided bill at last one day we got im alone down the fo c sle and bill put is arm round im and got im on the locker and asked im straight out where the money was why i chucked it overboard he says i told you so afore what a memory you ve got bill bill picked im up and laid im on the locker and we searched im thoroughly we even took is boots off and then we ad another look in is bunk while e was putting em on ag in if you re innercent says bill why don t you call out eh because you told me not to say anything about it bill says the boy but i will next time loud i will look ere says bill you tell us where it is and the three of us ll go shares in it that ll be two undered pounds each and we ll tell you ow to get yours changed without getting caught we re cleverer than you are you know i know that

design is no longer to be traced so when the successive layers of jewish and christian traditional pigment laid on at intervals for near three thousand years had been removed by even the tenderest critical operations there was not much to be discerned of the leader of the exodus only one point became perfectly clear to me namely that moses is not responsible for nine tenths of the pentateuch certainly not for the legends which had been made the bugbears of science in fact the fence turned out to be a mere heap of dry sticks and brushwood and one might walk through it with impunity the which i did but i was still young when i thus ventured to assert my liberty and young people are apt to be filled with a kind of s va indignatio when they discover the wide discrepancies between things as they seem and things as they are it hurts their vanity to feel that they have prepared themselves for a mighty struggle to climb over or break their way through a rampart which turns out on close approach to be a mere heap of ruins venerable indeed and arch ologically interesting but of no other moment and some fragment of the superfluous energy accumulated is apt to find vent in strong language such i suppose was my case when i wrote some passages which occur in an essay reprinted among darwiniana but when not long ago the voice put it to me whether i had better not expunge or modify these passages whether really they were not a little too strong i had to reply with all deference that while from a merely literary point of view i might admit them to be rather crude i must stand by the substance of these items of my expenditure i further ventured to express the conviction that scientific criticism of the old testament since has justified every word of the estimate of the authority of the ecclesiastical moses written at that time and carried away by the heat of self justification i even ventured to add that the desperate attempt now set afoot to force biblical and post biblical mythology into elementary instruction renders it useful and necessary to go on making a considerable outlay in the same direction not yet has the cosmogony of the semi barbarous hebrew ceased to be the incubus of the philosopher and the opprobrium of the orthodox not yet has the zeal of the bibliolater ceased from troubling not yet are the weaker sort even of the instructed at rest from their fruitless toil to harmonise impossibilities and to force the generous new wine of science into the old bottles of judaism but i am aware that the head and front of my offending lies not now where it formerly lay thirty years ago criticism of moses was held by most respectable people to be deadly sin now it has sunk to the rank of a mere peccadillo at least if it stops short of the history of abraham destroy the foundation of most forms of dogmatic christianity contained in the second chapter of genesis if you will the new ecclesiasticism undertakes to underpin the superstructure and make it at any rate to the eye as firm as ever but let him be anathema who applies exactly the same canons of criticism to the opening chapters of matthew or of luke school children may be told that the world was by no means made in six days and that implicit belief in the story of noah s ark is permissible only as a matter of business to their toy makers but they are to hold for the certainest of truths to be doubted only at peril of their salvation that their galilean fellow child jesus nineteen centuries ago had no human father well we will pass the item of said the voice but why all this more recent coil about the gadarene swine and the like do you pretend that these poor animals got in your way years and years after the mosaic fences were down at any rate so far as you are concerned got in my way why my good voice they were driven in my way i had happened to make a statement than which so far as i have ever been able to see nothing can be more modest or inoffensive to wit that i am convinced of my own utter ignorance about a great number of things respecting which the great majority of my neighbours not only those of adult years but children repeating their catechisms affirm themselves to possess full information i ask any candid and impartial judge is that attacking anybody or anything yet if i had made the most wanton and arrogant onslaught on the honest convictions of other people i could not have been more hardly dealt with the pentecostal charism i believe exhausted itself amongst the earliest disciples yet any one who has had to attend as i have done to copious objurgations strewn with such appellations as infidel and coward must be a hardened sceptic indeed if he doubts the existence of a gift of tongues in the churches of our time unless indeed it should occur to him that some of these outpourings may have taken place after the third hour of the day i am far from thinking that it is worth while to give much attention to these inevitable incidents of all controversies in which one party has acquired the mental peculiarities which are generated by the habit of much talking with immunity from criticism but as a rule they are the sauce of dishes of misrepresentations and inaccuracies which it may be a duty nay even an innocent pleasure to expose in the particular case of which i am thinking i felt as strauss says able and called upon to undertake the business and it is no responsibility of mine if i found the gospels with their miraculous stories of which the gadarene is a typical example blocking my way as heretofore the pentateuch had done i was challenged to question the authority for the theory of

askaris have been washed up from the river the doctor informed him and two of your ponies have been eaten by lions you will excuse i have the wounds of a native to dress who was bitten last night by a jaguar the traveller left alone lay still in the hut and his thoughts wandered backwards he looked out over the bare scrubby stretch of land which had been cleared for this encampment to the mass of bush and flowering shrubs beyond mysterious and impenetrable save for that rough elephant track along which he had travelled to the broad bosomed river blue as the sky above and to the mountains fading into mist beyond the face of his host had carried him back into the past puzzled reminiscence tugged at the strings of memory it came to him later on at dinner time when they three the commandant the doctor and himself sat at a little table arranged just outside the hut that they might catch the faint breeze from the mountains herald of the swift falling darkness native servants beat the air around them with bamboo fans to keep off the insects and the air was faint almost to noxiousness with the perfume of some sickly exotic shrub why you re devinter he exclaimed suddenly sigismund devinter you were at eton with me horrock s house semi final in the racquets and magdalen afterwards number five in the boat and why the devil did the doctor here tell me that your name was von ragastein because it happens to be the truth was the somewhat measured reply devinter is my family name and the one by which i was known when in england when i succeeded to the barony and estates

unless i have spirits i have something better than either von ragastein replied you shall give me your opinion of this the orderly who stood behind his master s chair received a whispered order disappeared into the commissariat hut and came back presently with a bottle at the sight of which the englishman gasped napoleon he exclaimed just a few bottles i had sent to me his host explained i am delighted to offer it to some one who will appreciate it by jove there s no mistake about that dominey declared rolling it around in his glass what a world i hadn t eaten for thirty hours when i rolled up here last night and drunk nothing but filthy water for days to night fricassee of chicken white bread cabinet hock and napoleon brandy and to morrow again well who knows when do you move on von ragastein not for several days what the mischief do you find to do so far from headquarters if you don t shoot lions or elephants his guest asked curiously if you really wish to know von ragastein replied i am annoying your political agents immensely by moving from place to place collecting natives for drill but what do you want to drill them for dominey persisted i heard some time ago that you have four times as many natives under arms as we have you don t want an army here you re not likely to quarrel with us or the portuguese it is our custom von ragastein declared a little didactically in germany and wherever we germans go to be prepared not only for what is likely to happen but for what might possibly happen a war in my younger days when i was in the army dominey mused might have

still they could move a little up and down said the medical man easier far easier down than up and you cannot move at all in time you cannot get away from the present moment my dear sir that is just where you are wrong that is just where the whole world has gone wrong we are always getting away from the present moment our mental existences which are immaterial and have no dimensions are passing along the time dimension with a uniform velocity from the cradle to the grave just as we should travel down if we began our existence fifty miles above the earth s surface but the great difficulty is this interrupted the psychologist you can move about in all directions of space but you cannot move about in time that is the germ of my great discovery but you are wrong to say that we cannot move about in time for instance if i am recalling an incident very vividly i go back to the instant of its occurrence i become absent minded as you say i jump back for a moment of course we have no means of staying back for any length of time any more than a savage or an animal has of staying six feet above the ground but a civilized man is better off than the savage in this respect he can go up against gravitation in a balloon and why should he not hope that ultimately he may be able to stop or accelerate his drift along the time dimension or even turn about and travel the other way oh this began filby is all why not said the time traveller it s against reason said filby what reason said the time traveller you can show black is white by argument said filby but you will never convince me possibly not said the time traveller but now you begin to see the object of my investigations into the geometry of four dimensions long ago i had a vague inkling of a machine to travel through time exclaimed the very young man that shall travel indifferently in any direction of space and time as the driver determines filby contented himself with laughter but i have experimental verification said the time traveller it would be remarkably convenient for the historian the psychologist suggested one might travel back and verify the accepted account of the battle of hastings for instance don t you think you would attract attention said the medical man our ancestors had no great tolerance for anachronisms one might get one s greek from the very lips of homer and plato the very young man thought in which case they would certainly plough you for the little go the german scholars have improved greek so much then there is the future said the very young man just think one might invest all one s money leave it to accumulate at interest and hurry on ahead to discover a society said i erected on a strictly communistic basis of all the wild extravagant theories began the psychologist yes so it seemed to me and so i never talked of it until experimental verification cried i you are going to verify that the experiment cried filby who was getting brain weary let s see your experiment anyhow said the psychologist though it s all humbug you know the time traveller smiled round at us then still smiling faintly and with his hands deep in his trousers pockets he walked slowly out of the room and we heard his slippers shuffling down the long passage to his laboratory the psychologist looked at us i wonder what he s got some sleight of hand trick or other said the medical man and filby tried to tell us about a conjurer he had seen at burslem but before he had finished his preface the time traveller came back and filby s anecdote collapsed the thing the time traveller held in his hand was a glittering metallic framework scarcely larger than a small clock and very delicately made there was ivory in it and some transparent crystalline substance and now i must be explicit for this that follows unless his explanation is to be accepted is an absolutely unaccountable thing he took one of the small octagonal tables that were scattered about the room and set it in front of the fire with two legs on the hearthrug on this table he placed the mechanism then he drew up a chair and sat down the only other object on the table was a small shaded lamp the bright light of which fell upon the model there were also perhaps a dozen candles about two in brass candlesticks upon the mantel and several in sconces so that the room was brilliantly illuminated i sat in a low arm chair nearest the fire and i drew this forward so as to be almost between the time traveller and the fireplace filby sat behind him looking over his shoulder the medical man and the provincial mayor watched him in profile from the right the psychologist from the left the very young man stood behind the psychologist we were all on the alert it appears incredible to me that any kind of trick however subtly conceived and however adroitly done could have been played upon us under these conditions the time traveller looked at us and then at the mechanism well said the psychologist this little affair said the time traveller resting his elbows upon the table and pressing his hands together above the apparatus is only a model it is my plan for a machine to travel through time you will notice that it looks singularly askew and that there is an odd twinkling appearance about this bar as though it was in some way unreal he pointed to the part with his finger also here is one little white lever and here is another the medical man got up out of his chair and peered into the thing it s beautifully made he said it took two years to make retorted the time traveller then when we had all imitated the

in it are conveyed thither by the fresh water streams that pour into it from all the continent of the world maury in his delightful work the physical geography of the sea tells us that water is nature s great carrier with its currents it conveys heat away from the torrid zone and ice from the frigid or bottling the caloric away in the vesicle of its vapour it first makes it impalpable and then conveys it by unknown paths to the most distant parts of the earth the materials of which the coral builds the island and the sea conch its shell are gathered by this restless leveller from mountains rocks and valleys in all latitudes some it washes down from the mountains of the moon in africa or out of the gold fields of australia or from the mines of potosi others from the battle fields of europe or from the marble quarries of ancient greece and rome the materials thus collected and carried over falls and down rapids are transported to the sea here as these substances cannot be evaporated they would accumulate to such a degree as to render the ocean uninhabitable by living creatures had not god provided against this by the most beautiful compensation he has filled the ocean with innumerable animals and marine plants whose special duty it is to seize and make use of the substances thus swept from the land and reconvert them into solids we cannot form an adequate conception of the extent of the great work carried on continually in this way but we see part of it in the chalk cliffs the marl beds of the sea shore and the coral islands of the south seas of which last more particular notice shall be taken in a succeeding chapter the operations of the ocean are manifold besides forming a great reservoir into which what may be termed the impurities of the land are conveyed it is as has been shown the great laboratory of nature where these are reconverted and the general balance restored but we cannot speak of these things without making passing reference to the operations of water as that wonder working agent of which the ocean constitutes but a part nothing in this world is ever lost or annihilated as the ocean receives all the water that flows from the land so it returns that water fresh and pure in the shape of vapour to the skies where in the form of clouds it is conveyed to those parts of the earth where its presence is most needed and precipitated in the form of rain and dew fertilising the soil replenishing rivers and lakes penetrating the earth s deep caverns whence it bubbles up in the shape of springs and after having gladdened the heart of man by driving his mills and causing his food to grow it finds its way again into the sea and thus the good work goes on with ceaseless regularity water beats upon the rocks of the sea shore until it pounds them into sand or rolls them into pebbles and boulders it also sweeps the rich soil from the mountains into the valleys in the form of snow it clothes the surface of the temperate and frigid zones with a warm mantle which preserves vegetable life from the killing frosts of winter in the form of ice it splits asunder the granite hills and in the northern regions it forms great glaciers or masses of solidified snow many miles in extent and many hundred feet thick these glaciers descend by slow imperceptible degrees to the sea their edges break off and fall into it and floating southward sometimes in great mountainous masses are seen by man in the shape of icebergs frequently huge rocks that have fallen upon these glaciers from cliffs in the arctic regions are carried by them to other regions and are deposited on flat beaches far from their native cliffs the saltness of the sea rendering it more dense necessarily renders it more buoyant than fresh water this is obviously a great advantage to man in the matter of commerce a ship does not sink so deep in the sea as it does in a fresh water lake hence it can carry more cargo with greater facility it is easier to swim in salt than in fresh water the only disadvantage to commerce in the saltness of the sea is the consequent unfitness of its water for drinking many and harrowing are the accounts of instances in which sailors have been reduced to the most terrible extremities for want of fresh water and many a time since navigation began have men been brought to feel the dread reality of that condition which is so forcibly expressed in the poem of the ancient mariner water water everywhere and not a drop to drink science however at length enabled us to overcome this disadvantage of saltness by the process of distillation men soon managed to procure enough water at least to save their lives one captain of a ship by accident lost all his fresh water and before he could put into port to replenish a gale of wind which lasted three weeks drove him far out to sea he had no distilling apparatus on board and it seemed as if all hope of the crew escaping the most horrible of deaths were utterly taken away in this extremity the captain s inventive genius came to his aid he happened to have on board an old iron pitch pot with a wooden cover using this as a boiler a pipe made of a pewter plate and a wooden cask as a receiver he set to work filled the pot with sea water put an ounce of soap therein to assist in purifying it and placed it on the fire when the pot began to boil the steam passed through the pipe into the cask where it was condensed into water minus the saline particles which not being evaporable were left behind in the pitch pot in less than an hour a quart of fresh water was thus obtained which though not very palatable was sufficiently good to relieve the thirst of the ship s crew many ships are now regularly supplied

limbs and erect bodies are distinct separate as if they were perfectly chiselled out of the stuff of life static cut off where they are everything is set back as in a clear frosty air their beauty is almost this this strange clean cut isolation as if each one of them would isolate himself still further and for ever from the rest of his fellows yet they are convivial they are almost the only race with the souls of artists still they act the mystery plays with instinctive fullness of interpretation they sing strangely in the mountain fields they love make belief and mummery their processions and religious festivals are profoundly impressive solemn and rapt it is a race that moves on the poles of mystic sensual delight every gesture is a gesture from the blood every expression is a symbolic utterance for learning there is sensuous experience for thought there is myth and drama and dancing and singing everything is of the blood of the senses there is no mind the mind is a suffusion of physical heat it is not separated it is kept submerged at the same time always overhead there is the eternal negative radiance of the snows beneath is life the hot jet of the blood playing elaborately but above is the radiance of changeless not being and life passes away into this changeless radiance summer and the prolific blue and white flowering of the earth goes by with the labour and the ecstasy of man disappears and is gone into brilliance that hovers overhead the radiant cold which waits to receive back again all that which has passed for the moment into being the issue is too much revealed it leaves the peasant no choice the fate gleams transcendent above him the brightness of eternal unthinkable not being and this our life this admixture of labour and of warm experience in the flesh all the time it is steaming up to the changeless brilliance above the light of the everlasting snows this is the eternal issue whether it is singing or dancing or play acting or physical transport of love or vengeance or cruelty or whether it is work or sorrow or religion the issue is always the same at last into the radiant negation of eternity hence the beauty and completeness the finality of the highland peasant his figure his limbs his face his motion it is all formed in beauty and it is all completed there is no flux nor hope nor becoming all is once and for all the issue is eternal timeless and changeless all being and all passing away is part of the issue which is eternal and changeless therefore there is no becoming and no passing away everything is now and for ever hence the strange beauty and finality and isolation of the bavarian peasant it is plain in the crucifixes here is the essence rendered in sculpture of wood the face is blank and stiff almost expressionless one realizes with a start how unchanging and conventionalized is the face of the living man and woman of these parts handsome but motionless as pure form there is also an underlying meanness secretive cruel it is all part of the beauty the pure plastic beauty the body also of the christus is stiff and conventionalized yet curiously beautiful in proportion and in the static tension which makes it unified into one clear thing there is no movement no possible movement the being is fixed finally the whole body is locked in one knowledge beautiful complete it is one with the nails not that it is languishing or dead it is stubborn knowing its own undeniable being sure of the absolute reality of the sensuous experience though he is nailed down upon an irrevocable fate yet within that fate he has the power and the delight of all sensuous experience so he accepts the fate and the mystic delight of the senses with one will he is complete and final his sensuous experience is supreme a consummation of life and death at once it is the same at all times whether it is moving with the scythe on the hill slopes or hewing the timber or steering the raft down the river which is all effervescent with ice whether it is drinking in the gasthaus or making love or playing some mummer s part or hating steadily and cruelly or whether it is kneeling in spellbound subjection in the incense filled church or walking in the strange dark subject procession to bless the fields or cutting the young birch trees for the feast of frohenleichnam it is always the same the dark powerful mystic sensuous experience is the whole of him he is mindless and bound within the absoluteness of the issue the unchangeability of the great icy not being which holds good for ever and

hoping when he took the trouble to break his meditations upon greater things by hopes about himself that he might by and by obtain an appointment as mathematical master in a school a friend procured him a situation as tutor in the house of casimir p rier the salary was good but the duties were too miscellaneous and what was still worse there was an end of the delicious liberty of the garret after a short experience of three weeks comte returned to neediness and contentment he was not altogether without the young man s appetite for pleasure yet when he was only nineteen we find him wondering amid the gaieties of the carnival of how a gavotte or a minuet could make people forget that thirty thousand human beings around them had barely a morsel to eat hardship in youth has many drawbacks but it has the immense advantage over academic ease of making the student s interest in men real and not merely literary towards comte became associated as friend and disciple with a man who was destined to exercise a very decisive influence upon the turn of his speculation henry count of saint simon was second cousin of the famous duke of saint simon the friend of the regent and author of the most important set of memoirs in a language that is so incomparably rich in memoirs he was now nearly sixty and if he had not gained a serious reputation he had at least excited the curiosity and interest of his contemporaries by the social eccentricities of his life by the multitude of his schemes and devices and by the fantastic ingenuity of his political ideas saint simon s most characteristic faculty was an exuberant imagination working in the sphere of real things scientific discipline did nothing for him he had never undergone it and he never felt its value he was an artist in social construction and if right ideas or the suggestion of right ideas sometimes came into his head about history about human progress about a stable polity such ideas were not the products of trains of ordered reasoning they were the intuitional glimpses of the poet and consequently as they professed to be in real matter even the right ideas were as often as not accompanied by wrong ones the young comte now twenty was enchanted by the philosophic veteran in after years he so far forgot himself as to write of saint simon as a depraved quack and to deplore his connection with him as purely mischievous while the connection lasted he thought very differently saint simon is described as the most estimable and lovable of men and the most delightful in his relations he is the worthiest of philosophers even after the association had come to an end and at the very moment when comte was congratulating himself on having thrown off the yoke he honestly admits that saint simon s influence has been of powerful service in his philosophic education i certainly he writes to his most intimate friend am under great personal obligations to saint simon that is to say he helped in a powerful degree to launch me in the philosophical direction that i have now definitely marked out for myself and that i shall follow without looking back for the rest of my life even if there were no such unmistakable expressions as these the most cursory glance into saint simon s writings is enough to reveal the thread of connection between the ingenious visionary and systematic thinker we see the debt and we also see that when it is stated at the highest possible nothing has really been taken either from comte s claims as a powerful original thinker or from his immeasurable pre eminence over saint simon in intellectual grasp and vigour and coherence as high a degree of originality may be shown in transformation as in invention as moli re and shakespeare have proved in the region of dramatic art in philosophy the conditions are not different il faut prendre son bien o on le trouve it is no detriment to comte s fame that some of the ideas which he recombined and incorporated in a great philosophic structure had their origin in ideas that were produced almost at random in the incessant fermentation of saint simon s brain comte is in no true sense a follower of saint simon but it was undoubtedly saint simon who launched him to take comte s own word by suggesting to his strong and penetrating mind the two starting points of what grew into the comtist system first that political phenomena are as capable of being grouped under laws as other phenomena and second that the true destination of philosophy must be social and the true object of the thinker must be the reorganisation of the moral religious and political systems we can readily see what an impulse these far reaching conceptions would give to comte s meditations there were conceptions of less importance than these in which it is impossible not to feel that it was saint simon s wrong or imperfect idea that put his young admirer on the track to a right and perfected idea the subject is not worthy of further discussion that comte would have performed some great intellectual achievement if saint simon had never been born is certain it is hardly less certain that the great achievement which he did actually perform was originally set in motion by saint simon s conversation though it was afterwards directly filiated with the fertile speculations of turgot and condorcet comte thought almost as meanly of plato as he did of saint simon and he considered aristotle the prince of all true thinkers yet their vital difference about ideas did not prevent aristotle from calling plato master after six years the differences between the old and the young philosopher grew too marked for friendship comte began to fret under saint simon s pretensions to

long low building stretching out two irregular wings with deep eaves a sloping gambrel roof and walls which were criss crossed with timber balks in the fashion of the tudors the cheery light of a fire flickered in the broad latticed window to the left of the low porched door and this as it proved marked the study of my uncle for it was thither that i was led by his butler in order to make my host s acquaintance he was cowering over his fire for the moist chill of an english autumn had set him shivering his lamp was unlit and i only saw the red glow of the embers beating upon a huge craggy face with a red indian nose and cheek and deep furrows and seams from eye to chin the sinister marks of hidden volcanic fires he sprang up at my entrance with something of an old world courtesy and welcomed me warmly to rodenhurst at the same time i was conscious as the lamp was carried in that it was a very critical pair of light blue eyes which looked out at me from under shaggy eyebrows like scouts beneath a bush and that this outlandish uncle of mine was carefully reading off my character with all the ease of a practised observer and an experienced man of the world for my part i looked at him and looked again for i had never seen a man whose appearance was more fitted to hold one s attention his figure was the framework of a giant but he had fallen away until his coat dangled straight down in a shocking fashion from a pair of broad and bony shoulders all his limbs were huge and yet emaciated and i could not take my gaze from his knobby wrists and long gnarled hands but his eyes those peering light blue eyes they were the most arrestive of any of his peculiarities it was not their colour alone nor was it the ambush of hair in which they lurked but it was the expression which i read in them for the appearance and bearing of the man were masterful and one expected a certain corresponding arrogance in his eyes but instead of that i read the look which tells of a spirit cowed and crushed the furtive expectant look of the dog whose master has taken the whip from the rack i formed my own medical diagnosis upon one glance at those critical and yet appealing eyes i believed that he was stricken with some mortal ailment that he knew himself to be exposed to sudden death and that he lived in terror of it such was my judgment a false one as the event showed but i mention it that it may help you to realise the look which i read in his eyes my uncle s welcome was as i have said a courteous one and in an hour or so i found myself seated between him and his wife at a comfortable dinner with curious pungent delicacies upon the table and a stealthy quick eyed oriental waiter behind his chair the old couple had come round to that tragic imitation of the dawn of life when husband and wife having lost or scattered all those who were their intimates find themselves face to face and alone once more their work done and the end nearing fast those who have reached that stage in sweetness and love who can change their winter into a gentle indian summer have come as victors through the ordeal of life lady holden was a small alert woman with a kindly eye and her expression as she glanced at him was a certificate of character to her husband and yet though i read a mutual love in their glances i read also mutual horror and recognised in her face some reflection of that stealthy fear which i had detected in his their talk was sometimes merry and sometimes sad but there was a forced note in their merriment and a naturalness in their sadness which told me that a heavy heart beat upon either side of me we were sitting over our first glass of wine and the servants had left the room when the conversation took a turn which produced a remarkable effect upon my host and hostess i cannot recall what it was which started the topic of the supernatural but it ended in my showing them that the abnormal in psychical experiences was a subject to which i had like many neurologists devoted a great deal of attention i concluded by narrating my experiences when as a member of the psychical research society i had formed one of a committee of three who spent the night in a haunted house our adventures were neither exciting nor convincing but such as it was the story appeared to interest my auditors in a remarkable degree they listened with an eager silence and i caught a look of intelligence between them which i could not understand lady holden immediately afterwards rose and left the room sir dominick pushed the cigar box over to me and we smoked for some little time in silence that huge bony hand of his was twitching as he raised it with his cheroot to his lips and i felt that the man s nerves were vibrating like fiddle strings my instincts told me that he was on the verge of some intimate confidence and i feared to speak lest i should interrupt it at last he turned towards me with a spasmodic gesture like a man who throws his last scruple to

brought to the last gasp of endurance it was like the shriek of the hare when the hounds are upon it she clasps her hands and cries out o my god help me there was no voice of any that answered there was no sound of foot fall on the staircase no one entered the door and yet that agonized cry had reached the heart it was meant for the shining ones were with her they stood with faces full of tenderness beaming down upon her they brought her a christmas gift from christ the gift of trust she knew not from whence came the courage and rest that entered her soul but while her little ones stood wondering and silent she turned and drew to herself her well worn bible hands that she did not see guided her as she turned the pages and pointed the words he shall deliver the needy when he crieth the poor also and him that hath no helper he shall spare the poor and needy and shall save the souls of the needy he shall redeem their soul from deceit and violence and precious shall their

consoling presence in the room and her tired heart found rest she wiped away her tears kissed her children and smiled upon them then she rose gathered up her finished work and attired herself to go

close attic room for her darlings and to satisfy all their childish desire for variety and motion she had only the refuge of the streets she was a decent godly woman and the bold manners and evil words of street vagrants were terrible to her and so when the church gates were open for daily morning and evening prayers she had often begged the sexton to let her little ones come in and hear the singing and wander hand in hand around the old church walls he was a kindly old man and the children stealing round like two still bright eyed little mice had gained upon his heart and he made them welcome there it gave the mother a feeling of protection to have them play near the church as if it were a father s house so she put on their little hoods and tippets and led them forth and saw them

discipline as participation in mightier scenes those who write concrete history without ever having taken part in practical politics are one might say in the position of those ancients who wrote about

and passion the rage and tears the many tinted dawn and the blood red sunset of the french revolution and the more a man learns about the details of the revolution the greater is his admiration for mr carlyle s magnificent performance but it is dramatic presentation not social analysis a masterpiece of literature not a scientific investigation a prodigy of poetic insight not a sane and quantitative exploration of the complex processes the deep lying economical fiscal and political conditions that prepared so immense an explosion we have to remember it is true that m taine is not professing to write a history in the ordinary sense his book lies if we may use two very pompous but indispensable words partly in the region of historiography but much more in the region of sociology the study of the french revolution cannot yet be a history of the past for the french still walk per ignes suppositos and the revolution is still some way from being fully accomplished it was the disputes between the roman and the reformed churches which inspired historical research in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries it is the disputes among french parties that now inspire what professes to be historiography but what is really a sort of experimental investigation in the science of society they little know how long and weary a journey lies before them said burke who undertake to bring great masses of men into the political unity of a nation the process is still going on and a man of m taine s lively intellectual sensibility can no more escape its influences than he can escape the ingredients of the air he breathes we may add that if his work had been really historic he must inevitably have gone further back than the eighteenth century for the origins of contemporary france the very slight vague and unsubstantial chapter with which he opens his work cannot be accepted as a substitute for what the subject really demanded a serious summary however condensed and rapid of the various forces accidents deliberate lines of policy which from the breaking up of the great fiefs down to the death of lewis the fourteenth had prepared the distractions of the monarchy under lewis s descendants full of interest as it is m taine s book can hardly be described as containing much that is new or strikingly significant he develops one idea indeed which we have never before seen stated in its present form but which if it implies more than has been often advanced by previous writers in other forms cannot be accepted as true this is perhaps a point better worth discussing than any other which his book raises the rest is a very elaborate and thorough description of the structure of society of its physiognomy in manners and characteristics the privileges the burdens the daily walk and conversation of the various classes which made up the french people between the regency and the revolution m taine s method of description does not strike one as altogether happy it is a common complaint against french historians that they are too lax about their authorities and too heedless about giving us chapter and verse for their assertions m taine goes to the contrary extreme and pours his note books into his text with a steady handed profusion that is excessively fatiguing and makes the result far less effective than it would have been if all this industrious reading had been thoroughly fused and recast into a homogeneous whole it is an ungenerous trick of criticism to disparage good work by comparing it with better but the reader can scarcely help contrasting m taine s overcrowded pages with the perfect assimilation the pithy fulness the pregnant meditation of de tocqueville s book on the same subject when we attempt to reduce m taine s chapters to a body of propositions standing out in definite relief from one another yet conveying a certain unity of interpretation we soon feel how possible it is for an author to have literary clearness along with historic obscurity in another respect we are inclined to question the felicity of m taine s method it does not convey the impression of movement the steps and changes in the conflict among the organs of the old society are not marked in their order and succession the reader is not kept alive to the gradual progress of the break up of old institutions and ideas the sense of an active and ceaseless struggle extending in various stages across the century is effaced by an exclusive attention to the social details of a given phase we need the story you cannot effectively reproduce the true sense and significance of such an epoch as the eighteenth century in france without telling us however barely the tale for example of the long battle of the ecclesiastical factions and the yet more important series of battles between the judiciary and the crown if m taine s book were a piece of abstract social analysis the above remark would not be true but it is a study of the concrete facts of french life and society

sixth annual fair of the pymantoning county agricultural society was in its second day the trotting matches had begun and the vast majority of the visitors had abandoned the other features of the exhibition for this supreme attraction they clustered four or five deep along the half mile of railing that enclosed the track and sat sweltering in the hot september sun on the benching of the grandstand that flanked a stretch of the course boys selling lemonade and peanuts and other boys with the score of the races made their way up and down the seats with shrill cries now and then there was a shriek of girls laughter from a group of young people calling to some other group or struggling for a programme caught back and forth the young fellows shouted to each other jokes that were lost in mid air but for the most part the crowd was a very silent one grimly intent upon the rival sulkies as they flashed by and lost themselves in the clouds that thickened over the distances of the long dusty loop here and there some one gave a shout as a horse broke or settled down to his work under the guttural snarl of his driver at times the whole throng burst into impartial applause as a horse gained or lost a length but the quick throb of the hoofs on the velvety earth and the whir of the flying wheels were the sounds that chiefly made themselves heard the spectacle had the importance which multitude givers and ludlow found in it the effects which he hoped to get again in his impression he saw the deep purples which he looked to see with eyes trained by the french masters of his school to find them and the indigo blues the intense greens the rainbow oranges and scarlets and he knew just how he should give them in the light of that vast afternoon sky cloudless crystalline in its clearness no brilliancy of rendering could be too bold if he had the courage of his convictions this purely american event could be reported on his canvas with all its native character and yet it could be made to appeal to the enlightened eye with the charm of a french subject and impressionism could be fully justified of its follower in pymantoning as well as in paris that golden dust along the track the level tops of the buggies drawn up within its ellipse and the groups scattered about in gypsy gayety on the grass there the dark blur of men behind the barrier the women with their bright hats and parasols massed flower like all made him long to express them in lines and dots and breadths of pure color he had caught the vital effect of the whole and he meant to interpret it so that its truth should be felt by all who had received the light of the new faith in painting who believed in the prismatic colors as in the ten commandments and who hoped to be saved by tone contrasts for the others ludlow was at that day too fanatical an impressionist to care he owed a duty to france no less than to america and he wished to fulfil it in a picture which should at once testify to the excellence of the french method and the american material at twenty two one is often much more secure and final in one s conclusions than one is afterwards he was vexed that a lingering doubt of the subject had kept him from bringing a canvas with him at once and recording his precious first glimpses of it but he meant to come to the trotting match the next day again and then he hoped to get back to his primal impression of the scene now so vivid in his mind he made his way down the benches and out of the enclosure of the track he drew a deep breath full of the sweet smell of the bruised grass forsaken now by nearly all the feet that had trodden it a few old farmers who had failed to get places along the railing and had not cared to pay for seats on the stand were loitering about followed by their baffled and disappointed wives the men occasionally stopped at the cattle pens but it was less to look at the bulls and boars and rams which had taken the premiums and wore cards or ribbons certifying the fact than to escape a consciousness of their partners harassingly taciturn or voluble in their reproach a number of these embittered women brokenly fringed the piazza of the fair house and ludlow made his way toward them with due sympathy for their poor little tragedy so intelligible to him through the memories of his own country bred youth he followed with his pity those who sulked away through the deserted aisles of the building and nursed their grievance among the prize fruits and vegetables and the fruits and vegetables that had not taken the prizes they were more censorious than they would have been perhaps if they had not been defeated themselves he heard them dispute the wisdom of most of the awards as the shoutings and clappings from the racetrack

manner whatever else has happened we have all been photographed with invincible patience and resolution under the direction of colonel barberich in a sunny little court in udine my own manner of testifying must be to tell what i have seen and what i have thought during this extraordinary experience it has been my natural disposition to see this war as something purposeful and epic as it is great as an epoch as the war that will end war but of that last more anon i do not think i am alone in this inclination to a dramatic and logical interpretation the caricatures in the french shops show civilisation and particularly marianne in conflict with a huge and hugely wicked hindenburg ogre well i come back from this tour with something not so simple as that if i were to be tied down to one word for my impression of this war i should say that this war is queer it is not like anything in a really waking world but like something in a dream it hasn t exactly that clearness of light against darkness or of good against ill but it has the quality of wholesome instinct struggling under a nightmare the world is not really awake this vague appeal for explanations to all sorts of people this desire to exhibit the business to get something in the way of elucidation at present missing is extraordinarily suggestive of the efforts of the mind to wake up that will sometimes occur at a deep crisis my memory of this tour i have just made is full of puzzled looking men i have seen thousands of poilus sitting about in cafes by the roadside in tents in trenches thoughtful i have seen alpini sitting restfully and staring with speculative eyes across the mountain gulfs towards unseen and unaccountable enemies i have seen trainloads of wounded staring out of the ambulance train windows as we passed i have seen these dim intimations of questioning reflection in the strangest juxtapositions in malagasy soldiers resting for a spell among the big shells they were hoisting into trucks for the front in a couple of khaki clad maoris sitting upon the step of a horse van in amiens station it is always the same expression one catches rather weary rather sullen inturned the shoulders droop the very outline is a note of interrogation they look up as the privileged tourist of the front in the big automobile or the reserved compartment with his officer or so in charge passes importantly one meets a pair of eyes that seems to say perhaps you understand in which case it is a part i think of this disposition to investigate what makes everyone collect specimens of the war everywhere the souvenir forces itself upon the attention the homecoming permissionaire brings with him invariably a considerable weight of broken objects bits of shell cartridge clips helmets it is a peripatetic museum it is as if he hoped for a clue it is almost impossible i have found to escape these pieces in evidence i am the least collecting of men but i have brought home italian cartridges austrian cartridges the fuse of an austrian shell a broken italian bayonet and a note that is worth half a franc within the confines of amiens but a large heavy piece of exploded shell that had been thrust very urgently upon my attention upon the carso i contrived to lose during the temporary confusion of our party by the arrival and explosion of another prospective souvenir in our close proximity and two really very large and almost complete specimens of some species of ammonites unknown to me from the hills to the east of the adige partially wrapped in a back number of the corriere della sera that were pressed upon me by a friendly officer were unfortunately lost on the line between verona and milan through the gross negligence of a railway porter but i doubt if they would have thrown any very conclusive light upon the war i avow myself an extreme pacifist i am against the man who first takes up the weapon i carry my pacifism far beyond the ambiguous little group of british and foreign sentimentalists who pretend so amusingly to be socialists in the labour leader whose conception of foreign policy is to give germany now a peace that would be no more than a breathing time for a fresh outrage upon civilisation and who would even make heroes of the crazy young assassins of the dublin crime i do not understand those people i do not merely want to stop this war i want to nail down war in its coffin modern war is an intolerable thing it is not a thing to trifle with in this urban district council way it is a thing to end forever i have always hated it so far that is as my imagination enabled me to realise it and now that i have been seeing it sometimes quite closely for a full month i hate it more than ever i never imagined a quarter of its waste its boredom its futility its desolation it is merely a destructive and dispersive instead of a constructive and accumulative industrialism it is a gigantic dusty muddy weedy bloodstained silliness it is the plain duty of every man to give his life and all that he has if by so doing he may help to end it i hate germany which has thrust this experience upon mankind as i hate some horrible infectious disease the new war the war on the modern level is her invention and her crime i perceive that on our side and in its broad outlines this war is nothing more than a gigan

revenge or punishment and a full assumption by humanity of divine responsibilities he would have conferred an incalculable benefit on mankind because these distinctive demands of his are now turning out to be good sense and sound economics i say distinctive because his common humanity and his subjection to time and space that is to the syrian life of his period involved his belief in many things true and false that in no way distinguish him from other syrians of that time but such common beliefs do not constitute specific christianity any more than wearing a beard working in a carpenter s shop or believing that the earth is flat and that the stars could drop on it from heaven like hailstones christianity interests practical statesmen now because of the doctrines that distinguished christ from the jews and the barabbasques generally including ourselves why jesus more than another i do not imply however that these doctrines were peculiar to christ a doctrine peculiar to one man would be only a craze unless its comprehension depended on a development of human faculty so rare that only one exceptionally gifted man possessed it but even in this case it would be useless because incapable of spreading christianity is a step in moral evolution which is independent of any individual preacher if jesus had never existed and that he ever existed in any other sense than that in which shakespear s hamlet existed has been vigorously questioned tolstoy would have thought and taught and quarrelled with the greek church all the same their creed has been fragmentarily practised to a considerable extent in spite of the fact that the laws of all countries treat it in effect as criminal many of its advocates have been militant atheists but for some reason the imagination of white mankind has picked out jesus of nazareth as the christ and attributed all the christian doctrines to him and as it is the doctrine and not the man that matters and as besides one symbol is as good as another provided everyone attaches the same meaning to it i raise for the moment no question as to how far the gospels are original and how far they consist of greek and chinese interpolations the record that jesus said certain things is not invalidated by a demonstration that confucius said them before him those who claim a literal divine paternity for him cannot be silenced by the discovery that the same claim was made for alexander and augustus and i am not just now concerned with the credibility of the gospels as records of fact for i am not acting as a detective but turning our modern lights on to certain ideas and doctrines in them which disentangle themselves from the rest because they are flatly contrary to common practice common sense and common belief and yet have in the teeth of dogged incredulity and recalcitrance produced an irresistible impression that christ though rejected by his posterity as an unpractical dreamer and executed by his contemporaries as a dangerous anarchist and blasphemous madman was greater than his judges was jesus a coward i know quite well that this impression of superiority is not produced on everyone even of those who profess extreme susceptibility to it setting aside the huge mass of inculcated christ worship which has no real significance because it has no intelligence there is among people who are really free to think for themselves on the subject a great deal of hearty dislike of jesus and of contempt for his failure to save himself and overcome his enemies by personal bravery and cunning as mahomet did i have heard this feeling expressed far more impatiently by persons brought up in england as christians than by mahometans who are like their prophet very civil to jesus and allow him a place in their esteem and veneration at least as high as we accord to john the baptist but this british bulldog contempt is founded on a complete misconception of his reasons for submitting voluntarily to an ordeal of torment and death the modern secularist is often so determined to regard jesus as a man like himself and nothing more that he slips unconsciously into the error of assuming that jesus shared that view but it is quite clear from the new testament writers the chief authorities for believing that jesus ever existed that jesus at the time of his death believed himself to be the christ a divine personage it is therefore absurd to criticize his conduct before pilate as if he were colonel roosevelt or admiral von tirpitz or even mahomet whether you accept his belief in his divinity as fully as simon peter did or reject it as a delusion which led him to submit to torture and sacrifice his life without resistance in the conviction that he would presently rise again in glory you are equally bound to admit that far from behaving like a coward or a sheep he showed considerable physical fortitude in going through a cruel ordeal against which he could have defended himself as effectually as he cleared the moneychangers out of the temple gentle jesus meek and mild is a snivelling modern invention with no warrant in the gospels st matthew would as soon have thought of applying such adjectives to judas maccabeus as to jesus and even st luke who makes jesus polite and gracious does not make him meek the picture of him as an english curate of the farcical comedy type too meek to fight a policeman and everybody s butt may be useful in the nursery to soften children but that such a figure could ever have become a centre of the world s attention is too absurd for discussion grown men and women may speak kindly of a harmless creature who utters amiable sentiments and is a helpless nincompoop when he is called on to defend them but they will not follow him nor do what he tells them because they

extremely at the time of their meeting by occupying till the last possible moment a part of the road which she wanted herself on reaching sixty first street she found her way blocked by a lumbering

ran that only two minutes before he had almost robbed himself of this spectacle by going into a moving picture palace mrs porter was annoyed she had never run over anything before except a few chickens and she regarded the incident as a blot on her escutcheon she was incensed with this idiot who had flung himself before her car not reflecting in her heat that he probably had a pre natal

how is it possible to begin at the beginning without beginning at the kettle it appeared as if there were a sort of match or trial of skill you must understand between the kettle and the cricket and this is what led to it and how it came about mrs peerybingle going out into the raw twilight and clicking over the wet stones in a pair of pattens that worked innumerable rough impressions of the first proposition in euclid all about the yard mrs peerybingle filled the kettle at the water butt presently returning less the pattens and a good deal less for they were tall and mrs peerybingle was but short she set the kettle on the fire in doing which she lost her temper or mislaid it for an instant for the water being uncomfortably cold and in that slippy slushy sleety sort of state wherein it seems to penetrate through every kind of substance patten rings included had laid hold of mrs peerybingle s toes and even splashed her legs and when we rather plume ourselves with reason too upon our legs and keep ourselves particularly neat in point of stockings we find this for the moment hard to bear besides the kettle was aggravating and obstinate it wouldn t allow itself to be adjusted on the top bar it wouldn t hear of accommodating itself kindly to the knobs of coal it would lean forward with a drunken air and dribble a very idiot of a kettle on the hearth it was quarrelsome and hissed and spluttered morosely at the fire to sum up all the lid resisting mrs peerybingle s fingers first of all turned topsy turvy and then with an ingenious pertinacity deserving of a better cause dived sideways in down to the very bottom of the kettle and the hull of the royal george has never made half the monstrous resistance to coming out of the water which the lid of that kettle employed against mrs peerybingle before she got it up again it looked sullen and pig headed enough even then carrying its handle with an air of defiance and cocking its spout pertly and mockingly at mrs peerybingle as if it said i won t boil nothing shall induce me but mrs peerybingle with restored good humour dusted her chubby little hands against each other and sat down before the kettle laughing meantime the jolly blaze uprose and fell flashing and gleaming on the little hay maker at the top of the dutch clock until one might have thought he stood stock still before the moorish palace and nothing was in motion but the flame he was on the move however and had his spasms two to the second all right and regular but his sufferings when the clock was going to strike were frightful to behold and when a cuckoo looked out of a trap door in the palace and gave note six times it shook him each time like a spectral voice or like a something wiry plucking at his legs it was not until a violent commotion and a whirring noise among the weights and ropes below him had quite subsided that this terrified hay maker became himself again nor was he startled without reason for these rattling bony skeletons of clocks are very disconcerting in their operation and i wonder very much how any set of men but most of all how dutchmen can have had a liking to invent them there is a popular belief that dutchmen love broad cases and much clothing for their own lower selves and they might know better than to leave their clocks so very lank and unprotected surely now it was you observe that the kettle began to spend the evening now it was that the kettle growing mellow and musical began to have irrepressible gurglings in its throat and to indulge in short vocal snorts which it checked in the bud as if it hadn t quite made up its mind yet to be good company now it was that after two or three such vain attempts to stifle its convivial sentiments it threw off all moroseness all reserve and burst into a stream of song so cosy and hilarious as never maudlin nightingale yet formed the least idea of so plain too bless you you might have understood it like a book better than some books you and i could name perhaps with its warm breath gushing forth in a light cloud which merrily and gracefully ascended a few feet then hung about the chimney corner as its own domestic heaven it trolled its song with that strong energy of cheerfulness that its iron body hummed and stirred upon the fire and the lid itself the recently rebellious lid such is the influence of a bright example performed a sort of jig and clattered like a deaf and dumb young cymbal that had never known the use of its twin brother that this song of the kettle s was a song of invitation and welcome to somebody out of doors to somebody at that moment coming on towards the snug small home and the crisp fire there is no doubt whatever mrs peerybingle knew it perfectly as she sat musing before the hearth it s a dark night sang the kettle and the rotten leaves are lying by the way and above all is mist and darkness and below all is mire and clay and there s only one relief in all the sad and murky air and i don t know that it is one for it s nothing but a glare of deep and angry crimson where the sun and wind together set a brand upon the clouds for being guilty of such weather and the widest open country is a long dull streak of black and there s hoar frost on the finger post and thaw upon the track and the ice it isn t water and the water isn t free and you couldn t say that anything is what it ought to be but he s coming coming coming and here if you like the cricket did chime in with a chirrup chirrup chirrup of such magnitude by way of chorus with a voice so astoundingly disproportionate to its size as compared with the kettle size you couldn t see it that if it had then and there burst itself like an overcharged gun if it had fallen a victim

submitted to his caresses rather for the reason that my mother urged me forward than because of any affection i felt for him frank however would not even permit a kiss the gaunt and grizzled stranger terrified him come here my little man my father said my little man across the space of half a century i can still hear the sad reproach in his voice won t you come and see your poor old father when he comes home from the war my little man how significant that phrase seems to me now the war had in very truth come between this patriot and his sons i had forgotten him the baby had never known him frank crept beneath the rail fence and stood there well out of reach like a cautious kitten warily surveying an alien dog at last the soldier stooped and drawing from his knapsack a big red apple held it toward the staring babe confidently calling now i guess he ll come to his poor old pap home from the war the mother apologized he doesn t know you dick how could he he was only nine months old when you went away he ll go to you by and by the babe crept slowly toward the shining lure my father caught him despite his kicking and hugged him close now i ve got you he exulted then we all went into the little front room and the soldier laid off his heavy army shoes my mother brought a pillow to put under his head and so at last he stretched out on the floor the better to rest his tired aching bones and there i joined him oh belle he said in tones of utter content this is what i ve dreamed about a million times frank and i grew each moment more friendly and soon began to tumble over him while mother hastened to cook something for him to eat he asked for hot biscuits and honey and plenty of coffee that was a mystic hour and yet how little i can recover of it the afternoon glides into evening while the soldier talks and at last we all go out to the barn to watch mother milk the cow i hear him ask about the crops the neighbors the sunlight passes mother leads the way back to the house my father follows carrying little frank in his arms he is a strange man no longer each moment his voice sinks deeper into my remembrance he is my father that i feel ringing through the dim halls of my consciousness harriet clings to his hand in perfect knowledge and confidence we eat our bread and milk the trundle bed is pulled out we children clamber in and i go to sleep to the music of his resonant voice recounting the story of the battles he had seen and the marches he had made the emergence of an individual consciousness from the void is after all the most amazing fact of human life and i should like to spend much of this first chapter in groping about in the luminous shadow of my infant world because deeply considered childish impressions are the fundamentals upon which an author s fictional out put is based but to linger might weary my reader at the outset although i count myself most fortunate in the fact that my boyhood was spent in the midst of a charming landscape and during a certain heroic era of western settlement the men and women of that far time loom large in my thinking for they possessed not only the spirit of adventurers but the courage of warriors aside from the natural distortion of a boy s imagination i am quite sure that the pioneers of still retained something broad and fine in their action something a boy might honorably imitate the earliest dim scene in my memory is that of a soft warm evening i am cradled in the lap of my sister harriet who is sitting on the door step beneath a low roof it is mid summer and at our feet lies a mat of dark green grass from which a frog is croaking the stars are out and above the high hills to the east a mysterious glow is glorifying the sky the cry of the small animal at last conveys to my sister s mind a notion of distress and rising she peers closely along the path starting back with a cry of alarm she calls and my mother hurries out she too examines the ground and at last points out to me a long striped snake with a poor shrieking little tree toad in its mouth the horror of this scene fixes it in my mind my mother beats the serpent with a stick the mangled victim hastens away and the curtain falls i must have been about four years old at this time although there is nothing to de

archbishop of paris namely his nephew paul de gondi titular bishop of corinth in partibus infidelium a younger son of the duke of retz an italian family introduced by catherince de medici there seemed to be a hope that the nobility angered at their own systematic depression and by mazarin s ascendency might make common cause with the parliament and establish some effectual check to the advances of the crown this was the origin of the party called the fronde because the speakers launched their speeches at one another as boys fling stones from a sling fronde in the streets the queen regent was enraged through all her despotic spanish haughtiness at such resistance she tried to step in by the arrest of the foremost members of the opposition but failed and only provoked violent tumults the young prince of conde coming home from germany flushed with victory hated mazarin extremely but his pride as a prince of the blood and his private animosities impelled him to take up the cause of the queen she conveyed her son secretly from paris and the city was in a state of siege for several months however the execution of charles i in england alarmed the queen on the one hand and the parliament on the other as to the consequences of a rebellion provisions began to run short and a vague hollow peace was made in the march of conde now became intolerably overbearing insulted every one and so much offended the queen and mazarin that they caused him his brother and the duke of bouillon to be arrested and imprisoned at vincennes his wife though a cruelly neglected woman whom he had never loved did her utmost to deliver him repaired to bordeaux and gained over the parliament there so that she held out four months against the queen turenne brother to bouillon and as great a general as conde obtained the aid of spaniards and the coadjutor prevailed on the king s uncle gaston duke of orleans to represent that the queen must give way release the princes part with mazarin and even promise to convoke the states general anne still however corresponded with the cardinal and was directed by him in everything distrust and dissension soon broke out conde and the coadjutor quarrelled violently and the royal promises made to both princes and parliament were eluded by the king at fourteen being declared to have attained his majority and thus that all engagements made in his name became void conde went of to guienne and raised an army mazirin returned to the queen paris shut its gates and declared mazarin an outlaw the coadjutor now become cardinal de retz vainly tried to stir up the duke of orleans to take a manly part and mediate between the parties but being much afraid of his own appanage the city of orleans being occupied by either army gaston sent his daughter to take the charge of it as she effectually did but she was far from neutrality being deluded by a hope that conde would divorce his poor faithful wife to marry her turenne on his brother s release had made his peace with the court and commanded the royal army war and havoc raged outside paris within the partisans of the princes stirred the populace to endeavour to intimidate the parliament and municipality into taking their part their chief leader throughout was the duke of beaufort a younger son of the duke of vendome the child of gabrille d estrees he inherited his grandmother s beauty and his grandfather s charm of manner he was the darling of the populace of paris and led them in an aimless sort of way whether there was mischief to be done and the violence and tumult of this latter fronde was far worse than those of the first a terrible battle in the faubourg st antoine broke conde s force and the remnant was only saved by mademoiselle s insisting on their being allowed to pass through paris after one ungrateful attempt to terrify the magistrates into espousing his cause and standing a siege on his behalf conde quitted paris and soon after fell ill of a violent fever his party melted away mazarin saw that tranquillity might be restored if he quitted france for a time the king proclaimed an amnesty but with considerable exceptions and no relaxation of his power and these terms the parliament weary of anarchy and finding the nobles had cared merely for their personal hatreds not for the public good were forced to accept conde on his recovery left france and for a time fought against his country in the ranks of the spaniards beaufort died bravely fighting against the turks at cyprus cardinal de retz was imprisoned and mademoiselle had to retire from court while other less distinguished persons had to undergo the punishment for their resistance though to the credit of the court party be it spoken there were no executions only imprisonments and in after years the fronde was treated as a brief frenzy and forgotten perhaps it may be well to explain that mademoiselle was anne genevieve de bourbon daughter of gaston duke of orleans by his first wife the heiress of the old bourbon branch of montpensier she was the greatest heiress in france and an exceedingly vain and eccentric person aged twenty three at the beginning of the fronde it only remains to say that i have no definite authority for introducing such a character as that of clement darpent but it is well known that there was a strong under current of upright honest and highly cultivated men among the bourgeoisie and magistrates and that it seemed to me quite possible that in the first fronde when the parliament were endeavouring to make a stand for a just right and

in the same breath as being both of them above mere talent and we do not dissent when macaulay after reading burke s works over again exclaims how admirable the greatest man since milton the precise date of burke s birth cannot be stated with certainty all that we can say is that it took place either in or and it is possible that we may set it down in one or the other year as we choose to reckon by the old or the new style the best opinion is that he was born at dublin on the th of january n s his father was a solicitor in good practice and is believed to have been descended from some bourkes of county limerick who held a respectable local position in the time of the civil wars burke s mother belonged to the nagle family which had a strong connection in the county of cork they had been among the last adherents of james ii and they remained firm catholics mrs burke remained true to the church of her ancestors and her only daughter was brought up in the same faith edmund burke and his two brothers garret and richard were bred in the religion of their father but burke never in after times lost a large and generous way of thinking about the more ancient creed of his mother and his uncles in he was sent to school at ballitore a village some thirty miles away from dublin where abraham shackleton a quaker from yorkshire had established himself fifteen years before and had earned a wide reputation as a successful teacher and a good man according to burke he richly deserved this high character it was to abraham shackleton that he always professed to owe whatever gain had come to him from education if i am anything he said many years afterwards it is the education i had there that has made me so his master s skill as a teacher did not impress him more than the example which was every day set before him of uprightness and simplicity of heart thirty years later when burke had the news of shackleton s death i had a true honour and affection he wrote for that excellent man i feel something like a satisfaction in the midst of my concern that i was fortunate enough to have him once under my roof before his departure no man has ever had a deeper or more tender reverence than burke for homely goodness simple purity and all the pieties of life it may well be that this natural predisposition of all characters at once so genial and so serious as his was finally stamped in him by his first schoolmaster it is true that he was only two years at ballitore but two years at that plastic time often build up habits in the mind that all the rest of a life is unable to pull down in burke became a student of trinity college dublin and he remained there until when he took his bachelor s degree these five years do not appear to have been spent in strenuous industry in the beaten paths of academic routine like so many other men of great gifts burke in his youth was desultory and excursive he roamed at large over the varied heights that tempt our curiosity as the dawn of intelligence first lights them up one after another with bewitching visions and illusive magic all my studies burke wrote in when he was in the midst of them have rather proceeded from sallies of passion than from the preference of sound reason and like all other natural appetites have been very violent for a season and very soon cooled and quite absorbed in the succeeding i have often thought it a humorous consideration to observe and sum up all the madness of this kind i have fallen into this two years past first i was greatly taken with natural philosophy which while i should have given my mind to logic employed me incessantly this i call my furor mathematicus but this worked off as soon as i began to read it in the college as men by repletion cast off their stomachs all they have eaten then i turned back to logic and metaphysics here i remained a good while and with much pleasure and this was my furor logicus a disease very common in the days of ignorance and very uncommon in these enlightened times next succeeded the furor historicus which also had its day but is now no more being entirely absorbed in the furor poeticus this is from one of burke s letters to richard shackleton the son of his schoolmaster with whom he had formed one of those close friendships that fill the life of generous youth as ambition fills an energetic manhood many tears were shed when the two boys parted at ballitore and they kept up their intimacy by a steady correspondence they discuss the everlasting dispute as to the ultimate fate of those who never heard the saving name of christ they send one another copies of verses and burke prays for shackleton s judgment on an invocation of his new poem to beauteous nymphs who haunt the dusky wood which hangs recumbent o er the crystal flood burke is warned by shackleton to endeavour to live according to the rules of the gospel and he humbly accepts the good advice with the deprecatory plea that in a town it is difficult to sit down to think seriously it is easier he says to follow the rules of the gospel in the country than at trinity college dublin in the region of profaner things the two friends canvass the comparative worth of sallust and of tully s epistles burke holds for the historian who has he thinks a fine easy diversified narrative mixed with reflection moral and political neither very trite nor obvious nor out of the way and abstract and this is the true beauty of historical observation some pages of verse describe to shackleton how his friend passes the day but the reader will perhaps be content to learn in humbler prose that burke rose with the dawn and strode forth into the country through fragrant gardens and the pride of may until want of breakfast drove him back

afraid i m a wretchedly bad manager she confessed as soon as my next remittance comes i will send you a check when it suits you he said and added thoughtfully one of us should tell your husband about this perhaps it had better be you she smiled for he was now and then boyishly ingenuous he sat directly opposite the gate where all passers by could see him and he had somehow an unfortunate air of being at home in the place yes she said i will write by the first mail i feel less embarrassed because tom told me that if i was ever in any difficulty i might consult you he described you as the right sort and i have found it true i suppose you know that i owe a good deal to your husband andrew answered awkwardly he told me that you and he were in the field hospital together for a time and before then he helped you in some way when you were wounded but he never said much about it what did he do you may smoke while you tell me i think you ought to know because it will show the claim tom has on me andrew lighted a cigarette and began in a disjointed manner for he was not a fluent speaker it was a dazzlingly bright morning and getting very hot our side had been badly cut up in the dark and we were getting back a mixed crowd of stragglers a few miles behind the brigade tom and sergeant carnally the canadian had no proper business with the wreck of my squadron but there they were anyhow only half of us were mounted and when we found ourselves cut off we tried to hold a kopje the horses back in a hollow except mine which was shot as i dismounted i was fond of the poor faithful brute and i suppose that made me savage for i felt that i must get the fellow who killed it he paused and his face hardened there we were lying among the stones with the sun blazing down on us faint puffs of smoke on the opposite rise spirts of sand jumping up where the mauser bullets struck now and then a man dropped his rifle and the rest of us set our teeth it wasn t a spectacular fight and we kept it up in a very informal way two or three commissioned officers dismounted troopers and a few lost line tommies firing as they got a chance the man i wanted had gone to earth beside a big flat stone and i dropped the bullets close about it a hundred yards i made it and the light good i suppose i was so keen on my shooting that i didn t pay much attention when somebody said they were flanking us and the next thing i knew a boer had put a bullet in my leg anyhow i couldn t get up and when i looked round there was no one about then i must have shouted for tom came running back with the sand spirting all round carnally was behind him it looked like certain death but tom got hold of me and dragged me a few yards before carnally came up then we all dropped behind a big stone and i m not clear about the rest somebody had heard the firing and detached a squadron with a gun but i can still picture tom running with his face set through the spirting sand one doesn t forget things like that the blood crept into clare olcott s pale cheeks and her eyes shone no one could have doubted that she admired and loved her absent husband were you not with carnally when he broke out of the prison camp she asked presently i was our guard was friendly and careless and we picked up a hint of a movement we thought our army ought to know about we were caged in behind a very awkward fence but i d found a wire nipper in the sand they were used to cut defense entanglements then we held a council and decided that somebody must break out with the news but while two men might do so more would have no chance to dodge the guard carnally and i were picked and after waiting for a dark night we cut the wire and crawled out close behind a sentry we hadn t seen of course knowing what we did about the boers intentions we couldn t give up our plan mrs olcott recognized that andrew allinson was not the man to abandon a duty though he was unarmed and the sentry carried a magazine rifle well he resumed i crept up and seized the fellow by the leg he dropped his rifle and carnally slipped away we d arranged that if we got out one was not to stop for the other but what happened to you did the boer pick up his rifle no said andrew quietly i got it first but said mrs olcott and stopped andrew smiled you see he had called out when i grabbed him and several of his friends were running up i didn t think he d noticed carnally who had got clear off and there was a chance of its being some time before they missed him then the fellow had shown us one or two small favors given me some tobacco among other things he might have got into trouble for ah said mrs olcott expressively so you let them take you back to prison but what about the canadian he got through safely and they made a fuss over him offered him a commission which he was too sensible to take tom came home promoted and got his west african appointment carnally could have had a commission and you went back to prison though of course they deserved it didn t it strike you that the rewards were not very fairly shared out i believe my people were disappointed when i returned as undistinguished as i went out though i don t know that they were surprised so far as i was concerned it was an inglorious campaign twice in a hospital and some months in a prison camp and yet i ll admit that i left england determined on doing something brilliant mrs olcott made no remark he did not seem to attach much importance to the incident that had secured his comrade s escape his conduct was not of the kind that catches the public eye but her husband whose opinion was worth having believed in allinson well he resumed i ve stayed some time are you

index mankind in the making i the new republic toleration to day is becoming a different thing from the toleration of former times the toleration of the past consisted very largely in saying you are utterly wrong and totally accurst there is no truth but my truth and that you deny but it is not my place to destroy you and so i let you go nowadays there is a real disposition to accept the qualified nature of one s private certainties one may have arrived at very definite views one may have come to beliefs quite binding upon one s self without supposing them to be imperative upon other people to write i believe is not only less presumptuous and aggressive in such matters than to write it is true but it is also nearer the reality of the case one knows what seems true to one s self but we are coming to realize that the world is great and complex beyond the utmost power of such minds as ours every day of life drives that conviction further home and it is possible to maintain that in perhaps quite a great number of ethical social and political questions there is no absolute truth at all at least for finite beings to one intellectual temperament things may have a moral tint and aspect differing widely from that they present to another and yet each may be in its own way right the wide differences in character and quality between one human being and another may quite conceivably involve not only differences in moral obligation but differences in fundamental moral aspect we may act and react upon each other towards a universal end but without any universally applicable rule of conduct whatever in some greater vision than mine my right and wrong may be no more than hammer and anvil in the accomplishment of a design larger than i can understand so that these papers are not written primarily for all nor with the same intention towards all who read them they are designed first for those who are predisposed for their reception then they are intended to display in an orderly manner a point of view and how things look from that point of view to those who are not so predisposed these latter will either develop into adherents as they read or what is more likely they will exchange a vague disorderly objection for a clearly defined and understood difference to arrive at such an understanding is often for practical purposes as good as unanimity for in narrowing down the issue to some central point or principle we develop just how far those who are divergent may go together before separation or conflict become inevitable and save something of our time and of our lives from those misunderstandings and those secondary differences of no practical importance whatever which make such disastrous waste of human energy now the point of view which will be displayed in relation to a number of wide questions in these pages is primarily that of the writer s but he hopes and believes that among those who read what he has to say there will be found not only many to understand but some to agree with him in many ways he is inclined to believe the development of his views may be typical of the sort of development that has gone on to a greater or lesser extent in the minds of many of the younger men during the last twenty years and it is in that belief that he is now presenting them and the questions that will be dealt with in relation to this point of view are all those questions outside a man s purely private self if he have a purely private self in which he interacts with his fellow man our attempt will be to put in order to reduce to principle what is at present in countless instances a mass of inconsistent proceedings to frame a general theory in accordance with modern conditions of social and political activity this is one man s proposal his attempt to supply a need that has oppressed him for many years a need that he has not only found in his own schemes of conduct but that he has observed in the thought of numberless people about him rendering their action fragmentary wasteful in the gross and ineffective in the net result the need for some general principle some leading idea some standard sufficiently comprehensive to be of real guiding value in social and political matters in many doubtful issues of private conduct and throughout the business of dealing with one s fellow men no doubt there are many who do not feel such a need at all and with these we may part company forthwith there are for example those who profess the artistic temperament and follow the impulse of the moment and those who consult an inner light in some entirely mystical manner but neither of these i believe is the most abundant type in the english speaking communities my impression is that with most of the minds i have been able to examine with any thoroughness the attempt to systematize one s private and public conduct alike and to reduce it to spacious general rules to attempt if not to succeed in making it coherent consistent and uniformly directed is an almost instinctive proceeding there is an objection i may anticipate at this point if i am to leave this statement unqualified it would certainly be objected that such a need is no more nor less than the need of religion that a properly formulated religion does supply a trustworthy guide at every fork and labyrinth in life by my allusion to the failure of old formulae and methods to satisfy now i am afraid many people will choose to understand that i refer to what is often spoken of as the conflict of religion and science and that i intend to propound some contribution to the conflict i will at any rate anticipate that objection here in order to mark out my boundaries with greater precision taken in its completeness i submit that it is a greater claim than almost any religion can

write a history in the ordinary sense his book lies if we may use two very pompous but indispensable words partly in the region of historiography but much more in the region of sociology the study of the french revolution cannot yet be a history of the past for the french still walk per ignes suppositos and the revolution is still some way from being fully accomplished it was the disputes between the roman and the reformed churches which inspired historical research in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries it is the disputes among french parties that now inspire what professes to be historiography but what is really a sort of experimental investigation in the science of society they little know how long and weary a journey lies before them said burke who undertake to bring great

ingredients of the air he breathes we may add that if his work had been really historic he must inevitably have gone further back than the eighteenth century for the origins of contemporary france the very slight vague and unsubstantial chapter with which he opens his work cannot be accepted as a substitute for what the subject really demanded a serious summary however condensed and rapid of the various forces accidents deliberate lines of policy which from the breaking up of the great fiefs down to the death of lewis the fourteenth had prepared the distractions of the monarchy under lewis s descendants full of interest as it is m taine s book can hardly be described as containing much that is new or strikingly significant he develops one idea indeed which we have never before seen stated in its present form but which if it implies more than has been often advanced by previous writers in other forms cannot be accepted as true this is perhaps a point better worth discussing than any other which his book raises the rest is a very elaborate and thorough description of the structure of society of its physiognomy in manners and characteristics the privileges the burdens the daily walk and conversation of the various classes which made up the french people between the regency and the revolution m taine s method of description does not strike one as altogether happy it is a common complaint against french historians that they are too lax about their authorities and too heedless about giving us chapter and verse for their assertions m taine goes to the contrary extreme and pours his note books into his text with a steady handed profusion that is excessively fatiguing and makes the result far less effective than it would have been if all this industrious reading had been thoroughly fused and recast into a homogeneous whole it is an ungenerous trick of criticism to disparage good work by comparing it with better but the reader can scarcely help contrasting m taine s overcrowded pages with the perfect assimilation the pithy fulness the pregnant meditation of de tocqueville s book on the same subject when we attempt to reduce m taine s chapters to a body of propositions standing out in definite relief from one another yet conveying a certain unity of interpretation we soon feel how possible it is for an author to have literary clearness along with historic obscurity in another respect we are inclined to question the felicity of m taine s method it does not convey the impression of movement the steps and changes in the conflict among the organs of the old society are not marked in their order and succession the reader is not kept alive to the gradual progress of the break up of old institutions and ideas the sense of an active and ceaseless struggle extending in various stages across the century is effaced by an exclusive attention to the social details of a given phase we need the story you cannot effectively reproduce the true sense and significance of such an epoch as the eighteenth century in france without telling us however barely the tale for example of the long battle of the ecclesiastical factions and the yet more important series of battles between the judiciary and the crown if m taine s book were a piece of abstract social analysis the above remark would not be true but it is a study of the concrete facts of french life and society

ancient priestly garments their green faded look for the red handkerchief blackened as it always was with the snuff stains of a week with which he tried to brush away the fallen grains was quite inefficacious i wished to go in and look at him but i had not the courage to knock i walked away slowly along the sunny side of the street reading all the theatrical advertisements in the shopwindows as i went i found it strange that neither i nor the day seemed in a mourning mood and i felt even annoyed at discovering in myself a sensation of freedom as if i had been freed from something by his death i wondered at this for as my uncle had said the night before he had taught me a great deal he had studied in the irish college in rome and he had taught me to pronounce latin properly he had told me stories about the catacombs and about napoleon bonaparte and he had explained to me the meaning of the different ceremonies of the mass and of the different vestments worn by the priest sometimes he had amused himself by putting difficult questions to me asking me what one should do in certain circumstances or whether such and such sins were mortal or venial or only imperfections his questions showed me how complex and mysterious were certain institutions of the church which i had always regarded as the simplest acts the duties of the priest towards the eucharist and towards the secrecy of the confessional seemed so grave to me that i wondered how anybody had ever found in himself the courage to undertake them and i was not surprised when he told me that the fathers of the church had written books as thick as the post office directory and as closely printed as the law notices in the newspaper elucidating all these intricate questions often when i thought of this i could make no answer or only a very foolish and halting one upon which he used to smile and nod his head twice or thrice sometimes he used to put me through the responses of the mass which he had made me learn by heart and as i pattered he used to smile pensively and nod his head now and then pushing huge pinches of snuff up each nostril alternately when he smiled he used to uncover his big discoloured teeth and let his tongue lie upon his lower lip a habit which had made me feel uneasy in the beginning of our acquaintance before i knew him well as i walked along in the sun i remembered old cotter s words and tried to remember what had happened afterwards in the dream i remembered that i had noticed long velvet curtains and a swinging lamp of antique fashion i felt that i had been very far away in some land where the customs were strange in persia i thought but i could not remember the end of the dream in the evening my aunt took me with her to visit the house of mourning it was after sunset but the window panes of the houses that looked to the west reflected the tawny gold of a great bank of clouds nannie received us in the hall and as it would have been unseemly to have shouted at her my aunt shook hands with her for all the old woman pointed upwards interrogatively and on my aunt s nodding proceeded to toil up the narrow staircase before us her bowed head being scarcely above the level of the banister rail at the first landing she stopped and beckoned us forward encouragingly towards the open door of the dead room my aunt went in and the old woman seeing that i hesitated to enter began to beckon to me again repeatedly with her hand i went in on tiptoe the room through the lace end of the blind was suffused with dusky golden light amid which the candles looked like pale thin flames he had been coffined nannie gave the lead and we three knelt down at the foot of the bed i pretended to pray but i could not gather my thoughts because the old woman s mutterings distracted me i noticed how clumsily her skirt was hooked at the back and how the heels of her cloth boots were trodden down all to one side the fancy came to me that the old priest was smiling as he lay there in his coffin but no when we rose and went up to the head of the bed i saw that he was not smiling there he lay solemn and copious vested as for the altar his large hands loosely retaining a chalice his face was very truculent grey and massive with black cavernous nostrils and circled by a scanty white fur there was a heavy odour in the room the flowers we blessed ourselves and came away in the little room downstairs we found eliza seated in his arm chair in state i groped my way towards my usual chair in the corner while nannie went to the sideboard and brought out a decanter of sherry and some wine glasses she set these on the table and invited us to take a little glass of wine then at her sister s bidding she filled out the sherry into the glasses and passed them to us she pressed me to take some cream crackers also but i declined because i thought i would make too much noise eating them she seemed to be somewhat disappointed at my refusal and went over quietly to the sofa where she sat down behind her sister no one spoke we all gazed at the empty fireplace my aunt waited until eliza sighed and then said ah well he s gone to a better world eliza sighed again and bowed her head in assent my aunt fingered the stem of her wine glass before sipping a little did he peacefully she asked oh quite peacefully ma am said eliza you couldn t tell when the breath went out of him he had a beautiful death god be praised and everything father o rourke was in with him a tuesday and anointed him and prepared him and all he knew then he was quite

bustle in the vicinity of these dwellings in sharp contrast with the still grandeur of the neighboring forests there were canvas covered wagons around which curly headed youngsters were playing several horses were grazing on the short grass and six red and white oxen munched at the hay that had been thrown to them the smoke of many fires curled upward and near the blaze hovered ruddy faced women who stirred the contents of steaming kettles one man swung an axe with a vigorous sweep and the clean sharp strokes rang on the air another hammered stakes into the ground on which to hang a

near some were indifferent and others gazed curiously at the savages two children peeped from behind their mother s skirts as if half curious half frightened from this scene the significance of which had just dawned on him joe turned his eyes again to his companion it was a sweet face he saw one that was sedate but had a promise of innumerable smiles the blue eyes could not long hide flashes of merriment the girl turned and the two young people looked at each other her eyes softened with a woman s gentleness as they rested upon him for broad of shoulder and lithe and strong as a deer stalker he was good to look at listen she said we have known each other only three weeks since you joined our wagon train and have been so kind to me and so helpful to make that long rough ride endurable you have won my regard i i cannot say more even if i would you told me you ran away from your virginian home to seek adventure on the frontier and that you knew no one in all this wild country you even said you could not or would not work at farming perhaps my sister and i are as unfitted as you for this life but we must cling to our uncle because he is the only relative we have he has come out here to join the moravians and to preach the gospel to these indians we shall share his life and help him all we can you have been telling me you you cared for me and now that we are about to part i i don

said he suddenly who is jim my brother tell me of him there s nothing much to tell he and i are all that are left of our people as are you and kate of yours jim s a preacher and the best fellow oh i cared a lot for jim then why did you leave him i was tired of williamsburg i quarreled with a fellow and hurt him besides i wanted to see the west i d like to hunt deer and bear and fight indians oh i m not much good was jim the only one you cared for asked nell smiling she was surprised to find him grave yes except my horse and dog and i had to leave them behind answered joe bowing his head a little you d like to be jim because he s a preacher and could help uncle convert the indians yes partly that but mostly because somehow something you ve said or done has made me care for you in a different way and i d like to be worthy of you i don t think i can believe it when you say you are no good she replied nell he cried and suddenly grasped her hand she wrenched herself free and leaped away from him her face was bright now and the promise of smiles was made good behave yourself sir she tossed her head with a familiar backward motion to throw the chestnut hair from her face and looked at him with eyes veiled slightly under their lashes you will go with kate and me before he could answer a cry from some one on the plain below attracted their attention they turned and saw another wagon train pulling into the settlement the children were shooting and running alongside the weary oxen men and women went forward expectantly that must be the train uncle expected let us go down said nell joe did not answer but followed her down the path when they gained a clump of willows near the cabins he bent forward and took her hand she saw the reckless gleam in his eyes don t they ll see she whispered if that s the only reason you have i reckon i don t care said joe what do you mean i didn t say i didn t tell oh let me go implored nell she tried to release the hand joe had grasped in his broad palm but in vain the more she struggled the firmer was his hold a frown wrinkled her brow and her eyes sparkled with spirit she saw the fur trader s wife looking out of the window and remembered laughing and telling the good woman she did not like this young man it was perhaps because she feared those sharp eyes that she resented his audacity she opened her mouth to rebuke him but no words came joe had bent his head and softly closed her lips with his own for the single instant during which nell stood transfixed as if with surprise and looking up at joe she was dumb usually

fulfilled and had i seen niagara o that i had never heard of niagara till i beheld it blessed were the wanderers of old who heard its deep roar sounding through the woods as the summons to an unknown wonder and approached its awful brink in all the freshness of native feeling had its own mysterious voice been the first to warn me of its existence then indeed i might have knelt down and worshipped but i had come thither haunted with a vision of foam and fury and dizzy cliffs and an ocean tumbling down out of the sky a scene in short which nature had too much good taste and calm simplicity to realize my mind had struggled to adapt these false conceptions to the reality and finding the effort vain a wretched sense of disappointment weighed me down i climbed the precipice and threw myself on the earth feeling that i was unworthy to look at the great falls and careless about beholding them again all that night as there has been and will be for ages past and to come a rushing sound was heard as if a great tempest were sweeping through the air it mingled with my dreams and made them full of storm and whirlwind whenever i awoke and heard this dread sound in the air and the windows rattling as with a mighty blast i could not rest again till looking forth i saw how bright the stars were and that every leaf in the garden was motionless never was a summer night more calm to the eye nor a gale of autumn louder to the ear the rushing sound proceeds from the rapids and the rattling of the casements is but an effect of the vibration of the whole house shaken by the jar of the cataract the noise of the rapids draws the attention from the true voice of niagara which is a dull muffed thunder resounding between the cliffs i spent a wakeful hour at midnight in distinguishing its reverberations and rejoiced to find that my former awe and enthusiasm were reviving gradually and after much contemplation i came to know by my own feelings that niagara is indeed a wonder of the world and not the less wonderful because time and thought must be employed in comprehending it casting aside all preconceived notions and preparation to be dire struck or delighted the beholder must stand beside it in the simplicity of his heart suffering the mighty scene to work its own impression night after night i dreamed of it and was gladdened every morning by the consciousness of a growing capacity to enjoy it yet i will not pretend to the all absorbing enthusiasm of some more fortunate spectators nor deny that very trifling causes would draw my eyes and thoughts from the cataract the last day that i was to spend at niagara before my departure for the far west i sat upon the table rock this celebrated station did not now as of old project fifty feet beyond the line of the precipice but was shattered by the fall of an immense fragment which lay distant on the shore below still on the utmost verge of the rock with my feet hanging over it i felt as if suspended in the open air never before had my mind been in such perfect unison with the scene there were intervals when i was conscious of nothing but the great river rolling calmly into the abyss rather descending than precipitating itself and acquiring tenfold majesty from its unhurried motion it came like the march of destiny it was not taken by surprise but seemed to have anticipated in all its course through the broad lakes that it must pour their collected waters down this height the perfect foam of the river after its descent and the ever varying shapes of mist rising up to become clouds in the sky would be the very picture of confusion were it merely transient like the rage of a tempest but when the beholder has stood awhile and perceives no lull in the storm and considers that the vapor and the foam are as everlasting as the rocks which produce them all this turmoil assumes a sort of calmness it soothes while it awes the mind leaning over the cliff i saw the guide conducting two adventurers behind the falls it was pleasant from that high seat in the sunshine to observe them struggling against the eternal storm of the lower regions with heads bent down now faltering now pressing forward and finally swallowed up in their victory after their disappearance a blast rushed out with an old hat which it had swept from one of their heads the rock to which they were directing their unseen course is marked at a fearful distance on the exterior of the sheet by a jet of foam the attempt to reach it appears both poetical and perilous to a looker on but may be accomplished without much more difficulty or hazard than in stemming a violent northeaster in a few moments forth came the children of the mist dripping and breathless they crept along the base of the cliff ascended to the guide s cottage and received i presume a certificate of their achievement with three verses of sublime poetry on the back my contemplations were often interrupted by strangers who came down from forsyth s to take their first view of the falls a short ruddy middle aged gentleman fresh from old england peeped over the rock and evinced his approbation by a broad grin his spouse a very robust lady afforded a sweet example of maternal solicitude being so intent on the safety of her little boy that she did not even glance at niagara as for the child he gave himself wholly to the enjoyment of a stick of candy another traveller a native american and no rare character among us produced a volume of captain hall s tour and labored earnestly to adjust niagara to the captain s description departing at last

robust and strong the law of descent was however inexorable and on the death of alexis theodore ascended to the throne besides even if it had been possible to choose among the sons of alexis peter was at this time altogether too young to reign for at his father s death he was only about four years old he was born in and his father died in theodore was at this time about sixteen of course however being so young and his health being so infirm he could not take any active part in the administration of government but was obliged to leave every thing in the hands of his counselors and ministers of state who managed affairs as they thought proper though they acted always in theodore s name there were a great many persons who were ambitious of having a share of the power which the young czar thus left in the hands of his subordinates and among these perhaps the most ambitious of all was the princess sophia theodore s sister who was all this time shut up in the convent to which the rules and regulations of imperial etiquette consigned her she was very uneasy in this confinement and wished very much to get released thinking that if she could do so she should be able to make herself of considerable consequence in the management of public affairs so she made application to the authorities to be allowed to go to the palace to see and take care of her brother in his sickness this application was at length complied with and sophia went to the palace here she devoted herself with so much assiduity to the care of her brother watching constantly at his bedside and suffering no one to attend upon him or to give him medicines but herself that she won not only his heart but the hearts of all the nobles of the court by her seemingly disinterested sisterly affection indeed it is not by any means impossible that sophia might have been at first disinterested and sincere in her desire to minister to the wants of her brother and to solace and comfort him in his sickness but however this may have been at the outset the result was that after a time she acquired so much popularity and influence that she became quite an important personage at court she was a very talented and accomplished young woman and was possessed moreover of a strong and masculine character yet she was very agreeable and insinuating in her manners and she conversed so affably and at the same time so intelligently with all the grandees of the empire as they came by turns to visit her brother in his sick chamber that they all formed a very high estimate of her character she also obtained a great ascendency over the mind of theodore himself and this of itself very much increased her importance in the eyes of the courtiers they all began to think that if they wished to obtain any favor of the emperor it was essential that they should stand well with the princess thus every one finding how fast she was rising in influence wished to have the credit of being her earliest and most devoted friend so they all vied with each other in efforts to aid in aggrandizing her things went on in this way very prosperously for a time but at length as might have been anticipated suspicions and jealousies began to arise and after a time the elements of a party opposed to the princess began to be developed these consisted chiefly of the old nobles of the empire the heads of the great families who had been accustomed under the emperors to wield the chief power of the state these persons were naturally jealous of the ascendency which they saw that the princess was acquiring and they began to plot together in order to devise means for restricting or controlling it but besides these nobles there was another very important power at the imperial court at this time namely the army in all despotic governments it is necessary for the sovereign to have a powerful military force under his command to maintain him in his place and it is necessary for him to keep this force as separate and independent as possible from the people there was in russia at this time a very powerful body of troops which had been organized by the emperors and was maintained by them as an imperial guard the name of this body of troops was the strelitz but in order not to encumber the narrative unnecessarily with foreign words i shall call them simply the guards of course a body of troops like these organized and maintained by a despotic dynasty for the express purpose in a great measure of defending the sovereign against his subjects becomes in time a very important element of power in the state the officers form a class by themselves separate from and jealous of the nobles of the country and this state of things has often led to very serious collisions and outbreaks the guards have sometimes proved too strong for the dynasty that created them and have made their own generals the real monarchs of the country when such a state of things as this exists the government which results is called a military despotism this happened in the days of the roman empire the army which was originally formed by the regular authorities of the country and kept for a time in strict subjection to them finally became too powerful to be held any longer under control and they made their own leading general emperor for many successive reigns thus wholly subverting the republic which originally organized and maintained them it was such a military body as this which now possessed great influence and power at moscow the princess sophia knowing how important it would be to her to secure the influence of such a power upon her side paid great attention to the officers and omitted nothing in her power which was calculated to increase her popularity with the whole corps the result was that

some time the rover boys had expected to return to putnam hall and their studies immediately after the winter outing in the adirondacks but an unexpected happening at the institution of learning made them change their plans three pupils were taken down with scarlet fever and rather than run the risk of having more taken sick captain victor putnam had closed up the academy for the time being and sent the pupils to their homes the boys will have to go to some other school their aunt martha had said but one and another had murmured at this for they loved captain putnam too well to desert him so quickly let us wait a few months had been dick s suggestion let us study at home had come from sam let us travel tom had put in travel broadens the mind he loved to be on the go all the time the matter was talked over for several days and tom begged that they might take a trip across the continent and back using some of the money derived from the old treasure at last anderson rover consented

a trifle i got a letter in chicago as you know it was from dora stanhope and she said that she and her mother were traveling again and expected to go either to santa barbara or los angeles her mother is not well again and the doctor thought the air on the pacific coast might benefit her oh my but won t dick have an elegant time if he falls in with dora cried sam tom we won t be in it now don t you

secret shouted sam not much dick let us in on it at once yes do put in tom but it may prove a disappointment we ll chance it returned tom well then dora wrote that if she and her mother could find a

uttered the last words as the carriage came to a stop at the curb he leaped out and so did the others and a few minutes later found them safe and sound in the hotel they were assigned to a large room on the third floor and hither they made their way followed by their trunks and then began to wash and dress up preparatory to going down to the dining room for the journeying around since breakfast had made them hungry i think i am going to like san francisco said tom as he was adjusting a fresh collar and gazing out of the window at the same time everything looks so bright and clean they have some pretty tall buildings here the same as in chicago and new york came from dick as he too gazed out of the window oh all the big cities are a good deal alike put in sam who was drying his face on a

cognisant of personal traits and minor peculiarities it is furthermore exerted to a far greater extent upon mental and moral as well as physical peculiarities in the individual we cannot fall in love with everybody alike some of us fall in love with one person some with another this instinctive and deep seated differential feeling we may regard as the outcome of complementary features mental moral

from marrying his grandmother moralists have always borne a special grudge to pretty faces but as mr herbert spencer admirably put it long before the appearance of darwin s selective theory the saying that beauty is but skin deep is itself but a skin deep saying in reality beauty is one of the very best guides we can possibly have to the desirability so far as race preservation is concerned of any man or any woman as a partner in marriage a fine form a good figure a beautiful bust a round arm and neck a fresh complexion a lovely face are all outward and visible signs of the physical qualities that on the whole conspire to make up a healthy and vigorous wife and mother they imply soundness fertility a good circulation a good digestion conversely sallowness and paleness are roughly indicative of dyspepsia and an mia a flat chest is a symptom of deficient maternity and what we call a bad figure is really in one way or another an unhealthy departure from the central norma and standard of the race good teeth mean good deglutition a clear eye means an active liver scrubbiness and undersizedness mean feeble virility nor are indications of mental and moral efficiency by any means wanting as recognised elements in personal beauty a good humoured face is in itself almost pretty a pleasant smile half redeems unattractive features low receding foreheads strike us

time with another when we take an extended range of cases may i think be almost demonstrated by sure and certain warranty of human nature brothers and sisters have more in common mentally and physically than any other members of the same race can possibly have with one another but nobody falls in love with his sister a profound instinct has taught even the lower races of men for the most

nature upon the offspring by cutting off the idiots the consumptives the weaklings and the cripples who often result from such consanguineous marriages in narrow communities where breeding in and in becomes almost inevitable natural selection has similarly to exert itself upon a crowd of cr tins and other hapless incapables but in wide and open champaign countries where individual choice has free room for exercise men and women as a rule if not constrained by parents and moralists marry for love and marry on the whole their natural complements they prefer outsiders fresh blood somebody who comes from beyond the community to the people of their own immediate surroundings in many men the dislike to marrying among the folk with whom they have been brought up amounts almost to a positive instinct they feel it as impossible to fall in love with a fellow townswoman as to fall in love with their own first cousins among exogamous tribes such an instinct aided of course by other extraneous causes has hardened into custom and there is reason to believe from the universal traces among the higher civilisations of marriage by capture that all the leading races of the world are ultimately derived from exogamous ancestors possessing this healthy and excellent sentiment in minor matters it is of course universally admitted that short men as a rule prefer tall women while tall men admire

the rover boys had gone to find their long lost father after this the boys made a trip west to establish their parent s claim to the gold mine just mentioned and this was followed by a grand trip on the great lakes in which the boys suffered not a little at the hands of the baxters on an island on one of the lakes the rover boys found a curious casket and this on being opened proved to contain some directions for locating a treasure secreted in the heart of the adirondack mountains we must locate that treasure said tom rover and off they started for the mountains and did locate it at last but not before dan baxter had done everything in his power to locate it ahead of them when they finally outwitted their enemy dan baxter had disappeared and that was the last they had seen of him for some time the rover boys had expected to return to putnam hall and their studies immediately after the winter outing in the adirondacks but an unexpected happening at the institution of learning made them change their plans three pupils were taken down with scarlet fever and rather than run the risk of having more taken sick captain victor putnam had closed up the academy for the time being and sent the pupils to their homes the boys will have to go to some other school their aunt martha had said but one and another had murmured at this for they loved captain putnam too well to desert him so quickly let us wait a few months had been dick s suggestion let us study at home had come from sam let us travel tom had put in travel broadens the mind he loved to be on the go all the time the matter was talked over for several days and tom begged that they might take a trip across the continent and back using some of the money derived from the old treasure at last anderson rover consented and two days later the three boys were off going by way of new york city on the chicago limited they had spent two days in the great city by the lakes and then come direct to the golden gate city i wonder if we will meet anybody we know while we are out here said tom as the carriage continued on its way if we get down to santa barbara i think we ll meet somebody answered dick and he blushed just a trifle i got a letter in chicago as you know it was from dora stanhope and she said that she and her mother were traveling again and expected to go either to santa barbara or los angeles her mother is not well again and the doctor thought the air on the pacific coast might benefit her oh my but won t dick have an elegant time if he falls in with dora cried sam tom we won t be in it now don t you start to tease me returned dick his face redder than ever i guess dora always gave you a good time too that s right she did said tom and then he added did she say anything about the lanings for the laning girls nellie and grace were cousins to dora stanhope and tom and sam thought almost as much of them as dick did of dora to be sure she did replied dick but i guess it s well it s a secret a secret shouted sam not much dick let us in on it at once yes do put in tom but it may prove a disappointment we ll chance it returned tom well then dora wrote that if she and her mother could find a nice cottage at los angeles or santa barbara they were going to invite nellie and grace to come out and keep house with them for six months or so hurrah cried sam enthusiastically i hope they come if they do won t the six of us just have boss times and his face glowed with anticipation we can certainly have good times if mrs stanhope s health will permit said dick here we are at the hotel he uttered the last words as the carriage came to a stop at the curb he leaped out and so did the others and a few minutes later found them safe and sound in the hotel they were assigned to a large room on the third floor and hither they made their way followed by their trunks and then began to wash and dress up preparatory to going down to the dining room for the journeying around since breakfast had made them hungry i think i am going to like san francisco said tom as he was adjusting a fresh collar and gazing out of the window at the same time everything looks so bright and clean they have some pretty tall buildings here the same as in chicago and new york came from dick as he too gazed out of the window oh all the big cities are a good deal alike put in sam who was drying his face on a towel san francisco is a mighty rich place continued tom they are too rich even to use pennies it s five cents here or a bit there or two bits for this and two bits for that i never heard a quarter called two bits in new york i ve been told that is a southern expression and one used in the west indies said dick the early californians my gracious dick broke off short and leaned far out of the window which they had opened to let in the fresh spring air what s up queried tom don t fall out and he caught his elder brother by the arm i must have been mistaken but it did look like him said dick slowly look like whom asked sam joining the pair dan baxter dan baxter here shouted the others i am pretty sure it was dan baxter where is he asked tom he is gone now he just disappeared around the hotel corner well if it really was dan baxter we want to keep our eyes open was sam s comment chapter ii the turning up of dan baxter the boys were very curious concerning their old enemy and on going

person who inhales its fumes to become clairvoyant or to dream dreams whichever the truth may be it was used for this purpose in the mystical ceremonies of the kendah religion when under its influence the priestess or oracle of the ivory child was wont to announce divine revelations during her tenure of this office lady ragnall was frequently subjected to the spell of the taduki vapour and said strange things some of which i heard with my own ears also myself once i experienced its effects and saw a curious vision whereof many of the particulars were afterwards translated into facts now the conversation which i have mentioned was shortly to the effect that she lady ragnall believed a time would come when she or i or both of us were destined to imbibe these taduki fumes and see wonderful pictures of some past or future existence in which we were both concerned this knowledge she declared had come to her while she was officiating in an apparently mindless condition as the priestess of the kendah god called the ivory child at the time i did not think it wise to pursue so exciting a subject with a woman whose mind had been recently unbalanced and afterwards in the stress of new experiences i forgot all about the matter or at any rate only thought of it very rarely once however it did recur to me with some force shortly after i came to england to spend my remaining days far from the temptations of adventure i was beguiled into becoming a steward of a charity dinner and what was worse into attending the said dinner although its objects were admirable it proved one of the most dreadful functions in which i was ever called upon to share there was a vast number of people some of them highly distinguished who had come to support the charity or to show off their orders i don t know which and others like myself not at all distinguished just common subscribers who had no orders and stood about the crowded room like waiters looking for a job at the dinner which was very bad i sat at a table so remote that i could hear but little of the interminable speeches which was perhaps fortunate for me in these circumstances i drifted into conversation with my neighbour a queer wizened black bearded man who somehow or other had found out that i was acquainted with the wilder parts of africa he proved to be a wealthy scientist whose passion it was to study the properties of herbs especially of such as grow in the interior of south america where he had been travelling for some years presently he mentioned a root named yag known to the indians which when pounded up into a paste and taken in the form of pills had the effect of enabling the patient to see events that were passing at a distance indeed he alleged that a vision thus produced had caused him to return home since in it he saw that some relative of his i think a twin sister was dangerously ill in fact however he might as well have stayed away as he only arrived in london on the day after her funeral as i saw that he was really interested in the subject and observed that he was a very temperate man who did not seem to be romancing i told him something of my experiences with taduki to which he listened with a kind of rapt but suppressed excitement when i affected disbelief in the whole business he differed from me almost rudely asking why i rejected phenomena simply because i was too dense to understand them i answered perhaps because such phenomena were inconvenient and upset one s ideas to this he replied that all progress involved the upsetting of existent ideas moreover he implored me if the chance should ever come my way to pursue experiments with taduki fumes and let him know the results here our conversation came to an end for suddenly a band that was braying near by struck up god save the queen and we hastily exchanged cards and parted i only mention it because had it not occurred i think it probable that i should never have been in a position to write this history the remarks of my acquaintance remained in my mind and influenced it so much that when the occasion came i did as a kind of duty what however much i was pressed i am almost sure i should never have done for any other reason just because i thought that i ought to take an opportunity of trying to discover what was the truth of the matter as it chanced it was quick in coming here i should explain that i attended the dinner of which i have spoken not very long after a very lengthy absence from england whither i had come to live when king solomon s mines had made me rich therefore it happened that between the conclusion of my kendah adventure some years before and this time i saw nothing and heard little of lord and lady ragnall once a rumour did reach me however i think through sir henry curtis or captain good that the former had died as a result of an accident what the accident was my informant did not know and as i was just starting on a far journey at the time i had no opportunity of making inquiries my talk with the botanical scientist determined me to do so indeed a few days later i discovered from a book of reference that lord ragnall was dead leaving no heir also that his wife survived him i was working myself up to write to her when one morning the postman brought me here at the grange a letter which had ragnall castle printed on the flap of the envelope i did not know the writing which was very clear and firm for as it chanced to the best of my recollection i had never seen that of lady ragnall here is a copy of the letter it contained my dear mr quatermain

it was a building of the medium size and unpretending the facade being of stone and of the italian elevation made familiar by inigo jones and his school there was a doorway to the lawn standing at the head of a flight of steps the shutters of the house were closed and the blinds of the bedrooms drawn down her perception of the fact that no crusty caretaker could see her from the windows led her at once to slacken her pace and stroll through the flower beds coolly a house unblinded is a possible spy and must be treated accordingly a house with the shutters together is an insensate heap of stone and mortar to be faced with indifference on the other side of the house the greensward rose to an eminence whereon stood one of those curious summer shelters sometimes erected on exposed points of view called an all the year round in the present case it consisted of four walls radiating from a centre like the arms of a turnstile with seats in each angle so that whencesoever the wind came it was always possible to find a screened corner from which to observe the landscape the milkmaid s trackless course led her up the hill and past this erection at ease as to being watched and scolded as an intruder her mind flew to other matters till at the moment when she was not a yard from the shelter she heard a foot or feet scraping on the gravel behind it some one was in the all the year round apparently occupying the seat on the other side as was proved when on turning she saw an elbow a man s elbow projecting over the edge now the young woman did not much like the idea of going down the hill under the eyes of this person which she would have to do if she went on for as an intruder she was liable to be called back and questioned upon her business there accordingly she crept softly up and sat in the seat behind intending to remain there until her companion should leave this he by no means seemed in a hurry to do what could possibly have brought him there what could detain him there

track of his feet in the dewy grass forming a line from the house steps which announced that he was an inhabitant and not a chance passer by at last she peeped round chapter ii a fine framed dark mustachioed gentleman in dressing gown and slippers was sitting there in the damp without a hat on with one hand he was tightly grasping his forehead the other hung over his knee the attitude bespoke with sufficient clearness a mental condition of anguish he was quite a different being from any of the men to whom her eyes were accustomed she had never seen mustachios before for they were not worn by civilians in lower wessex at this date his hands and his face were white to her view deadly white and he heeded nothing outside his own existence there he remained as motionless as the bushes around him indeed he scarcely seemed to breathe having imprudently advanced thus far margery s wish was to get back again in the same unseen manner but in moving her foot for the purpose it grated on the gravel he started up with an air of bewilderment and slipped something into the pocket of his dressing gown she was almost certain that it was a pistol the pair stood looking blankly at each other my gott who are you he asked sternly and with not altogether an english articulation what do you do here margery had already begun to be frightened at her boldness in invading the lawn and pleasure seat the house had a master and she had not known of it my name is margaret tucker sir she said meekly my father is dairyman tucker we live at silverthorn dairy house what were you doing here at this hour of the morning she told him even to the fact that she had climbed over the fence and what made you peep round at me i saw your elbow sir and i wondered what you were doing and what was i doing nothing you had one hand on your forehead and the other on your knee i do hope you are not ill sir or in deep trouble margery had sufficient tact to say nothing about the pistol what difference would it make to you if i were ill or in trouble you don t know me she returned no answer feeling that she might have taken a liberty in expressing sympathy but looking furtively up at him she discerned to her surprise that he seemed affected by her humane wish simply as it had been expressed she had scarcely conceived that such a tall dark man could know what gentle feelings were well i am much obliged to you for caring how i am said he with a faint smile and an affected lightness of manner which even to her only rendered more apparent the gloom beneath i have not slept this past night i suffer from sleeplessness probably you do not margery laughed a little and he glanced with interest at the comely picture she presented her fresh face brown hair candid eyes unpractised manner country dress pink

the same deference which the business end paid to seniority in march himself but in fact fulkerson s forehead was getting as he said more intellectual every day and the years were pushing them all along together still march had kept on in the old rut and one day he fell down in it he had a long sickness and when he was well of it he was so slow in getting his grip of work again that he was sometimes deeply discouraged his wife shared his depression whether he showed or whether he hid it and when the doctor advised his going abroad she abetted the doctor with all the strength of a woman s hygienic intuitions march himself willingly consented at first but as soon as he got strength for his work he began to temporize and to demur he said that he believed it would do him just as much good to go to saratoga where they always had such a good time as to go to carlsbad and mrs march had been obliged several times to leave him to his own undoing she always took him more vigorously in hand afterwards ii when he got home from the every other week office the afternoon of that talk with the business end he wanted to laugh with his wife at fulkerson s notion of a sabbatical year she did not think it was so very droll she even urged it seriously against him as if she had now the authority of holy writ for forcing him abroad she found no relish of absurdity in the idea that it was his duty to take this rest which had been his right before he abandoned himself to a fancy which had been working to the surface of his thought we could call it our silver wedding journey and go round to all the old places and see them in the reflected light of the past oh we could she responded passionately and he had now the delicate responsibility of persuading her that he was joking he could think of nothing better than a return to fulkerson s absurdity it would be our silver wedding journey just as it would be my sabbatical year a good deal after date but i suppose that would make it all the more silvery she faltered in her elation didn t you say a sabbatical year yourself she demanded fulkerson said it but it was a figurative expression and i suppose the silver wedding journey was a

course it is ridiculous and do something entirely fresh it wouldn t work it would be carrying water on both shoulders the fiction would kill the travel the travel would kill the fiction the love and

when anything occurred to him that amused him and she demanded what is it nothing i was wishing we could go in the consciousness of people who actually hadn t been before carry them all through europe and let them see it in the old simple hearted american way she shook her head you couldn t they ve all been all but about sixty or seventy millions said march well those are just the millions you don t know and couldn t imagine i m not so sure of that and even if you could imagine them you couldn t make them interesting all the interesting ones have been anyway some of the uninteresting ones too i used to meet some of that sort over there i believe i would rather chance it for my pleasure with those that hadn t been then why not do it i know you could get something out of it it might be a good

their party it was not fair to him to pretend that the atmosphere was a liberal and inquiring one when the young man who had sat still and dormant by the table was in reality a keen and bitter irish roman catholic then the question a question begging question was put quite suddenly without preparation or prelude by surprise why bishop was the spermaticos logos identified with the second and not the third person of the trinity it was indiscreet it was silly to turn upon the speaker and affect an air of disengagement and modernity and to say ah that indeed is the unfortunate aspect of the

utmost familiarity of almost unspeakable things there had been even attempts at epigram athanasian epigrams bent the novelist had doubted if originally there had been a third person in the trinity at all he suggested a reaction from a too manichaean dualism at some date after the time of st john s gospel he maintained obstinately that that gospel was dualistic the unpleasant quality of the talk was far more manifest in the retrospect than it had been at the time it had seemed then bold and strange but not impossible now in the cold darkness it seemed sacrilegious and the bishop s share which was indeed only the weak yielding of a tired man to an atmosphere he had misjudged became a disgraceful display of levity and bad faith they had baited him some one had said that nowadays every one was an arian knowingly or unknowingly they had not concealed their conviction that the bishop did not really believe in the creeds he uttered and that unfortunate first admission stuck terribly in his

above or below there must be a switch the switch was found grasped and turned the darkness fled in a mirror the sleeper saw the reflection of his face and a corner of the bed in which he lay the lamp

the anakim it had a canopy with yellow silk curtains surmounted by a gilded crown of carved wood between the curtains was a man s face clean shaven pale with disordered brown hair and weary pale blue eyes he was clad in purple pyjamas and the hand that now ran its fingers through the brown hair was long and lean and shapely beside the bed was a convenient little table bearing the light a water bottle and glass a bunch of keys a congested pocket book a gold banded fountain pen and a gold watch that indicated a quarter past three on the lower edge of the picture in the mirror appeared the back of a gilt chair over which a garment of peculiar construction had been carelessly thrown it was in the form of that sleeveless cassock of purple opening at the side whose lower flap is called a bishop s apron the corner of the frogged coat showed behind the chair back and the sash lay crumpled on the floor black doeskin breeches still warmly lined with their pants lay where they had been thrust off at the corner of the bed partly covering black hose and silver buckled shoes for a moment the tired gaze of the man in the bed rested upon these evidences of his episcopal dignity then he

hands of m moser the well known manager lady frances as he informed me had stayed there for several weeks she had been much liked by all who met her her age was not more than forty she was still handsome and bore every sign of having in her youth been a very lovely woman m moser knew nothing of any valuable jewellery but it had been remarked by the servants that the heavy trunk in the lady s bedroom was always scrupulously locked marie devine the maid was as popular as her mistress she was actually engaged to one of the head waiters in the hotel and there was no difficulty in getting her address it was rue de trajan montpellier all this i jotted down and felt that holmes himself could not have been more adroit in collecting his facts only one corner still remained in the shadow no light which i possessed could clear up the cause for the lady s sudden departure she was very happy at lausanne there was every reason to believe that she intended to remain for the season in her luxurious rooms overlooking the lake and yet she had left at a single day s notice which involved her in the useless payment of a week s rent only jules vibart the lover of the maid had any suggestion to offer he connected the sudden departure with the visit to the hotel a day or two before of a tall dark bearded man un sauvage un veritable sauvage cried jules vibart the man had rooms somewhere in the town he had been seen talking earnestly to madame on the promenade by the lake then he had called she had refused to see him he was english but of his name there was no record madame had left the place immediately afterwards jules vibart and what was of more importance jules vibart s sweetheart thought that this call and the departure were cause and effect only one thing jules would not discuss that was the reason why marie had left her mistress of that he could or would say nothing if i wished to know i must go to montpellier and ask her so ended the first chapter of my inquiry the second was devoted to the place which lady frances carfax had sought when she left lausanne concerning this there had been some secrecy which confirmed the idea that she had gone with the intention of throwing someone off her track otherwise why should not her luggage have been openly labelled for baden both she and it reached the rhenish spa by some circuitous route this much i gathered from the manager of cook s local office so to baden i went after dispatching to holmes an account of all my proceedings and receiving in reply a telegram of half humorous commendation at baden the track was not difficult to follow lady frances had stayed at the englischer hof for a fortnight while there she had made the acquaintance of a dr shlessinger and his wife a missionary from south america like most lonely ladies lady frances found her comfort and occupation in religion dr shlessinger s remarkable personality his whole hearted devotion and the fact that he was recovering from a disease contracted in the exercise of his apostolic duties affected her deeply she had helped mrs shlessinger in the nursing of the convalescent saint he spent his day as the manager described it to me upon a lounge chair on the veranda with an attendant lady upon either side of him he was preparing a map of the holy land with special reference to the kingdom of the midianites upon which he was writing a monograph finally having improved much in health he and his wife had returned to london and lady frances had started thither in their company this was just three weeks before and the manager had heard nothing since as to the maid marie she had gone off some days beforehand in floods of tears after informing the other maids that she was leaving service forever dr shlessinger had paid the bill of the whole party before his departure by the way said the landlord in conclusion you are not the only friend of lady frances carfax who is inquiring after her just now only a week or so ago we had a man here upon the same errand did he give a name i asked none but he was an englishman though of an unusual type a savage said i linking my facts after the fashion of my illustrious friend exactly that describes him very well he is a bulky bearded sunburned fellow who looks as if he would be more at home in a farmers inn than in a fashionable hotel a hard fierce man i should think and one whom i should be sorry to offend already the mystery began to define itself as figures grow clearer with the lifting of a fog here was this good and pious lady pursued from place to place by a sinister and unrelenting figure she feared him or she would not have fled from lausanne he had still followed sooner or later he would overtake her had he already overtaken her was that the secret of her continued silence could the good people who were her companions not screen her from his violence or his blackmail what horrible purpose what deep design lay behind this long pursuit there was the problem which i had to solve to holmes i wrote showing how rapidly and surely i had got down to the roots of the matter in reply i had a telegram asking for a description of dr shlessinger s left ear holmes s ideas of humour are strange and occasionally offensive so i took no notice of his ill timed jest indeed i had already reached montpellier in my pursuit of the maid marie before his message came i had no difficulty in finding the ex servant and in learning all that she could tell me she was a devoted creature who had only left her mistress because she was sure that she was in good hands and because her own approaching marriage made a separation inevitable in any case her mistress had as she confesse

of dislike i wonder why he did it whispered mary louise who had overheard the exchange of words and marked kasker s dogged opposition he bought the bonds as a matter of business replied laura hilton

has ceased to be a nation in itself and it will perhaps never again have anything like a national literature but that was something like a national literature and it will probably be centuries yet before the life of the whole country the american life as distinguished from the new england life shall have anything so like a national literature it will be long before our larger life interprets itself in such imagination as hawthorne s such wisdom as emerson s such poetry as longfellow s such prophecy as whittier s such wit and grace as holmes s such humor and humanity as lowell s the literature of those great men was if i may suffer myself the figure the socinian graft of a calvinist stock their faith in its varied shades was unitarian but their art was puritan so far as it was imperfect and great and beautiful as it was i think it had its imperfections it was marred by the intense ethicism that pervaded the new england mind for two hundred years and that still characterizes it they or their fathers had broken away from orthodoxy in the great schism at the beginning of the century but as if their heterodoxy were conscience stricken they still helplessly pointed the moral in all they did some pointed it more directly some less directly but they all pointed it i should be far from blaming them for their ethical intention though i think they felt their vocation as prophets too much for their good as poets sometimes they sacrificed the song to the sermon though not always nor nearly always it was in poetry and in romance that they excelled in the novel so far as they attempted it they failed i say this with the names of all the bostonian group and those they influenced in mind and with a full sense of their greatness it may be ungracious to say that they have left no heirs to their peculiar greatness but it would be foolish to say that they left an estate where they had none to bequeath one cannot take account of such a fantasy as judd s margaret the only new englander who has attempted the novel on a scale proportioned to the work of the new englanders in philosophy in poetry in romance is mr de forest who is of new haven and not of boston i do not forget the fictions of doctor holmes or the vivid inventions of doctor hale but i do not call them novels and i do not forget the exquisitely realistic art of miss jewett or miss wilkins which is free from the ethicism of the great new england group but which has hardly the novelists s scope new england in hawthorne s work achieved supremacy in romance but the romance is always an allegory and the novel is a picture in which the truth to life is suffered to do its unsermonized office for conduct and new england yet lacks her novelist because it was her instinct and her conscience in fiction to be true to an ideal of life rather than to life itself even when we come to the exception that proves the rule even to such a signal exception as uncle tom s cabin i think that what i say holds true that is almost the greatest work of imagination that we have produced in prose and it is the work of a new england woman writing from all the inspirations and traditions of new england it is like begging the question to say that i do not call it a novel however but really is it a novel in the sense that war and peace is a novel or madame flaubert or l assommoir or phineas finn or dona perfecta or esther waters or marta y maria or the return of the native or virgin soil or david grieve in a certain way it is greater than any of these except the first but its chief virtue or its prime virtue is in its address to the conscience and not its address to the taste to the ethical sense not the aesthetical sense this does not quite say the thing but it suggests it and i should be sorry if it conveyed to any reader a sense of slight for i believe no one has felt more deeply than myself the value of new england in literature the comparison of the literary situation at boston to the literary situation at edinburgh in the times of the reviewers has never seemed to me accurate or adequate and it holds chiefly in the fact that both seem to be of the past certainly new york is yet no london in literature and i think boston was once vastly more than edinburgh ever was at least in quality the scotch literature of the palmy days was not wholly scotch and even when it was rooted in scotch soil it flowered in the air of an alien speech but the new england literature of the great day was the blossom of a new england root and the language which the bostonians wrote was the native english of scholars fitly the heirs of those who had brought the learning of the universities to massachusetts bay two hundred years before and was of as pure a lineage as the english of the mother country iii the literary situation which confronted me when i came to boston was then as native as could well be and whatever value i may be able to give a personal study of it will be from the effect it made upon me as one strange in everything but sympathy i will not pretend that i saw it in its entirety and i have no hope of presenting anything like a kinetoscopic impression of it what i can do is to give here and there a glimpse of it and i shall wish the reader to keep in mind the fact that it was in a state of transition as everything is always and everywhere it was no sooner recognizably native than it ceased to be fully so and i became a witness of it after the change had begun the publishing house which so long embodied new england literature was already attempting enterprises out of the line of its traditions and one of these had brought mr t b aldrich from new york a few weeks before i arrived upon the scene in that dramatic quality which i think neve

great contributes to the effect a trifle of information comes from the french foreign office archives french printed memoires and letters neglected by previous english writers on the subject offer some valuable indeed essential hints and illustrate charles s relations with the wits and beauties of the reign of louis xv by combining information from these and other sources in print manuscript and tradition we reach various results we can now follow and understand the changes in the singular and wretched development of the character of prince charles edward stuart we get a curious view of the manners and a lurid light on the diplomacy of the middle of the eighteenth century we go behind the scenes of many conspiracies above all we encounter an extraordinary personage the great highborn highland chief who sold himself as a spy to the english government his existence was suspected by scott if not clearly known and understood in his introduction to redgauntlet sir walter scott says that the ministers of george iii thought it proper to leave dr cameron s new schemes in concealment lest by divulging them they had indicated the channel of communication which it is now well known they possessed to all the plots of charles edward to indicate that secret channel of communication between the government of the pelhams and the jacobite conspirators of is one purpose of this book tradition has vaguely bequeathed to us the name of pickle the spy the foremost of many traitors who pickle was and what he did a whole romance of prosperous treachery is now to be revealed and illustrated from various sources pickle was not only able to keep the duke of newcastle and george ii well informed as to the inmost plots if not the most hidden movements of prince charles but he could either paralyse a serious or promote a premature rising in the highlands as seemed best to his english employers we shall find pickle in company with that devoted jacobite lochgarry travelling through the highlands exciting hopes consulting the chiefs unburying a hidden treasure and encouraging the clans to rush once more on english bayonets romance in a way is stereotyped and it is characteristic that the last romance of the stuarts should be interwoven with a secret treasure this mass of french gold buried after culloden at loch arkaig in one of the most remote recesses of the highlands was to the jacobites what the dwarf andvari s hoard was to the niflungs a curse and a cause of discord we shall see that rivalry for its possession produced contending charges of disloyalty forgery and theft among certain of the highland chiefs and these may have helped to promote the spirit of treachery in pickle the spy it is probable though not certain that he had acted as the agent of cumberland before he was sold to henry pelham and he was certainly communicating the results of his inquiries in one sense to george ii and in another sense to the exiled james iii in rome he was betraying his own cousins and traducing his friends pickle is plainly no common spy or paltry vidette as he words it possibly sir walter scott knew who pickle was in him scott if he had chosen would have found a character very like barry lyndon but worse very unlike any personage in the waverley novels and somewhat akin to the master of ballantrae the cool good humoured smiling unscrupulous villain of high rank and noble lineage the scoundrel happily unconscious of his own unspeakable infamy proud and sensitive upon the point of honour the picturesque hypocrite in religion is a being whom we do not meet in sir walter s romances in pickle he had such a character ready made to his hand but in the time of scott it would have been dangerous as it is still disagreeable to unveil this old mystery of iniquity a friend of sir walter s a man very ready with the pistol the last as was commonly said of the highland chiefs was of the name and blood of pickle and would have taken up pickle s feud sir walter was not to be moved by pistols but not even for the sake of a good story would he hurt the sensibilities of a friend or tarnish the justly celebrated loyalty of the highlands now the friend of scott the representative of pickle in scott s generation was a highlander and pickle was not only a traitor a profligate an oppressor of his tenantry and a liar but according to jacobite gossip which reached king james a forger of the king s name moreover he was in all probability one fountain of that reproach true or false which still clings to the name of the brave and gentle archibald cameron the brother of lochiel whom pickle brought to the gallows if we add that when last we hear of pickle he is probably engaged in a double treason and certainly meditates selling a regiment of his clan like hessians to the hanoverian government it will be plain that his was no story for scott to tell pickle had at least the attraction of being eminently handsome no statelier gentleman than pickle as his faded portrait shows him in full highland costume ever trod a measure at holyrood tall athletic wit

are naturally inclined to scientific study than to linguistic or historical study so that if some science is to be learnt by everybody the amount of such study should be limited to acquiring in one or two sciences knowledge of the scientific method in general so much scientific training is indeed universally desirable because good training of the senses to observe accurately is universally desirable and the collecting comparing and grouping of many facts teach orderliness in thinking and lead up to something which spencer valued highly in education a rational explanation of phenomena science having obtained a foothold in secondary schools and colleges an adequate development of science teaching resulted from the introduction of options or elections for the pupils among numerous different courses in place of a curriculum prescribed for all the elaborate teaching of many sciences was thus introduced the pupil or student saw and recorded for himself used books only as helps and guides in seeing recording and generalising proceeded from the known to the unknown and in short made numerous applications of the doctrines which pervade all spencer s writings on education in the united states these methods were introduced earlier and have been carried farther than in england but within the last few years the changes made in education have been more extensive and rapid in england than in any other country witness the announcements of the new high schools and the re organised grammar schools of such colleges as south kensington armstrong king s the university college london and goldsmiths and of the new municipal universities such as victoria bristol sheffield birmingham liverpool and leeds the new technical schools also illustrate the advent of instruction in applied science as an important element in advanced education such institutions as the seafield park engineering college the city guilds of london institute the city of london college and the battersea polytechnic are instances of the same development some endowed institutions for girls illustrate the same tendencies as for example the bedford college for women and the royal holloway college all these institutions teach sciences in considerable variety and in the way that spencer advocated not so much because they have distinctly accepted his views as because modern industrial and social conditions compel the preparation in science of young people destined for various occupations and services indispensable to modern society the method of the preparation is essentially that which he advocated spencer s propositions to the effect that the study of science was desirable for artisans artists and in general for people who were to get their livings through various skills of hand and eye were received with great incredulity not to say derision particularly when he maintained that some knowledge of the theory which underlies an art was desirable for manual practitioners of the art but the changes of the last fifty years in the practice of the arts and trades may be said to have demonstrated that his views were thoroughly sound the applications of science in the arts and trades have been so numerous and productive that widespread training in science has become indispensable to any nation which means to excel in the manufacturing industries whether of large scale or small scale the extraordinary popularity of evening schools and correspondence schools in the united states rests on the need which young people employed in the various industries of the country feel of obtaining more theoretical knowledge about the physical or chemical processes through which they are earning a livelihood the young men s christian associations in the american cities have become great centres of evening instruction for just such young persons the correspondence schools are teaching hundreds of thousands of young people at work in machine shops mills mines and factories who believe that they can advance themselves in their several occupations by supplementing their elementary education with correspondence courses taken while they are at work earning a livelihood in industries that rest ultimately on applications of science spencer s objection to the constant exercise of authority and compulsion in schools families and the state is felt to day much more widely than it was in when he wrote his essay on moral education his proposal that children should be allowed to suffer the natural consequences of their foolish or wrong acts does not seem to the present generation any more than it did to him to be applicable to very young children who need protection from the undue severity of many natural penalties but the soundness of his general doctrine that it is the true function of parents and teachers to see that children habitually experience the normal consequences of their conduct without putting artificial consequences in place of them now commands the assent of most persons whose minds have been freed from the theological dogmas of original sin and total depravity spencer did not expect the immediate adoption of this principle because society as a whole was not yet humane enough he admitted that the uncontrollable child of ill controlled adults might sometimes have to be scolded or beaten and that these barbarous methods might be perhaps the best preparation such children can have for the barbarous society in which they are presently to play a part he hoped however that the civilised members of society would by and by spontaneously use milder measures and this hope has been realised in good degree with the result that happiness in childhood is much commoner and more constant than it used to be parents and teachers are beginning to realise that self control is a prime object in

his life threatened and so it was with us the men banded themselves together as if for war and made ready for the struggle which all knew must be near at hand unless his majesty should succeed in gaining better sense than he had shown since our people built up for him a nation in this new world we lads did not believe it possible we could do anything at such a time but looked forward to the day when having come to man s estate we might enlist as soldiers to drive out general gage and such as he from among us then the fortifications on the neck were strengthened the better to hold us prisoners all the gunpowder belonging to the province that had been stored at charlestown and cambridge was seized by the man who had made of himself our jailor and we were terrified by rumors that the king s ships were about to open fire on the town because our people were arming themselves the true men of new york connecticut vermont and from all the country roundabout boston rose up in their might marching at their best pace to our assistance and general gage must have understood that he was stirring up a hornet s nest for the rumors were denied and those who would have begun the war then

five hundred marines were landed from the asia man of war and thousands of lobster backs were voyaging from the jerseys new york and quebec was it any wonder that we of boston were the same as eaten out of our homes these men wearing red coats were not suffered to lack for the best of food but it mattered little what we colonists had and yet there were those among us born and bred in boston town who claimed that general gage was acting the part of an honest man at the beginning of the year no less than an hundred and fifty soldiers were on duty at the neck night and day and yet our people were able to send past them secretly such of weapons and ammunition as were to provide us at a later date with what might be needed to uphold our rights even the youngest among us understood that the day was not far distant when we must stand face to face with the lobster backs in battle array if we would preserve our own rights and every article which might be used in the coming struggle was smuggled under the noses of the guards our fathers sent out muskets in loads of manure cartridges in candle boxes pistols and swords in the baskets of such market women as were permitted to enter the town that they might bring provisions for the king s soldiers and the loyal men of boston had collected at cambridge quite a store of what would be needed when the time came that blood must be shed

did their recumbent drivers when they were awake which rarely happened so did the exhausted labourers in the fields everything that lived or grew was oppressed by the glare except the lizard passing

even the obtrusive stare blinked at it and left it to such refuse of reflected light as it could find for itself were two men besides the two men a notched and disfigured bench immovable from the wall with a draught board rudely hacked upon it with a knife a set of draughts made of old buttons and soup bones a set of dominoes two mats and two or three wine bottles that was all the chamber held exclusive of rats and other unseen vermin in addition to the seen vermin the two men it received such light as it got through a grating of iron bars fashioned like a pretty large window by means of which it could be always inspected from the gloomy staircase on which the grating gave there was a broad strong ledge of stone to this grating where the bottom of it was let into the masonry three or four feet above the ground upon it one of the two men lolled half sitting and half lying with his knees drawn up and his feet and shoulders planted against the opposite sides of the aperture the bars were wide enough apart to admit of his thrusting his arm through to the elbow and so he held on negligently for his greater ease a prison taint was on everything there the imprisoned air the imprisoned light the imprisoned damps the imprisoned men were all deteriorated by confinement as the captive men were faded and haggard so the iron was rusty the stone was slimy the wood was rotten the air was faint the light was dim like a well like a vault like a tomb the prison had no knowledge of the brightness outside and would have kept its polluted atmosphere intact in one of the spice islands of the indian ocean the man who lay on the ledge of the grating was even chilled he jerked his great cloak more heavily upon him by an impatient movement of one shoulder and growled to the devil with this brigand of a sun that never shines in here he was waiting to be fed looking sideways through the bars that he might see the further down the stairs with much of the expression of a wild beast in similar expectation but his eyes too close together were not so nobly set in his head as those of the king of beasts

out with several bottles and glasses half filled with wine which threw back the dull ray of an expiring lamp there had been mirth and revelry until the hand of the clock stood just at midnight when murder stepped between the boon companions a young man had fallen on the floor and lay stone dead with a ghastly wound crushed into his temple while over him with a delirium of mingled rage and horror in his countenance stood the youthful likeness of mr smith the murdered youth wore the features of edward spencer what does this rascal of a painter mean cries mr smith provoked beyond all patience edward spencer was my earliest and dearest friend true to me as i to him through more than half a century neither i nor any other ever murdered him was he not alive within five years and did he not in token of our long friendship bequeath me his gold headed cane and a mourning ring again had memory been turning over her volume and fixed at length upon so confused a page that she surely must have scribbled it when she was tipsy the purport was however that while mr smith and edward spencer were heating their young blood with wine a quarrel had flashed up between them and mr smith in deadly wrath had flung a bottle at spencer s head true it missed its aim and merely smashed a looking glass and the next morning when the incident was imperfectly remembered they had shaken hands with a hearty laugh yet again while memory was reading conscience unveiled her face struck a dagger to the heart of mr smith and quelled his remonstrance with her iron frown the pain was quite excruciating some of the pictures had been painted with so doubtful a touch and in colors so faint and pale that the subjects could barely be conjectured a dull semitransparent mist had been thrown over the surface of the canvas into which the figures seemed to vanish while the eye sought most earnestly to fix them but in every scene however dubiously portrayed mr smith was invariably haunted by his own lineaments at various ages as in a dusty mirror after poring several minutes over one of these blurred and almost indistinguishable pictures he began to see that the painter had intended to represent him now in the decline of life as stripping the clothes from the backs of three half starved children really this puzzles me quoth mr smith with the irony of conscious rectitude asking pardon of the painter i pronounce him a fool as well as a scandalous knave a man of my standing in the world to be robbing little children of their clothes ridiculous but while he spoke memory had searched her fatal volume and found a page which with her sad calm voice she poured into his ear it was not altogether inapplicable to the misty scene it told how mr smith had been grievously tempted by many devilish sophistries on the ground of a legal quibble to commence a lawsuit against three orphan children joint heirs to a considerable estate fortunately before he was quite decided his claims had turned out nearly as devoid of law as justice as memory ceased to read conscience again thrust aside her mantle and would have struck her victim with the envenomed dagger only that he struggled and clasped his hands before his heart even then however he sustained an ugly gash why should we follow fancy through the whole series of those awful pictures painted by an artist of wondrous power and terrible acquaintance with the secret soul they embodied the ghosts of all the never perpetrated sins that had glided through the lifetime of mr smith and could such beings of cloudy fantasy so near akin to nothingness give valid evidence against him at the day of judgment be that the case or not there is reason to believe that one truly penitential tear would have washed away each hateful picture and left the canvas white as snow but mr smith at a prick of conscience too keen to be endured bellowed aloud with impatient agony and suddenly discovered that his three guests were gone there he sat alone a silver haired and highly venerated old man in the rich gloom of the crimson curtained room with no box of pictures on the table but only a decanter of most excellent madeira yet his heart still seemed to fester with the venom of the dagger nevertheless the unfortunate old gentleman might have argued the matter with conscience and alleged many reasons wherefore she should not smite him so pitilessly were we to take up his cause it should be somewhat in the following fashion a scheme of guilt till it be put in execution greatly resembles a train of incidents in a projected tale the latter in order to produce a sense of reality in the reader s mind must be conceived with such proportionate strength by the author as to seem in the glow of fancy more like truth past present or to come than purely fiction the prospective sinner on the other hand weaves his plot of crime but seldom or never feels a perfect certainty that it will be executed there is a dreaminess diffused about his thoughts in a dream as it were he strikes the death blow into his victim s heart and starts to find an indelible blood stain on his hand thus a novel writer or a dramatist in creating a villain of romance and fitting him with evil deeds and the villain of actual life in projecting crimes that will be perpetrated may almost meet each other half way between reality and fancy it is not until the crime is accomplished that guilt clinches its gripe upon the guilty heart and claims it for its own then and not before sin is actually felt and acknowledged and if unaccompanied by repentance grows a thousand fold more virulent by its self consciousness be it considered also that men often overestimate their capacity for evil at a distance while its attendant circumstances do not press upon their notice and

is quite difficult to drop the pail in such a manner as to get any water when the vessel is under way i should like to try said marco you can find out whether the water is salt easier than that said forester you can let a twine string down and wet the end that will take up enough for a taste well said marco if i ve got a string long enough so saying he began to feel in his pockets for a string he found a piece of twine which he thought would be long enough but on trial it appeared that it would not reach quite to the water forester then tied it to the end of his cane and allowed marco to take the cane and hold it over the side of the vessel and by this means he succeeded in reaching the water and wetting the end of the string he could after all succeed in wetting only a small part of the string for it was drawn along so rapidly by the motion of the boat that it skipped upon the surface of the water without sinking in at length however after he had got the end a little wetted he drew it up and put it in his mouth how does it taste said forester the question was hardly necessary for the faces which marco made showed sufficiently plain that the water was bitter and salt yes it is salt said he then suddenly casting his eye upon a long dark looking substance which just then came floating by he called out why forester what is that a log said forester the log was round and straight and the ends were square the log glided rapidly by and soon disappeared it is a pine log said forester there are vast forests of pine trees in this state they cut down the trees and then cut the trunks into pieces of moderate length and draw them on the snow to the rivers then in the spring the waters rise and float the logs down this is one of these logs floating down sometimes the river is quite full of them where do they go asked marco oh men stop them all along the river and put them into booms and then fasten them together in rafts how do they fasten them together asked marco they drive a pin into the middle of each log and then extend a rope along fastening it to each pin in this manner the rope holds the logs together and they form a long raft when they catch the logs in booms they afterwards form them into rafts and so float them down the river to the mills where they are to be sawed can men stand upon the rafts said marco yes replied forester very well they make a floor of boards i suppose said marco no replied forester they stand directly upon the logs i should think the logs would sink under them replied marco or at least roll about they sink a little replied forester just about as much as the bulk of the man who stands upon them i don t know what you mean by that exactly said marco why the rule of floating bodies is this rejoined forester when any substance like a cake of ice or a log of wood or a boat is floating upon the water a part of it being above the water and a part under the water if a man steps upon it he makes it sink enough deeper to submerge a part of the wood or ice as large as he is himself if there is just as much of the wood or ice above the water as is equal to the bulk of the man then the man in stepping upon it will sink it just to the water s edge but perhaps one man would be heavier than another man said marco yes replied forester but then he would be larger and so according to the principle he would make more wood sink before the equilibrium was reached what is equilibrium asked marco equilibrium is an equality between two forces replied forester i don t see what two forces there are said marco there is the weight of the man pressing downwards said forester for one and the buoyant power of the water that is its upward pressure for the other the weight of the man remains constantly the same but the upward pressure of the water increases in proportion as the log sinks into it for the deeper the log sinks into the water the more of it is submerged and it is more acted upon and pressed upward by the water now as one of these forces remains constant and the other increases they must at length come to be equal that is in equilibrium and then the log will not sink any farther that s the philosophy of it marco marco did not reply but sat looking at the barren and rocky shores of the river as the boat glided by them presently another log came into view there said forester look at that log and see whether you think that you could float upon it yes said marco i think i could it depends said forester on the question whether the part of it which is out of water is as big as you are i think it is said marco yes added forester i have no doubt that it is only i should roll off said marco true replied forester but the millmen who work about the logs acquire astonishing dexterity in standing upon them if there is only enough of the log above water to equal their bulk so that it has buoyant power enough to float them they will keep it steady with their feet and sail about upon it very safely i should like to try said marco perhaps we shall have an opportunity at some place on the river said forester here marco suddenly interrupted the conversation by pointing up the river to a column of smoke and steam which he saw rising beyond a point of land which was just before them here comes another steamboat said he see forester no said forester i believe that is a steam mill a steam mill repeated marco yes replied forester they have steam mills and tide mills to saw up the logs in this part of the river farther up where there are waterfalls on the r

young frank gresham found himself member for east barsetshire although the very men who elected him knew that they had but slender ground for trusting him with their suffrages frank gresham though then only twenty four years of age was a married man and a father he had already chosen a wife and by his choice had given much ground of distrust to the men of east barsetshire he had married no other than lady arabella de courcy the sister of the great whig earl who lived at courcy castle in the west that earl who not only voted for the reform bill but had been infamously active in bringing over other young peers so to vote and whose name therefore stank in the nostrils of the staunch tory squires of the county not only had frank gresham so wedded but having thus improperly and unpatriotically chosen a wife he had added to his sins by becoming recklessly intimate with his wife s relations it is true that he still called himself a tory belonged to the club of which his father had been one of the most honoured members and in the days of the great battle got his head broken in a row on the right side but nevertheless it was felt by the good men true and blue of east barsetshire that a constant sojourner at courcy castle could not be regarded as a consistent tory when however his father died that broken head served him in good stead his sufferings in the cause were made the most of these in unison with his father s merits turned the scale and it was accordingly decided at a meeting held at the george and dragon at barchester that frank gresham should fill his father s shoes but frank gresham could not fill his father s shoes they were too big for him he did become member for east barsetshire but he was such a member so lukewarm so indifferent so prone to associate with the enemies of the good cause so little willing to fight the good fight that he soon disgusted those who most dearly loved the memory of the old squire de courcy castle in those days had great allurements for a young man and all those allurements were made the most of to win over young gresham his wife who was a year or two older than himself was a fashionable woman with thorough whig tastes and aspirations such as became the daughter of a great whig earl she cared for politics or thought that she cared for them more than her husband did for a month or two previous to her engagement she had been attached to the court and had been made to believe that much of the policy of england s rulers depended on the political intrigues of england s women she was one who would fain be doing something if she only knew how and the first important attempt she made was to turn her respectable young tory husband into a second rate whig bantling as this lady s character will it is hoped show itself in the following pages we need not now describe it more closely it is not a bad thing to be son in law to a potent earl member of parliament for a county and a possessor of a fine old english seat and a fine old english fortune as a very young man frank gresham found the life to which he was thus introduced agreeable enough he consoled himself as best he might for the blue looks with which he was greeted by his own party and took his revenge by consorting more thoroughly than ever with his political adversaries foolishly like a foolish moth he flew to the bright light and like the moths of course he burnt his wings early in he had become a member of parliament and in the autumn of the dissolution came young members of three or four and twenty do not think much of dissolutions forget the fancies of their constituents and are too proud of the present to calculate much as to the future so it was with mr gresham his father had been member for barsetshire all his life and he looked forward to similar prosperity as though it were part of his inheritance but he failed to take any of the steps which had secured his father s seat in the autumn of the dissolution came and frank gresham with his honourable lady wife and all the de courcys at his back found that he had mortally offended the county to his great disgust another candidate was brought forward as a fellow to his late colleague and though he manfully fought the battle and spent ten thousand pounds in the contest he could not recover his position a high tory with a great whig interest to back him is never a popular person in england no one can trust him though there may be those who are willing to place him untrusted in high positions such was the case with mr gresham there were many who were willing for family considerations to keep him in parliament but no one thought that he was fit to be there the consequences were that a bitter and expensive contest ensued frank gresham when twitted with being a whig foreswore the de courcy family and then when ridiculed as having been thrown over by the tories foreswore his father s old friends so between the two stools he fell to the ground and as a politician he never again rose to his feet he never again rose to his feet but twice again he made violent efforts to do so elections in east barsetshire from various causes came quick upon each other in those days and before he was eight and twenty years of age mr gresham had three times contested the county and been three times beaten to speak the truth of him his own spirit would have been satisfied with the loss of the first ten thousand pounds but lady arabella was made of higher mettle she had married a man with a fine place and a fine fortune but she had nevertheless married a commoner and had in so far derogated from her high birth she felt that her husband should be by rights a member of the house of lords but if not that it was at least e

a time for which nothing is too surprising a time in which we all ought to be prepared from the least to the greatest to see the greatest horrors and the greatest blessings come suddenly upon us like a thief in the night so much for christ s coming being too wonderful a thing to happen just now still you are right to ask what do you mean by christ s being our king what do you mean by his coming to us what reason have you for supposing that he is coming now rather than at any other time and if he be coming what are we to do what is there we ought to repent of what is there we ought to amend well my friends it is just these very questions which i hope and trust god will help me to answer to you in my next few sermons i am perfectly convinced that we must get them answered and act upon them speedily i am perfectly convinced that if we go on as most of us are going in england now the lord of us all will come in an hour when we are not aware and cut us asunder in the deepest and most real sense as he came and cut asunder france germany and austria only last year and appoint us our portion with the unbelievers and i believe that our punishment will be seven times as severe as that of either france germany or austria because we have had seven times their privileges and blessings seven times their gospel light and christian knowledge seven times their freedom and justice in laws and constitution seven times their wealth and prosperity and means of employing our population much has been given to england and of her much will be required and if you could only see the state of mankind over the greatest part of the globe how infinitely fewer opportunities they have of knowing god s will than you have you would feel that to you poor and struggling as some of you are to you much has been given and of you much will be required now first what do i mean by christ being our king i daresay there are some among you who are inclined to think that when we talk of christ being a king that the word king means something very different from its common meaning and god knows that that is true enough our blessed lord took care to make people understand that how he was not like one of the kings of the nations how his kingdom was not of this world but yet the bible tells us again and again that all good kings all real kings are patterns of christ and therefore that when we talk of christ being a king we mean that he is a king in everything that a king ought to be that he fulfils perfectly all the duties of a king that he is the pattern which all kings ought to copy kings have been in all ages too apt to forget that and indeed so have the people too we english have forgotten most thoroughly in these days that christ is our king or even a king at all we talk of christ being a spiritual king and then we say that that merely means that he is king of christians hearts and when anyone asks what that means it comes out that all we mean is that christ has a very great influence over the hearts of believing christians when he can obtain it or else that it means that he is king of a very small number of people called the elect whom he has chosen out but that he has absolutely nothing to do with the whole rest of the world and then when anyone stands up with the bible in his hand and says in the plain words of scripture christ is not only the king of believers he is the king of the whole earth the king of the clouds and the thunder the king of the land and the cattle and the trees and the corn and to whomsoever he will he giveth them christ is not only the king of believers he is the king of all the king of the wicked of the heathen of those who do not believe him who never heard of him christ is not only the king of a few individual persons one here and one there in every parish but he is the king of every nation he is the king of england by the grace of god just as much as queen victoria is and ten thousand times more if any man talks in this way people stare think him an enthusiast ask him what new doctrine this is and call his words unscriptural just because they come out of scripture and not out of men s perversions and twistings of scripture nevertheless christ is king really and truly king of kings and lord of lords and he will make men know it what he was that he is and ever will be there is no change in him his kingdom is an everlasting kingdom and his dominion endureth throughout all ages and woe unto those small or great who rebel against him but what sort of a king is he he is a king of law and order and justice he is not selfish fanciful self willed he said himself that he came not to do his own will but his father s he is a king of gentleness and meekness too but do not mistake that there is no weak indulgence in him a man may be very meek and yet stern enough and strong enough moses was the meekest of men we read and yet he made those who rebelled against him feel that he was not to be trifled with korah dathan and abiram found that to their cost he would not even spare his own brother aaron his own sister miriam when they rebelled and he was right he showed his love by it indulgence is not love it is no sign of meekness but only of cowardice and carelessness to be afraid to rebuke sin moses knew that he was doing god s work that he was appointed to make a great nation of those slavish besotted jews his countrymen that he was sent by god with boundless blessings to them and woe to whoever hindered him from that because he loved the jews therefore he dared punish those who tempted them to forget the promised land of canaan or break god s covenant in which lay all their hope and such a one is our king my friends jesus christ the son

noisy at such times too his face flamed with augmented blazonry as if cannel coal had been heaped on anthracite he made an unpleasant racket with his chair spilled his sand box in mending his pens impatiently split them all to pieces and threw them on the floor in a sudden passion stood up and leaned over his table boxing his papers about in a most indecorous manner very sad to behold in an elderly man like him nevertheless as he was in many ways a most valuable person to me and all the time before twelve o clock meridian was the quickest steadiest creature too accomplishing a great deal of work in a style not easy to be matched for these reasons i was willing to overlook his eccentricities though indeed occasionally i remonstrated with him i did this very gently however because though the civilest nay the blandest and most reverential of men in the morning yet in the afternoon he was disposed upon provocation to be slightly rash with his tongue in fact insolent now valuing his morning services as i did and resolved not to lose them yet at the same time made uncomfortable by his inflamed ways after twelve o clock and being a man of peace unwilling by my admonitions to call forth unseemly retorts from him i took upon me one saturday noon he was always worse on saturdays to hint to him very kindly that perhaps now that he was growing old it might be well to abridge his labors in short he need not come to my chambers after twelve o clock but dinner over had best go home to his lodgings and rest himself till teatime but no he insisted upon his afternoon devotions his countenance became intolerably fervid as he oratorically assured me gesticulating with a long ruler at the other end of the room that if his services in the morning were useful how indispensable then in the afternoon with submission sir said turkey on this occasion i consider myself your right hand man in the morning i but marshal and deploy my columns but in the afternoon i put myself at their head and gallantly charge the foe thus and he made a violent thrust with the ruler but the blots turkey intimated i true but with submission sir behold these hairs i am getting old surely sir a blot or two of a warm afternoon is not to be severely urged against gray hairs old age even if it blot the page is honorable with submission sir we both are getting old this appeal to my fellow feeling was hardly to be resisted at all events i saw that go he would not so i made up my mind to let him stay resolving nevertheless to see to it that during the afternoon he had to do with my less important papers nippers the second on my list was a whiskered sallow and upon the whole rather piratical looking young man of about five and twenty i always deemed him the victim of two evil powers ambition and indigestion the ambition was evinced by a certain impatience of the duties of a mere copyist an unwarrantable usurpation of strictly professional affairs such as the original drawing up of legal documents the indigestion seemed betokened in an occasional nervous testiness and grinning irritability causing the teeth to audibly grind together over mistakes committed in copying unnecessary maledictions hissed rather than spoken in the heat of business and especially by a continual discontent with the height of the table where he worked though of a very ingenious mechanical turn nippers could never get this table to suit him he put chips under it blocks of various sorts bits of pasteboard and at last went so far as to attempt an exquisite adjustment by final pieces of folded blotting paper but no invention would answer if for the sake of easing his back he brought the table lid at a sharp angle well up towards his chin and wrote there like a man using the steep roof of a dutch house for his desk then he declared that it stopped the circulation in his arms if now he lowered the table to his waistbands and stooped over it in writing then there was a sore aching in his back in short the truth of the matter was nippers knew not what he wanted or if he wanted any thing it was to be rid of a scrivener s table altogether among the manifestations of his diseased ambition was a fondness he had for receiving visits from certain ambiguous looking fellows in seedy coats whom he called his clients indeed i was aware that not only was he at times considerable of a ward politician but he occasionally did a little business at the justices courts and was not unknown on the steps of the tombs i have good reason to believe however that one individual who called upon him at my chambers and who with a grand air he insisted was his client was no other than a dun and the alleged title deed a bill but with all his failings and the annoyances he caused me nippers like his compatriot turkey was a very useful man to me wrote a neat swift hand and when he chose was not deficient in a gentlemanly sort of deportment added to this he always dressed in a gentlemanly sort of way and so incidentally reflected credit upon my chambers whereas with respect to turkey i had much ado to keep him from being a reproach to me his clothes were apt to look oily and smell of eating houses he wore his pantaloons very loose and baggy in summer his coats were execrable his hat not to be handled but while the hat was a thing of indifference to me inasmuch as his natural civility and deference as a dependent englishman always led him to doff it the moment he entered the room yet his coat was another matter concerning his coats i reasoned with him but with no effect the truth was i suppose that a man of so small an income could not afford to sport such a lustrous face and a

her flower pot it was about six inches high the sight of this orange tree interested marco very much for it reminded him of home he had often seen orange trees growing in the parlors and green houses in new york what a pretty little orange tree said marco where did you get it how did you know it was an orange tree said the girl o i know an orange tree well enough replied marco i have seen them many a time where asked the girl in new york said marco did your orange tree come from new york no said the girl i planted an orange seed and it grew from that i ve got a lemon tree too she added but it is a great deal larger the lemon tree grows faster than the orange my lemon tree is so large that i couldn t bring it home very well so i left it in the mill in the mill said marco are you a miller the girl laughed she was a very good humored girl and did not appear to be displeased though it certainly was not quite proper for marco to speak in that manner to a stranger she did not however reply to his question but said after a pause do you know where the montpelier stage is the proper english meaning of the word stage is a portion of the road traveled between one resting place and another but in the united states it is used to mean the carriage being a sort of contraction for stage coach no said marco we are going in that stage i wish it would come along said the girl for i m tired of watching my trunk where is your trunk said marco so the girl pointed out her trunk it was upon the platform of the piazza near those belonging to forester and marco the girl showed marco her name which was mary williams written on a card upon the end of it i ll watch your trunk said marco and you can go in and sit down until the stage comes mary thanked him and went in she was not however quite sure that her baggage was safe intrusted thus to the charge of a strange boy and so she took a seat near the window where she could keep an eye upon it there was a blue chest near these trunks which looked like a sailor s chest and marco being tired of standing sat down upon this chest he had however scarcely taken his seat when he saw a coach with four horses coming round a corner it was driven by a small boy not larger than marco it wheeled up toward the door and came to a stand some men then put on the sailor s chest and the trunks mary williams came out and got into the coach she sat on the back seat forester and marco got in and took their places on the middle seat a young man dressed like a sailor took the front seat at one corner of the coach these were all the passengers that were to get in here when every thing was ready they drove away the stage stopped however in a few minutes at the door of a handsome house in the town and took a gentleman and lady in these new passengers took places on the back seat with mary williams this company rode in perfect silence for some time forester took out a book and began to read the gentleman on the back seat went to sleep mary williams and marco looked out at the windows watching the changing scenery the sailor rode in silence moving his lips now and then as if he were talking to himself but taking no notice of any of the company the coach stopped at the villages which they passed through to exchange the mail and sometimes to take in new passengers in the course of these changes marco got his place shifted to the forward seat by the side of the sailor and he gradually got into conversation with him marco introduced the conversation by asking the sailor if he knew how far it was to montpelier no said the sailor i don t keep any reckoning but i wish we were there why asked marco o i expect the old cart will capsize somewhere among these mountains and break our necks for us marco had observed all the morning that when the coach canted to one side or the other on account of the unevenness of the road the sailor always started and looked anxious as if afraid it was going to be upset he wondered that a man who had been apparently accustomed to the terrible dangers of the seas should be alarmed at the gentle oscillations of a stage coach are you afraid that we shall upset asked marco yes said the sailor over some of these precipices and mountains and then there ll be an end of us the sailor said this in an easy and careless manner as if after all he was not much concerned about the danger still marco was surprised that he should fear it at all he was not aware how much the fears which people feel are occasioned by the mere novelty of the danger which they incur a stage driver who is calm and composed on his box in a dark night and upon dangerous roads will be alarmed by the careening of a ship under a gentle breeze at sea while the sailor who laughs at a gale of wind on the ocean is afraid to ride in a carriage on land an t you a sailor asked marco yes replied his companion i shouldn t think that a man that had been used to the sea would be afraid of upsetting in a coach i m not a man said the sailor what are you said marco i m a boy i m only nineteen years old though i m going to be rated seaman next voyage have you just got back from a voyage asked marco yes said the sailor i ve been round the horn in a whaler from old nantuck and now i m going home to see my mother how long since you ve seen her asked marco o it s four years since i ran away here the sailor began to speak in rather a lower tone than he had done before so that marco only could hear this was not difficult as the other passengers were at this time engaged in conversation i ran away continued the

lines express you merit more nor could my love do less epistle to mr congreve i was then and have been ever since most sensibly touched with that expression and the more so because i could not find in myself the means of satisfying the passion which i felt in me to do something answerable to an injunction laid upon me in so pathetic and so amicable a manner you my lord have furnished me with ample means of acquitting myself both of my duty and obligation to my departed friend what kinder office lies in me to do to these his most valuable and imperishable remains than to commit them to the protection and lodge them under the roof of a patron whose hospitality has extended itself even to his dust if i would permit myself to run on in the way which so fairly opens itself before me i should tire your grace with reiterated praises and acknowledgments and i might possibly notwithstanding my pretended right so to do give some handle to such who are inclinable to censure to tax me of affectation and officiousness in thanking you more than comes to my share for doing a thing which is in truth of a public consideration as it is doing an honour to your country for so unquestionably it is to do honour to him who was an honour to it i have but one thing to say either to obviate or to answer such an objection if it shall be made to me which is that i loved mr dryden i have not touched upon any other public honour or bounty done by you to your country i have industriously declined entering upon a theme of so extensive a nature and of all your numerous and continual largesses to the public i have only singled out this as what most particularly affected me i confess freely to your grace i very much admire all those other donations but i much more love this and i cannot help it if i am naturally more delighted with any thing that is amiable than with any thing that is wonderful whoever shall censure me i dare be confident you my lord will excuse me for any thing that i shall say with due regard to a gentleman for whose person i had as just an affection as i have an admiration of his writings and indeed mr dryden had personal qualities to challenge both love and esteem from all who were truly acquainted with him he was of a nature exceedingly humane and compassionate easily forgiving injuries and capable of a prompt and sincere reconciliation with them who had offended him such a temperament is the only solid foundation of all moral virtues and sociable endowments his friendship where he professed it went much beyond his professions and i have been told of strong and generous instances of it by the persons themselves who received them though his hereditary income was little more than a bare competency as his reading had been very extensive so was he very happy in a memory tenacious of every thing that he had read he was not more possessed of knowledge than he was communicative of it but then his communication of it was by no means pedantic or imposed upon the conversation but just such and went so far as by the natural turns of the discourse in which he was engaged it was necessarily promoted or required he was extreme ready and gentle in his correction of the errors of any writer who thought fit to consult him and full as ready and patient to admit of the reprehension of others in respect of his own oversight or mistakes he was of very easy i may say of very pleasing access but something slow and as it were diffident in his advances to others he had something in his nature that abhorred intrusion into any society whatsoever indeed it is to be regretted that he was rather blameable in the other extreme for by that means he was personally less known and consequently his character might become liable both to misapprehensions and misrepresentations to the best of my knowledge and observation he was of all the men that ever i knew one of the most modest and the most easily to be discountenanced in his approaches either to his superiors or his equals i have given your grace this slight sketch of his personal character as well to vindicate his memory as to justify myself for the love which i bore to his person and i have the rather done it because i hope it may be acceptable to you to know that he was worthy of the distinction you have shewn him as a man as well as an author as to his writings i shall not take upon me to speak of them for to say little of them would not be to do them right and to say all that i ought to say would be to be very voluminous but i may venture to say in general terms that no man hath written in our language so much and so various matter and in so various manners so well another thing i may say very peculiar to him which is that his parts did not decline with his years but that he was an improving writer to his last even to near seventy years of age improving even in fire and imagination as well as in judgment witness his ode on st cecilia s day and his fables his latest performances he was equally excellent in verse and in prose his prose had all the clearness imaginable together with all the nobleness of expression all the graces and ornaments

pursuant to the awards of the commissioners under the act of the d of march if however it should not be deemed advisable to carry that recommendation into effect i would suggest that authority be given for investing the principal over the proceeds of the surplus referred to in good securities with a view to the satisfaction of such other just claims of our citizens against china as are not unlikely to arise hereafter in the course of our extensive trade with that empire by the act of the th of august last congress authorized the president to instruct the commanders of suitable vessels to defend themselves against and to capture pirates this authority has been exercised in a single instance only for the more effectual protection of our extensive and valuable commerce in the eastern

strength of the army and for recommendations having in view an increase of its efficiency and the well being of the various branches of the service intrusted to his care it is gratifying to know that the patriotism of the people has proved equal to the occasion and that the number of troops tendered greatly exceeds the force which congress authorized me to call into the field i refer with pleasure to those portions of his report which make allusion to the creditable degree of discipline already attained by our troops and to the excellent sanitary condition of the entire army the recommendation of the secretary for an organization of the militia upon a uniform basis is a subject of vital importance to the future safety of the country and is commended to the serious attention of congress the large addition to the regular army in connection with the defection that has so considerably diminished the number of its officers gives peculiar importance to his recommendation for increasing the

subject of distaste at best more likely revulsion to the vast majority of the reading public perhaps the nature of the novel itself led him to consider publishing it anonymously although we know he was not averse to controversial subjects in his first book the macdermots of ballycloran which he thought had the best plot of all his novels the principal female character is seduced by a scoundrel and dies giving birth to an illegitimate child certainly nina was well suited for the experiment because of it s different setting and subject matter perhaps further to disguise his authorship trollope wrote nina in a style of prose that reads almost like a translation from a foreign language the experiment did not last long enough to test trollope s hypothesis mr hutton critic for the spectator recognized trollope as the author and so stated in his review trollope did not deny the accusation one cannot discuss nina balatka without addressing the question was trollope himself anti semitic a careful reading of his works does not provide a clear answer jews appear in some of his books and are referred to in others often as disreputable characters or money lenders they are seldom mentioned by his christian characters with respect probably realistically reflecting the sentiments of the classes he wrote about some of his greatest villains in his later novels melmotte in the way we live now and lopez in the prime minister are rumored to be jewish but trollope never unequivocally identifies them as jewish perhaps his christian characters expect them to be jewish because they are foreigners and villains however if one ignores the dialogue of his characters even the descriptive and editorial comments by trollope himself at first seem anti semitic he consistently uses jew as a pejorative adjective instead of jewish his descriptions of the appearance of jewish characters are usually unflattering and stereotypical even anton trendellsohn the hero of nina balatka is described as follows to those who know the outward types of his race there could be no doubt that anton trendellsohn was a very jew among jews he was certainly a handsome man not now very young having reached some year certainly in advance of thirty and his face was full of intellect he was slightly made below the middle height but was well made in every limb with small feet and hands and small ears and a well turned neck he was very dark dark as a man can be and yet show no sign of colour in his blood no white man could be more dark and swarthy than anton trendellsohn his eyes however which were quite black were very bright his jet black hair as it clustered round his ears had in it something of a curl had it been allowed to grow it would almost have hung in ringlets but it was worn very short as though its owner were jealous even of the curl anton trendellsohn was decidedly a handsome man but his eyes were somewhat too close together in his face and the bridge of his aquiline nose was not sharply cut as is mostly the case with such a nose on a christian face the olive oval face was without doubt the face of a jew and the mouth was greedy and the teeth were perfect and bright and the movement of the man s body was the movement of a jew this is not the typical description of the romantic hero of a victorian novel even so trollope s description of anton is less derogatory than his description of ezekiel brehgert a character in a later novel the way we live now he was a fat greasy man good looking in a certain degree about fifty with hair dyed black and beard and moustache dyed a dark purple colour the charm of his face consisted in a pair of very bright black eyes which were however set too near together in his face for the general delight of christians he was stout fat all over rather than corpulent and had that look of command in his face which has become common to master butchers probably by long intercourse with sheep and oxen the case for trollope being anti semitic is harder to support however when one considers the behavior of his jewish characters brehgert whose physical description above is stereotypic is one of the few characters in the way we live now whose actions are completely honorable trollope wrote novels before nina balatka only two of those contain jewish characters the first who plays a minor role in orley farm is soloman aram an attorney a victorian rumpole known for defending the accused at the old bailey his skill is needed to defend lady mason against a charge of perjury much to the distaste of her christian advisors he acts with dignity and shows great consideration for the personal comfort of lady mason during her trial the second jewish character in trollope s novels was mr hart a london tailor who runs for a seat in parliament in rachel ray this served no purpose in the plot the situation probably was included because legislation to allow jews to serve in parliament had been passed only five years before and the issue was still one of public discussion mr hart s appearance is brief he speaks only one or two lines and the reader is not told enough about him to judge his character trollope describes him thus and then the jewish hero the tailor himself came among them and astonished their minds by the ease and volubility of his speeches he did not pronounce his words with any of those soft slushy judaic utterances by which they had been taught to believe he would disgrace himself his nose was not hookey with any especial hook nor was it thicker at the

to a specie basis and no substitute for it can be devised it should be commenced now and reached at the earliest practicable moment consistent with a fair regard to the interests of the debtor class immediate resumption if practicable would not be desirable it would compel the debtor class to pay beyond their contracts the premium on gold at the date of their purchase and would bring bankruptcy and ruin to thousands fluctuation however in the paper value of the measure of all values gold is detrimental to the interests of trade it makes the man of business an involuntary gambler for in all sales where future payment is to be made both parties speculate as to what will be the value of the currency to be paid and received i earnestly recommend to you then such legislation as will insure a gradual return to specie payments and put an immediate stop to fluctuations in the value of currency the methods to secure the former of these results are as numerous as are the speculators on political economy to secure the latter i see but one way and that is to authorize the treasury to redeem its own paper at a fixed price whenever presented and to withhold from circulation all currency so redeemed until sold again for gold the vast resources of the nation both developed and undeveloped ought to make our credit the best on earth with a less burden of taxation than the citizen has endured for six years past the entire public debt could be paid in ten years but it is not desirable that the people should be taxed to pay it in that time year by year the ability to pay increases in a rapid ratio but the burden of interest ought to be reduced as rapidly as can be done without the violation of contract the public debt is represented in great part by bonds having from five to twenty and from ten to forty years to run bearing interest at the rate of per cent and per cent respectively it is optional with the government to pay these bonds at any period after the expiration of the least time mentioned upon their face the time has already expired when a great part of them may be taken up and is rapidly approaching when all may be it is believed that all which are now due may be replaced by bonds bearing a rate of interest not exceeding per cent and as rapidly as the remainder become due that they may be replaced in the same way to accomplish this it may be necessary to authorize the interest to be paid at either of three or four of the money centers of europe or by any assistant treasurer of the united states at the option of the holder of the bond i suggest this subject for the consideration of congress and also simultaneously with this the propriety of redeeming our currency as before suggested at its market value at the time the law goes into effect increasing the rate at which currency shall be bought and sold from day to day or week to week at the same rate of interest as government pays upon its bonds the subjects of tariff and internal taxation will necessarily receive your attention the revenues of the country are greater than the requirements and may with safety be reduced but as the funding of the debt in a or a per cent loan would reduce annual current expenses largely thus after funding justifying a greater reduction of taxation than would be now expedient i suggest postponement of this question until the next meeting of congress it may be advisable to modify taxation and tariff in instances where unjust or burdensome discriminations are made by the present laws but a general revision of the laws regulating this subject i recommend the postponement of for the present i also suggest the renewal of the tax on incomes but at a reduced rate say of per cent and this tax to expire in three years with the funding of the national debt as here suggested i feel safe in saying that taxes and the revenue from imports may be reduced safely from sixty to eighty millions per annum at once and may be still further reduced from year to year as the resources of the country are developed the report of the secretary of the treasury shows the receipts of the government for the fiscal year ending june to be and the expenditures including interest bounties etc to be the estimates for the ensuing year are more favorable to the government and will no doubt show a much larger decrease of the public debt the receipts in the treasury beyond expenditures have exceeded the amount necessary to place to the credit of the sinking fund as provided by law to lock up the surplus in the treasury and withhold it from circulation would lead to such a contraction of the currency as to cripple trade and seriously affect the prosperity of the country under these circumstances the secretary of the treasury and myself heartily concurred in the propriety of using all the surplus currency in the treasury in the purchase of government bonds thus reducing the interest bearing indebtedness of the country and of submitting to congress the question of the disposition to be made of the bonds so purchased the bonds now held by the treasury amount to about seventy five millions including those belonging to the sinking fund i recommend that the whole be placed to the credit of the sinking fund your attention is respectfully invited to the recommendations of the secretary of the treasury for the creation of the office of commissioner of customs revenue for the increase of salaries to certain classes of officials the substitution of increased national bank circulation to replace the outstanding per cent certificates and most especially to his recommendation for the repeal of laws allowing shares of fines penalties forfeitures etc to officers of the government or to informers the office of

point of view paid highly desirable tithes but it was nestled in a snug well wooded hollow quite an hour s journey on horseback from any turnpike where it was never reached by the vibrations of the coach horn or of public opinion it was an important looking village with a fine old church and large churchyard in the heart of it and two or three large brick and stone homesteads with well walled orchards and ornamental weathercocks standing close upon the road and lifting more imposing fronts than the rectory which peeped from among the trees on the other side of the churchyard a village which showed at once the summits of its social life and told the practised eye that there was no great park and manor house in the vicinity but that there were several chiefs in raveloe who could farm badly quite at their ease drawing enough money from their bad farming in those war times to live in a rollicking fashion and keep a jolly christmas whitsun and easter tide it was fifteen years since silas marner had first come to raveloe he was then simply a pallid young man with prominent short sighted brown eyes whose appearance would have had nothing strange for people of average culture and experience but for the villagers near whom he had come to settle it had mysterious peculiarities which corresponded with the exceptional nature of his occupation and his advent from an unknown region called north ard so had his way of life he invited no comer to step across his door sill and he never strolled into the village to drink a pint at the rainbow or to gossip at the wheelwright s he sought no man or woman save for the purposes of his calling or in order to supply himself with necessaries and it was soon clear to the raveloe lasses that he would never urge one of them to accept him against her will quite as if he had heard them declare that they would never marry a dead man come to life again this view of marner s personality was not without another ground than his pale face and unexampled eyes for jem rodney the mole catcher averred that one evening as he was returning homeward he saw silas marner leaning against a stile with a heavy bag on his back instead of resting the bag on the stile as a man in his senses would have done and that on coming up to him he saw that marner s eyes were set like a dead man s and he spoke to him and shook him and his limbs were stiff and his hands clutched the bag as if they d been made of iron but just as he had made up his mind that the weaver was dead he came all right again like as you might say in the winking of an eye and said good night and walked off all this jem swore he had seen more by token that it was the very day he had been mole catching on squire cass s land down by the old saw pit some said marner must have been in a fit a word which seemed to explain things otherwise incredible but the argumentative mr macey clerk of the parish shook his head and asked if anybody was ever known to go off in a fit and not fall down a fit was a stroke wasn t it and it was in the nature of a stroke to partly take away the use of a man s limbs and throw him on the parish if he d got no children to look to no no it was no stroke that would let a man stand on his legs like a horse between the shafts and then walk off as soon as you can say gee but there might be such a thing as a man s soul being loose from his body and going out and in like a bird out of its nest and back and that was how folks got over wise for they went to school in this shell less state to those who could teach them more than their neighbours could learn with their five senses and the parson and where did master marner get his knowledge of herbs from and charms too if he liked to give them away jem rodney s story was no more than what might have been expected by anybody who had seen how marner had cured sally oates and made her sleep like a baby when her heart had been beating enough to burst her body for two months and more while she had been under the doctor s care he might cure more folks if he would but he was worth speaking fair if it was only to keep him from doing you a mischief it was partly to this vague fear that marner was indebted for protecting him from the persecution that his singularities might have drawn upon him but still more to the fact that the old linen weaver in the neighbouring parish of tarley being dead his handicraft made him a highly welcome settler to the richer housewives of the district and even to the more provident cottagers who had their little stock of yarn at the year s end their sense of his usefulness would have counteracted any repugnance or suspicion which was not confirmed by a deficiency in the quality or the tale of the cloth he wove for them and the years had rolled on without producing any change in the impressions of the neighbours concerning marner except the change from novelty to habit at the end of fifteen years the raveloe men said just the same things about silas marner as at the beginning they did not say them quite so often but they believed them much more strongly when they did say them there was only one important addition which the years had brought it was that master marner had laid by a fine sight of money somewhere and that he could buy up bigger men than himself but while opinion concerning him had remained nearly stationary and his daily habits had presented scarcely any visible change marner s inward life had been a history and a metamorphosis as that of every fervid nature must be when it has fled or been condemned to solitude his

rise to the practice then the coverdales were cousins of the garrows and they had usually been there as children at the christmas last past the custom had been broken for young holmes had been abroad previous to that they had all been children excepting him but now that they were to meet again they were no longer children elizabeth at any rate was not so for she had already counted nineteen winters and isabella holmes was coming now isabella was two years older than elizabeth and had been educated in brussels moreover she was comparatively a stranger at thwaite hall never having been at those early christmas meetings and now i must take permission to begin my story by telling a lady s secret elizabeth garrow had already been in love with godfrey holmes or perhaps it might be more becoming to say that godfrey holmes had already been in love with her they had already been engaged and alas they had already agreed that that engagement should be broken off young holmes was now twenty seven years of age and was employed in a bank at liverpool not as a clerk but as assistant manager with a large salary he was a man well to do in the world who had money also of his own and who might well afford to marry some two years since on the eve of leaving thwaite hall he had with low doubting whisper told elizabeth that he loved her and she had flown trembling to her mother godfrey my boy the father said to him as he parted with him the next morning bessy is only a child and too young to think of this yet at the next christmas godfrey was in italy and the thing was gone by so at least the father and mother said to each other but the young people had met in the summer and one joyful letter had come from the girl home to her mother i have accepted him dearest dearest mamma i do love him but don t tell papa yet for i have not quite accepted him i think i am sure but i am not quite sure i am not quite sure about him and then two days after that there had come a letter that was not at all joyful dearest mamma it is not to be it is not written in the book we have both agreed that it will not do i am so glad that you have not told dear papa for i could never make him understand you will understand for i shall tell you everything down to his very words but we have agreed that there shall be no quarrel it shall be exactly as it was and he will come at christmas all the same it would never do that he and papa should be separated nor could we now put off isabella it is better so in every way for there is and need be no quarrel we still like each other i am sure i like him but i know that i should not make him happy as his wife he says it is my fault i at any rate have never told him that i thought it his from all which it will be seen that the confidence between the mother and daughter was very close elizabeth garrow was a very good girl but it might almost be a question whether she was not too good she had learned or thought that she had learned that most girls are vapid silly and useless given chiefly to pleasure seeking and a hankering after lovers and she had resolved that she would not be such a one industry self denial and a religious purpose in life were the tasks which she set herself and she went about the performance of them with much courage but such tasks though they are excellently well adapted to fit a young lady for the work of living may also be carried too far and thus have the effect of unfitting her for that work when elizabeth garrow made up her mind that the finding of a husband was not the only purpose of life she did very well it is very well that a young lady should feel herself capable of going through the world happily without one but in teaching herself this she also taught herself to think that there was a certain merit in refusing herself the natural delight of a lover even though the possession of the lover were compatible with all her duties to herself her father and mother and the world at large it was not that she had determined to have no lover she made no such resolve and when the proper lover came he was admitted to her heart but she declared to herself unconsciously that she must put a guard upon herself lest she should be betrayed into weakness by her own happiness she had resolved that in loving her lord she would not worship him and that in giving her heart she would only so give it as it should be given to a human creature like herself she had acted on these high resolves and hence it had come to pass not unnaturally that mr godfrey holmes had told her that it was her fault she was a pretty fair girl with soft dark brown hair and soft long dark eyelashes her grey eyes though quiet in their tone were tender and lustrous her face was oval and the lines of her cheek and chin perfect in their symmetry she was generally quiet in her demeanour but when moved she could rouse herself to great energy and speak with feeling and almost with fire her fault was a reverence for martyrdom in general and a feeling of which she was unconscious that it became a young woman to be unhappy in secret that it became a young woman i might rather say to have a source of unhappiness hidden from the world in general and endured without any detriment to her outward cheerfulness we know the story of the spartan boy who held the fox under his tunic the fox was biting into him into the very entrails but the young hero spake never a word now bessy garrow was inclined to think that it was a good thing to have a fox always biting so that the torment caused no ruffling to her outward smiles now at this moment the fox within her bosom was biting her sore enough but she bore it without flinching if you would rath

sat down by the bedside to calculate his chances the ministry were to be out within five days his father was to be dead within no he rejected that view of the subject the ministry were to be out and the diocese might probably be vacant at the same period there was much doubt as to the names of the men who were to succeed to power and a week must elapse before a cabinet was formed would not vacancies be filled by the outgoing men during this week dr grantly had a kind of idea that such would be the case but did not know and then he wondered at his own ignorance on such a question he tried to keep his mind away from the subject but he could not the race was so very close and the stakes were so very high he then looked at the dying man s impassive placid face there was no sign there of death or disease it was something thinner than of yore somewhat grayer and the deep lines of age more marked but as far as he could judge life might yet hang there for weeks to come sir lamda mewnew and sir omicron pie had thrice been wrong and might yet be wrong thrice again the old bishop slept during twenty of the twenty four hours but during the short periods of his waking moments he knew both his son and his dear old friend mr harding the archdeacon s father in law and would thank them tenderly for their care and love now he lay sleeping like a baby resting easily on his back his mouth just open and his few gray hairs straggling from beneath his cap his breath was perfectly noiseless and his thin wan hand which lay above the coverlid never moved nothing could be easier than the old man s passage from this world to the next but by no means easy were the emotions of him who sat there watching he knew it must be now or never he was already over fifty and there was little chance that his friends who were now leaving office would soon return to it no probable british prime minister but he who was now in he who was so soon to be out would think of making a bishop of dr

salutary one and the question was answered in a moment the proud wishful worldly man sank on his knees by the bedside and taking the bishop s hand within his own prayed eagerly that his sins might be forgiven him his face was still buried in the clothes when the door of the bedroom opened noiselessly and mr harding entered with a velvet step mr harding s attendance at that bedside had been nearly as constant as that of the archdeacon and his ingress and egress was as much a matter of course as that of his son in law he was standing close beside the archdeacon before he was perceived and would also have knelt in prayer had he not feared that his doing so might have caused some sudden start and have disturbed the dying man dr grantly however instantly perceived him and rose from his knees as he did so mr harding took both his hands and pressed them warmly there was more fellowship between them at that moment than there had ever been before and it so happened that after circumstances greatly preserved the feeling as they stood there pressing each other s hands the tears rolled freely down their cheeks god bless you my dears said the bishop with feeble voice as he woke god bless you may god bless you both my dear children and so he died there was no loud rattle in the throat no dreadful struggle no palpable sign of death but the lower jaw fell a little from its place and the eyes which had been so constantly closed in sleep now remained fixed and open neither mr harding nor dr grantly knew that life was gone though both suspected it i believe it s all over said mr harding still pressing the other s hands i think nay i hope it is i will ring the bell said the other speaking all but in a whisper mrs phillips should be here mrs phillips the nurse was soon in the room and immediately with practised hand closed those staring eyes it s all over mrs phillips asked mr harding my lord s no more said mrs phillips turning round and curtseying low with solemn face his lordship s gone more like a sleeping babby than any that i ever saw it s a great relief archdeacon said mr harding a great relief dear good excellent old man oh that our last moments may be as innocent and as peaceful as his surely said mrs phillips the lord be praised for all his mercies but for a meek mild gentle spoken christian his lordship was and mrs phillips with unaffected but easy grief put up her white apron to her flowing eyes you cannot but rejoice that it is over said mr harding still consoling his friend the archdeacon s mind however had already travelled from the death chamber to the closet of the prime minister he had brought himself to pray for his father s life but now that that life was done minutes were too precious to be lost it was now useless to dally with the fact of the bishop s death useless to lose perhaps everything for the pretence of a foolish sentiment but how was he to act while his father in law stood there holding his hand how without appearing unfeeling was he to forget his father in the bishop to overlook what he had lost and think only of what he might possibly gain no i suppose not said he at last in answer to mr harding we have all expected it so

an end to them and to himself charles had been a clever fellow a very clever fellow in the eyes of his father bernard amedroz knew that he himself was not a clever fellow and admired his son accordingly and when charles had been expelled from harrow for some boyish freak in his vengeance against a neighbouring farmer who had reported to the school authorities the doings of a few beagles upon his land charles had cut off the heads of all the trees in a young fir plantation his father was proud of the exploit when he was rusticated a second time from trinity and when the father received an intimation that his son s name had better be taken from the college books the squire was not so well pleased but even then he found some delight in the stories which reached him of his son s vagaries and when the young man commenced bohemian life in london his father did nothing to restrain him then there came the old story debts endless debts and lies endless lies during the two years before his death his father paid for him or undertook to pay nearly ten thousand pounds sacrificing the life assurances which were to have made provision for his daughter sacrificing to a great extent his own life income sacrificing everything so that the property might not be utterly ruined at his death that charles amedroz should be a brighter greater man than any other amedroz had still been the father s pride at the last visit which charles had paid to belton his father had called upon him to pledge himself solemnly that his sister should not be made to suffer by what had been done for him within a month of that time he had blown his brains out in his london lodgings thus making over the entire property to will belton at his father s death at that last pretended settlement with his father and his father s lawyer he had kept back the mention of debts as heavy nearly as those to which he had owned and there were debts of honour too of which he had not spoken trusting to the next event at newmarket to set him right the next event at newmarket had set him more wrong than ever and so there had come an end to everything with charles amedroz this had happened in the spring and the afflicted father afflicted with the double sorrow of his son s terrible death and his daughter s ruin had declared that he would turn his face to the wall and die but the old squire s health though far from strong was stronger than he had deemed it and his feelings sharp enough were less sharp than he had thought them and when a month had passed by he had discovered that it would be better that he should live in order that his daughter might still have bread to eat and a house of her own over her head though he was now an impoverished man there was still left to him the means of keeping up the old home and he told himself that it must if possible be so kept that a few pounds annually might be put by for clara the old carriage horses were sold and the park was let to a farmer up to the hall door of the castle so much the squire could do but as to the putting by of the few pounds any dependence on such exertion as that on his part would we may say be very precarious belton castle was not in truth a castle immediately before the front door so near to the house as merely to allow of a broad road running between it and the entrance porch there stood an old tower which gave its name to the residence an old square tower up which the amedroz boys for three generations had been able to climb by means of the ivy and broken stones in one of the inner corners and this tower was a remnant of a real castle that had once protected the village of belton the house itself was an ugly residence three stories high built in the time of george ii with low rooms and long passages and an immense number of doors it was a large unattractive house unattractive that is as regarded its own attributes but made interesting by the beauty of the small park in which it stood belton park did not perhaps contain much above a hundred acres but the land was so broken into knolls and valleys in so many places was the rock seen to be cropping up through the verdure there were in it so many stunted old oaks so many points of vantage for the lover of scenery that no one would believe it to be other than a considerable domain the farmer who took it and who would not under any circumstances undertake to pay more than seventeen shillings an acre for it could not be made to think that it was in any way considerable but belton park since first it was made a park had never before been regarded after this fashion farmer stovey of the grange was the first man of that class who had ever assumed the right to pasture his sheep in belton chase as the people around were still accustomed

again going about their ordinary business and the shop girls with their lovers from redicote were again to be seen walking among the oaks in the park on a sunday evening and the world in that district

representative of a family so much more ancient and important than his own without conceiving that he in any respect degraded himself by doing so mr bridgenorth did not however carry his complaisance so far as to embrace sir geoffrey s side during the civil war on the contrary as an active justice of the peace he rendered much assistance in arraying the militia in the cause of the parliament and for some time held a military commission in that service this was partly owing to his religious principles for he was a zealous presbyterian partly to his political ideas which without being absolutely democratical favoured the popular side of the great national question besides he was a moneyed man and to a certain extent had a shrewd eye to his worldly interest he understood how to improve the opportunities which civil war afforded of advancing his fortune by a dexterous use of his capital and he was not at a loss to perceive that these were likely to be obtained in joining the parliament while the king s cause as it was managed held out nothing to the wealthy but a course of exaction and compulsory loans for these reasons bridgenorth became a decided roundhead and all friendly communication betwixt his neighbour and him was abruptly broken asunder this was done with the less acrimony that during the civil war sir geoffrey was almost constantly in the field following the vacillating and unhappy fortunes of his master while major bridgenorth who soon renounced active military service resided chiefly in london and only occasionally visited the hall upon these visits it was with great pleasure he received the intelligence that lady peveril had shown much kindness to mrs bridgenorth and had actually given her and her family shelter in martindale castle when moultrassie hall was threatened with pillage by a body of prince rupert s ill disciplined cavaliers this acquaintance had been matured by frequent walks together which the vicinity of their places of residence suffered the lady peveril to have with mrs bridgenorth who deemed herself much honoured in being thus admitted into the society of so distinguished a lady major bridgenorth heard of this growing intimacy with great pleasure and he determined to repay the obligation as far as he could without much hurt to himself by interfering with all his influence in behalf of her unfortunate husband it was chiefly owing to major bridgenorth s mediation that sir geoffrey s life was saved after the battle of worcester he obtained him permission to compound for his estate on easier terms than many who had been less obstinate in malignancy and finally when in order to raise the money to the composition the knight was obliged to sell a considerable portion of his patrimony major bridgenorth became the purchaser and that at a larger price than had been paid to any cavalier under such circumstances by a member of the committee for sequestrations it is true the prudent committeeman did not by any means lose sight of his own interest in the transaction for the price was after all very moderate and the property lay adjacent to moultrassie hall the value of which was at least trebled by the acquisition but then it was also true that the unfortunate owner must have submitted to much worse conditions had the committeeman used as others did the full advantages which his situation gave him and bridgenorth took credit to himself and received it from others for having on this occasion fairly sacrificed his interest to his liberality sir geoffrey peveril was of the same opinion and the rather that mr bridgenorth seemed to bear his exaltation with great moderation and was disposed to show him personally the same deference in his present sunshine of prosperity which he had exhibited formerly in their early acquaintance it is but justice to major bridgenorth to observe that in this conduct he paid respect as much to the misfortunes as to the pretensions of his far descended neighbour and that with the frank generosity of a blunt englishman he conceded points of ceremony about which he himself was indifferent merely because he saw that his doing so gave pleasure to sir geoffrey peveril of the peak did justice to his neighbour s delicacy in consideration of which he forgot many things he forgot that major bridgenorth was already in possession of a fair third of his estate and had various pecuniary claims affecting the remainder to the extent of one third more he endeavoured even to forget what it was still more difficult not to remember the altered situation in which they and their mansions now stood to each other before the civil war the superb battlements and turrets of martindale castle looked down on the red brick built hall as it stole out from the green plantations just as an oak in martindale chase would have looked beside one of the stunted and formal young beech trees with which bridgenorth had graced

seven and thirty feet in length and she carried a gun with a laudable view of enhancing his country s naval pride when people inquired her size lieutenant belaye replied oh my ship my ship is the first of the hundred and seventy ones which meant her tonnage but people imagined it meant her guns whenever i went on board he would beckon me down below come down little buttercup come for he loved to call me so and he d tell of the fights at sea in which he d taken a part and so lieutenant belaye won poor poll pineapple s heart but at length his orders came and he said one day said he i m

street with plenty of cheap cheap shops and i bought an oilskin hat and a second hand suit of slops and i went to lieutenant belaye and he never suspected me and i entered myself as a chap as wanted to go to sea we sailed that afternoon at the mystic hour of one remarkably nice young men were the crew of the hot cross bun i m sorry to say that i ve heard that sailors sometimes swear but i never yet heard a bun say anything wrong i declare when jack tars meet they meet with a messmate ho what cheer but here on the hot cross bun it was how do you do my dear when jack tars growl i believe they growl with a big big d but the strongest oath of the hot cross buns was a mild dear me yet though they were all well bred you could scarcely call them slick whenever a sea was on they were all extremely sick and whenever the weather was calm and the wind was light and fair they spent more time than a sailor should on his back back hair they certainly shivered and shook when ordered aloft to run and they screamed when lieutenant belaye discharged his only gun and as he was proud of his gun such pride is hardly wrong the lieutenant was blazing away at intervals all day long they all agreed very well though at times you heard it said that bill had a way of his own of making his lips look red that joe looked quite his age or somebody might declare that barnacle s long pig tail was never his own own hair belaye would admit that his men were of no great use to him but then he would say there is little to do on a gunboat trim i can hand and reef and steer and fire my big gun too and it is such a treat to sail with a gentle well bred crew i saw him every day how the happy moments sped reef topsails make all taut there s dirty weather ahead i do not mean that tempests threatened the

week had passed and it seemed like a life lieutenant belaye returned to his ship with a fair young wife he up and he says says he o crew of the hot cross bun here is the wife of my heart for the church has made us one and as he uttered the word the crew went out of their wits and all fell down in so many separate fainting fits and then their hair came down or off as the case might be and lo

proprietor of the chateau which had so attracted his admiration and was equally surprised and pleased at hearing in reply a nobleman named whom we shall call lord woodville how fortunate much of browne s early recollections both at school and at college had been connected with young woodville whom by a few questions he now ascertained to be the same with the owner of this fair domain he had been raised to the peerage by the decease of his father a few months before and as the general learned from the landlord the term of mourning being ended was now taking possession of his paternal estate in the jovial season of merry autumn accompanied by a select party of friends to enjoy the sports of a country famous for game this was delightful news to our traveller frank woodville had been richard browne s fag at eton and his chosen intimate at christ church their pleasures and their tasks had been the same and the honest soldier s heart warmed to find his early friend in possession of so delightful a residence and of an estate as the landlord assured him with a nod and a wink fully adequate to maintain and add to his dignity nothing was more natural than that the traveller should suspend a journey which there was nothing to render hurried to pay a visit to an old friend under such agreeable circumstances the fresh horses therefore had only the brief task of conveying the general s travelling carriage to woodville castle a porter admitted them at a modern gothic lodge built in that style to correspond with the castle itself and at the same time rang a bell to give warning of the approach of visitors apparently the sound of the bell had suspended the separation of the company bent on the various amusements of the morning for on entering the court of the chateau several young men were lounging about in their sporting dresses looking at and criticizing the dogs which the keepers held in readiness to attend their pastime as general browne alighted the young lord came to the gate of the hall and for an instant gazed as at a stranger upon the countenance of his friend on which war with its fatigues and its wounds had made a great alteration but the uncertainty lasted no longer than till the visitor had spoken and the hearty greeting which followed was such as can only be exchanged betwixt those who have passed together the merry days of careless boyhood or early youth if i could have formed a wish my dear browne said lord woodville it would have been to have you here of all men upon this occasion which my friends are good enough to hold as a sort of holiday do not think you have been unwatched during the years you have been absent from us i have traced you through your dangers your triumphs your misfortunes and was delighted to see that whether in victory or defeat the name of my old friend was always distinguished with applause the general made a suitable reply and congratulated his friend on his new dignities and the possession of a place and domain so beautiful nay you have seen nothing of it as yet said lord woodville and i trust you do not mean to leave us till you are better acquainted with it it is true i confess that my present party is pretty large and the old house like other places of the kind does not possess so much accommodation as the extent of the outward walls appears to promise but we can give you a comfortable old fashioned room and i venture to suppose that your campaigns have taught you to be glad of worse quarters the general shrugged his shoulders and laughed i presume he said the worst apartment in your chateau is considerably superior to the old tobacco cask in which i was fain to take up my night s lodging when i was in the bush as the virginians call it with the light corps there i lay like diogenes himself so delighted with my covering from the elements that i made a vain attempt to have it rolled on to my next quarters but my commander for the time would give way to no such luxurious provision and i took farewell of my beloved cask with tears in my eyes well then since you do not fear your quarters said lord woodville you will stay with me a week at least of guns dogs fishing rods flies and means of sport by sea and land we have enough and to spare you cannot pitch on an amusement but we will find the means of pursuing it but if you prefer the gun and pointers i will go with you myself and see whether you have mended your shooting since you have been amongst the indians of the back settlements the general gladly accepted his friendly host s proposal in all its points after a morning of manly exercise the company met at dinner where it was the delight of lord woodville to conduce to the display of the high properties of his recovered friend so as to recommend him to his guests most of whom were persons of distinction he led general browne to speak of the scenes he had witnessed and as every word marked alike the brave officer and the sensible man who retained possession of his cool judgment under the most imminent dangers the company looked upon the soldier with general respect as on one who had proved himself possessed of an uncommon portion of personal courage that attribute of all others of which everybody desires to be thought possessed the day at woodville castle ended as usual in such mansions the hospitality stopped within the limits of good order music in which the young lord was a proficient succeeded to the circulation of the bottle cards and billiards for those who preferred such amusements were in readiness but the

the truth wife i should not wonder if some terrible thing were to happen to all the people in the village unless they mend their manners but as for you and me so long as providence affords us a crust of bread let us be ready to give half to any poor homeless stranger that may come along and need it that s right husband said baucis so we will these old folks you must know were quite poor and had to work pretty hard for a living old philemon toiled diligently in his garden while baucis was always busy with her distaff or making a little butter and cheese with their cow s milk or doing one thing and another about the cottage their food was seldom anything but bread milk and vegetables with sometimes a portion of honey from their beehive and now and then a bunch of grapes that had ripened against the cottage wall but they were two of the kindest old people in the world and would cheerfully have gone without their dinners any day rather than refuse a slice of their brown loaf a cup of new milk and a spoonful of honey to the weary traveller who might pause before their door they felt as if such guests had a sort of holiness and that they ought therefore to treat them better and more bountifully than their own selves their cottage stood on a rising ground at some short distance from a village which lay in a hollow valley that was about half a mile in breadth this valley in past ages when the world was new had probably been the bed of a lake there fishes had glided to and fro in the depths and water weeds had grown along the margin and trees and hills had seen their reflected images in the broad and peaceful mirror but as the waters subsided men had cultivated the soil and built houses on it so that it was now a fertile spot and bore no traces of the ancient lake except a very small brook which meandered through the midst of the village and supplied the inhabitants with water the valley had been dry land so long that oaks had sprung up and grown great and high and perished with old age and been succeeded by others as tall and stately as the first never was there a prettier or more fruitful valley the very sight of the plenty around them should have made the inhabitants kind and gentle and ready to show their gratitude to providence by doing good to their fellow creatures but we are sorry to say the people of this lovely village were not worthy to dwell in a spot on which heaven had smiled so beneficently they were a very selfish and hard hearted people and had no pity for the poor nor sympathy with the homeless they would only have laughed had anybody told them that human beings owe a debt of love to one another because there is no other method of paying the debt of love and care which all of us owe to providence you will hardly believe what i am going to tell you these naughty people taught their children to be no better than themselves and used to clap their hands by way of encouragement when they saw the little boys and girls run after some poor stranger shouting at his heels and pelting hum with stones they kept large and fierce dogs and whenever a traveller ventured to show himself in the village street this pack of disagreeable curs scampered to meet him barking snarling and showing their teeth then they would seize him by his leg or by his clothes just as it happened and if he were ragged when he came he was generally a pitiable object before he had time to run away this was a very terrible thing to poor travellers as you may suppose especially when they chanced to be sick or feeble or lame or old such persons if they once knew how badly these unkind people and their unkind children and curs were in the habit of behaving would go miles and miles out of their way rather than try to pass through the village again what made the matter seem worse if possible was that when rich persons came in their chariots or riding on beautiful horses with their servants in rich liveries attending on them nobody could be more civil and obsequious than the inhabitants of the village they would take off their hats and make the humblest bows you ever saw if the children were rude they were pretty certain to get their ears boxed and as for the dogs if a single cur in the pack presumed to yelp his master instantly beat him with a club and tied him up without any supper this would have been all very well only it proved that the villagers cared much about the money that a stranger had in his pocket and nothing whatever for the human soul which lives equally in the beggar and the prince so now you can understand why old philemon spoke so sorrowfully when he heard the shouts of the children and the barking of the dogs at the farther extremity of the village street there was a confused din which lasted a good while and seemed to pass quite through the breadth of the valley i never heard the dogs so loud observed the good old man nor the children so rude answered his good old wife they sat shaking their heads one to another while the noise came nearer and nearer until at the foot of the little eminence on which their cottage stood they saw two travellers approaching on foot close behind them came the fierce dogs snarling at their very heels a little farther off ran a crowd of children who sent up shrill cries and flung stones at the two strangers with all their might once or twice the younger of the two men he was a slender and very active figure turned about and drove back the dogs with a staff which he carried in his hand his companion who was a very tall person walked calmly

was played for the first time on december with braham and harley in the cast in his preface to the play published contemporaneously by richard bentley and dedicated to harley dickens explained that the libretto of an opera must be to a certain extent a mere vehicle for the music and that it is scarcely fair or reasonable to judge it by those strict rules of criticism which would be justly applicable to a five act tragedy or a finished comedy there is no doubt that the merits of the play were based upon the songs set to hullah s music rather than upon the play itself and it is said that harley s reputation as a vocalist was established by his able rendering of them the village coquettes enjoyed a run of nineteen nights in london during the season and was then transferred to edinburgh where it was performed under the management of mr ramsay a friend of sir walter scott sala as a boy of ten witnessed its first representation in london and ever retained a vivid impression of the event while especial interest appertains to the fact that a copy of the play became the means of first bringing dickens into personal communication with john forster his life long friend and biographer it is more than probable that boz felt a little elated by the reception accorded by the public to the dramatic bantling but as time progressed he realised that the somewhat unfavourable comments of the critics were not entirely devoid of truth indeed when in it was proposed to revive the play he expressed a hope that it might be allowed to sink into its native obscurity i did it he explained in a fit of damnable good nature long ago for hullah who wrote some very pretty music to it i just put down for everybody what everybody at the st james s theatre wanted to say and do and what they could say and do best and i have been most sincerely repentant ever since the novelist confessed that both the operetta and a little farce called the strange gentleman the latter written as a practical joke for the st james s theatre about the same time were done without the least consideration or regard to reputation he also declared that he wouldn t repeat them for a thousand pounds apiece and devoutly wished these early dramatic efforts to be forgotten x propos of this the late frederick locker lampson has recorded that when he asked dickens about a year before the great writer s death whether he possessed a copy of the village coquettes his reply was no and if i knew it was in my house and if i could not get rid of it in any other way i would burn the wing of the house where it was although perhaps not of a high order of merit the village coquettes is not without bibliographical interest and may be regarded as a musical and literary curiosity copies of the first

eighteen hundred and no matter what now this james is to be our hero and he is just the hero for a sensation at least so you would have thought if you had been in newbury the week after his arrival master james was one of those whole hearted energetic yankees who rise in the world as naturally as cork does in water he possessed a great share of that characteristic national trait so happily denominated cuteness which signifies an ability to do every thing without trying and to know every thing without learning and to make more use of one s ignorance than other people do of their knowledge this quality in james was mingled with an elasticity of animal spirits a buoyant cheerfulness of mind which though found in the new england character perhaps as often as any where else is not ordinarily regarded as one of its distinguishing traits as to the personal appearance of our hero we have not much to say of it not half so much as the girls in newbury found it necessary to remark the first sabbath that he shone out in the meeting house there was a saucy frankness of countenance a knowing roguery of eye a joviality and prankishness of demeanor that was wonderfully captivating especially to the ladies it is true that master james had an uncommonly comfortable opinion of himself a full faith that there was nothing in creation that he could not learn and could not do and this faith was maintained with an abounding and triumphant joyfulness that fairly carried your sympathies along with him and made you feel quite as much delighted with his qualifications and prospects as he felt himself there are two kinds of self sufficiency one is amusing and the other is provoking his was the amusing kind it seemed in truth to be only the buoyancy and overflow of a vivacious mind delighted with every thing delightful in himself or others he was always ready to magnify his own praise but quite as ready to exalt his neighbor if the channel of discourse ran that way his own perfections being more completely within his knowledge he rejoiced in them more constantly but if those of any one else came within the same range he was quite as much astonished and edified as if they had been his own master james at the time of his transit to the town of newbury was only eighteen years of age so that it was difficult to say which predominated in him most the boy or the man the belief that he could and the determination that he would be something in the world had caused him to abandon his home and with all his worldly effects tied in a blue cotton pocket

head lay all day upon the pillow and hers all night beside it how long poor mr toothaker was kept in misery death seemed to draw near the door and often to lift the latch and sometimes to thrust his ugly skull into the chamber nodding to rose and pointing at her husband but still delayed to enter this bedridden wretch cannot escape me quoth death i will go forth and run a race with the swift and fight a battle with the strong and come back for toothaker at my leisure o when the deliverer came so near in the dull anguish of her worn out sympathies did she never long to cry death come in but no we have no right to ascribe such a wish to our friend rose she never failed in a wife s duty to her poor sick husband she murmured not though a glimpse of the sunny sky was as strange to her as him nor answered peevishly though his complaining accents roused her from her sweetest dream only to share his wretchedness he knew her faith yet nourished a cankered jealousy and when the slow disease had chilled all his heart save one lukewarm spot which death s frozen fingers were searching for his last words were what would my rose have done for her first love if she has been so true and kind to a sick old man like me and then his poor soul crept away and left the body lifeless though hardly more so than for years before and rose a widow though in truth it was the wedding night that widowed her she felt glad it must be owned when mr toothaker was buried because his corpse had retained such a likeness to the man half alive that she hearkened for the sad murmur of his voice bidding her shift his pillow but all through the next winter though the grave had held him many a month she fancied him calling from that cold bed rose rose come put a blanket on my feet so now the rosebud was the widow toothaker her troubles had come early and tedious as they seemed had passed before all her bloom was fled she was still fair enough to captivate a bachelor or with a widow s cheerful gravity she might have won a widower stealing into his heart in the very guise of his dead wife but the widow toothaker had no such projects by her watchings and continual cares her heart had become knit to her first husband with a constancy which changed its very nature and made her love him for his infirmities and infirmity for his sake when the palsied old man was gone even her early lover could not have supplied his place she had dwelt in a sick chamber and been the companion of a half dead wretch till she could scarcely breathe in a free air and felt ill at ease with the healthy and the happy she missed the fragrance of the doctor s stuff she walked the chamber with a noiseless footfall if visitors came in she spoke in soft and soothing accents and was startled and shocked by their loud voices often in the lonesome evening she looked timorously from the fireside to the bed with almost a hope of recognizing a ghastly face upon the pillow then went her thoughts sadly to her husband s grave if one impatient throb bad wronged him in his lifetime if she had secretly repined because her buoyant youth was imprisoned with his torpid age if ever while slumbering beside him a treacherous dream had admitted another into her heart yet the sick man had been preparing a revenge which the dead now claimed on his painful pillow he had cast a spell around her his groans and misery had proved more captivating charms than gayety and youthful grace in his semblance disease itself had won the rosebud for a bride nor could his death dissolve the nuptials by that indissoluble bond she had gained a home in every sick chamber

conclusion index geological observations on south america by charles darwin critical introduction of the remarkable trilogy constituted by darwin s writings which deal with the geology of the beagle the member which has perhaps attracted least attention up to the present time is that which treats of the geology of south america the actual writing of this book appears to have occupied darwin a shorter period than either of the other volumes of the series his diary records that the work was accomplished within ten months namely between july and april but the book was not actually issued till late in the year following the preface bearing the date september altogether as darwin informs us in his autobiography the geological books consumed four and a half years steady work most of the remainder of the ten years that elapsed between the return of the beagle and the completion of his geological books being it is sad to relate lost through illness concerning the geological observations on south america darwin wrote to his friend lyell as follows my volume will be about pages dreadfully dull yet much condensed i think whenever you have time to look through it you will think the collection of facts on the elevation of the land and on the formation of terraces pretty good much condensed is the verdict that everyone must endorse on rising from the perusal of this remarkable book but by no means dull the three and a half years from april to september were spent by darwin in south america and were devoted to continuous scientific work the problems he dealt with were either purely geological or those which constitute the borderland between the geological and biological sciences it is impossible to read the journal which he kept during this time without being impressed by the conviction that it contains all the germs of thought which afterwards developed into the origin of species but it is equally evident that after his return to england biological speculations gradually began to exercise a more exclusive sway over darwin s mind and tended to dispossess geology which during the actual period of the voyage certainly engrossed most of his time and attention the wonderful series of observations made during those three and a half years in south america could scarcely be done justice to in the pages devoted to their exposition that he executed the work of preparing the book on south america in somewhat the manner of a task is shown by many references in his letters writing to sir joseph hooker in he says i hope this next summer to finish my south american geology then to get out a little zoology and hurrah for my species work it would seem that the feeling of disappointment which darwin so often experienced in comparing a book when completed with the observations and speculations which had inspired it was more keenly felt in the case of his volume on south america than any other to one friend he writes i have of late been slaving extra hard to the great discomfiture of wretched digestive organs at south america and thank all the fates i have done three fourths of it writing plain english grows with me more and more difficult and never attainable as for your pretending that you will read anything so dull as my pure geological descriptions lay not such a flattering unction on my soul for it is incredible to another friend he writes you do not know what you threaten when you propose to read it it is purely geological i

jesse foot surgeon in this book we find several incidents similar to ones in the story bowes cut down all the timber on his wife s estate but the neighbours would not buy it such practical jokes as barry lyndon played upon his son s tutor were played by bowes on his chaplain the story of stoney and his marriage will be found briefly given in the notice of the countess s life in the dictionary of

his adventures on his journey to dublin chapter iii was a notorious highwayman on whose doings thackeray had enlarged in the fifteenth chapter of his irish sketch book despite the slowness with which it was written and the seeming neglect with which it was permitted to remain unreprinted barry lyndon was to be hailed by competent critics as one of thackeray s finest performances though the author himself seems to have had no strong regard for the story his daughter has recorded my father once said to me when i was a girl you needn t read barry lyndon you won t like it indeed it is scarcely a book to like but one to admire and to wonder at for its consummate power and mastery another novelist anthony trollope has said of it in imagination language construction and general literary capacity thackeray never did anything more remarkable than barry lyndon mr leslie stephen says all later critics have recognised in this book one of his most powerful performances in directness and vigour he never surpassed it w j the memoires of barry lyndon esq chapter i my pedigree and family undergo the influence of the tender passion since the days of adam there has been hardly a mischief done in this world but a woman has been at the bottom of it ever since ours was a family and that must be very near adam s time so old noble and illustrious are the barrys as everybody knows women have played a mighty part with the destinies of our race i presume that there is no gentleman in europe that has not heard of the house of barry of barryogue of the kingdom of ireland than which a more famous name is not to be found in gwillim or d hozier and though as a man of the world i have learned to despise heartily the claims of some pretenders to high birth who have no more genealogy than the lacquey who cleans my boots and though i laugh to utter scorn the boasting of many of my countrymen who are all for descending from kings of ireland and talk of a domain no bigger than would feed a pig as if it were a principality yet truth compels me to assert that my family was the noblest of the island and perhaps of the universal world while their possessions now insignificant and torn from us by war by treachery by the loss of time by ancestral extravagance by adhesion to the old faith and monarch were formerly prodigious and embraced many counties at a time when ireland was vastly more prosperous than now i would assume the irish crown over my coat of arms but that there are so many silly pretenders to that distinction who bear it and render it common who knows but for the fault of a woman i might have been wearing it now you start with incredulity i say why not had there been a gallant chief to lead my countrymen instead or puling knaves who bent the knee to king richard ii they might have been freemen had there been a resolute leader to meet the murderous ruffian oliver cromwell we should have shaken off the english for ever but there was no barry in the field against the usurper on the contrary my ancestor simon de bary came over with the first named monarch and married the daughter of the then king of munster whose sons in battle he pitilessly slew in oliver s time it was too late for a chief of the name of barry to lift up his war cry against that of the murderous brewer we were princes of the land no longer our unhappy race had lost its possessions a century previously and by the most shameful treason this i know to be the fact for my mother has often told me the story and besides had worked it in a worsted pedigree which hung up in the yellow saloon at barryville where we lived that very estate which the lyndons now possess in ireland was once the property of my race rory barry of barryogue owned it in elizabeth s time and half munster beside the barry was always in feud with the o mahonys in those times and as it happened a certain english colonel passed through the former s country with a body of men at arms on the very day when the o mahonys had made an inroad upon our territories and carried off a frightful plunder of our flocks and herds this young englishman whose name was roger lyndon linden or lyndaine having been most

archdeacon their own private knowledge that the ministry must fall within five days the son returned to his father s room and after administering with his own hands the sustaining modicum of madeira sat down by the bedside to calculate his chances the ministry were to be out within five days his father was to be dead within no he rejected that view of the subject the ministry were to be out and the diocese might probably be vacant at the same period there was much doubt as to the names of the men who were to succeed to power and a week must elapse before a cabinet was formed would not vacancies be filled by the outgoing men during this week dr grantly had a kind of idea that such would be the case but did not know and then he wondered at his own ignorance on such a question he tried to keep his mind away from the subject but he could not the race was so very close and the stakes were so very high he then looked at the dying man s impassive placid face there was no sign there of death or disease it was something thinner than of yore somewhat grayer and the deep lines of age more marked but as far as he could judge life might yet hang there for weeks to come sir lamda mewnew and sir omicron pie had thrice been wrong and might yet be wrong thrice again the old bishop slept during twenty of the twenty four hours but during the short periods of his waking moments he knew both his son and his dear old friend mr harding the archdeacon s father in law and would thank them tenderly for their care and love now he lay sleeping like a baby resting easily on his back his mouth just open and his few gray hairs straggling from beneath his cap his breath was perfectly noiseless and his thin wan hand which lay above the coverlid never moved nothing could be easier than the old man s passage from this world to the next but by no means easy were the emotions of him who sat there watching he knew it must be now or never he was already over fifty and there was little chance that his friends who were now leaving office would soon return to it no probable british prime minister but he who was now in he who was so soon to be out would think of making a bishop of dr grantly thus he thought long and sadly in deep silence and then gazed at that still living face and then at last dared to ask himself whether he really longed for his father s death the effort was a salutary one and the question was answered in a moment the proud wishful worldly man sank on his knees by the bedside and taking the bishop s hand within his own prayed eagerly that his sins might be forgiven him his face was still buried in the clothes when the door of the bedroom opened noiselessly and mr harding entered with a velvet step mr harding s attendance at that bedside had been nearly as constant as that of the archdeacon and his ingress and egress was as much a matter of course as that of his son in law he was standing close beside the archdeacon before he was perceived and would also have knelt in prayer had he not feared that his doing so might have caused some sudden start and have disturbed the dying man dr grantly however instantly perceived him and rose from his knees as he did so mr harding took both his hands and pressed them warmly there was more fellowship between them at that moment than there had ever been before and it so happened that after circumstances greatly preserved the feeling as they stood there pressing each other s hands the tears rolled freely down their cheeks god bless you my dears said the bishop with feeble voice as he woke god bless you may god bless you both my dear children and so he died there was no loud rattle in the throat no dreadful struggle no palpable sign of death but the lower jaw fell a little from its place and the eyes which had been so constantly closed in sleep now remained fixed and open neither mr harding nor dr grantly knew that life was gone though both suspected it i believe it s all over said mr harding still pressing the other s hands i think nay i hope it is i will ring the bell said the other speaking all but in a whisper mrs phillips should be here mrs phillips the nurse was soon in the room and immediately with practised hand closed those staring eyes it s all over mrs phillips asked mr harding my lord s no more said mrs phillips turning round and curtseying low with solemn face his lordship s gone more like a sleeping babby than any that i ever saw it s a great relief archdeacon said mr harding a great relief dear good excellent old man oh that our last moments may be as innocent and as peaceful as his surely said mrs phillips the lord be praised for all his mercies but for a meek mild gentle spoken christian his lordship was and mrs phillips with unaffected but easy grief put up her white apron to her flowing eyes you cannot but rejoice that it is over said mr harding still consoling his friend the archdeacon s mind however had already travelled from the death chamber to the closet of the prime minister he had brought himself to pray for his father s life but now that that life was done minutes were too precious to be lost it was now useless to dally with the fact of the bishop s death useless to lose perhaps everything for the pretence of a foolish sentiment but how was he to act while his father in law stood there holding his hand how without appearing unfeeling was he to forget his father in the bishop to overlook what he had lost and think only of what he might possibly gain no i suppose not said he at last in answer to mr harding we have all expected it so

train his mind were within his reach no school no university no legal faculty had any part in training his powers when he became a lawyer and a politician the years most favourable to continuous study had already passed and the opportunities he found for reading were very scanty he knew but few authors in general literature though he knew those few thoroughly he taught himself a little mathematics but he could read no language save his own and can have had only the faintest acquaintance with european history or with any branch of philosophy the want of regular education was not made up for by the persons among whom his lot was cast till he was a grown man he never moved in any society from which he could learn those things with which the mind of an orator or a statesman ought to be stored even after he had gained some legal practice there was for many years no one for him to mix with except the petty practitioners of a petty town men nearly all of whom knew little more than he did himself schools gave him nothing and society gave him nothing but he had a powerful intellect and a resolute will isolation fostered not only self reliance but the habit of reflection and indeed of prolonged and intense reflection he made all that he knew a part of himself he thought everything out for himself his convictions were his own clear and coherent he was not positive or opinionated and he did not deny that at certain moments he pondered and hesitated long before he decided on his course but though he could keep a policy in suspense waiting for events to guide him he did not waver he paused and reconsidered but it was never his way either to go back upon a decision once made or to waste time in vain regrets that all he expected had not been attained he took advice readily and left many things to his ministers but he did not lean upon his advisers without vanity or ostentation he was always independent self contained prepared to take full responsibility for his acts that he was keenly observant of all that passed under his eyes that his mind played freely round everything it touched we know from the accounts of his talk which first made him famous in the town and neighbourhood where he lived his humour and his memory for anecdotes which he could bring out to good purpose at the right moment are qualities which europe deems distinctively american but no great man of action in the nineteenth century even in america possessed them in the same measure seldom has so acute a power of observation been found united to so abundant a power of sympathy these remarks may seem to belong to a study of his character rather than of his speeches yet they are not irrelevant because the interest of his speeches lies in their revelation of his character let us however return to the speeches and to the letters some of which given in this volume are scarcely less noteworthy than are the speeches what are the distinctive merits of these speeches and letters there is less humour in them than his reputation as a humorist would have led us to expect they are serious grave practical we feel that the man does not care to play over the surface of the subject or to use it as a way of displaying his cleverness he is trying to get right down to the very foundation of the matter and tell us what his real thoughts about it are in this respect he sometimes reminds us of bismarck s speeches which in their rude broken forth darting way always go straight to their destined aim always hit the nail on the head so too in their effort to grapple with fundamental facts lincoln s bear a sort of likeness to cromwell s speeches though cromwell has far less power of utterance and always seems to be wrestling with the difficulty of finding language to convey to others what is plain true and weighty to himself this difficulty makes the great protector though we can usually see what he is driving at frequently confused and obscure lincoln however is always clear simplicity directness and breadth are the notes of his thought aptness clearness and again simplicity are the notes of his diction the american speakers of his generation like most of those of the preceding generation but unlike those of that earlier generation to which alexander hamilton john adams marshall and madison belonged were generally infected by a floridity which made them a by word in europe even men of brilliant talent such as edward everett were by no means free from this straining after effect by highly coloured phrases and theatrical effects such faults have to day virtually vanished from the united states largely from a change in public taste to which perhaps the example set by lincoln himself may have contributed in the forties and fifties florid rhetoric was rampant especially in the west and south where taste was less polished than in the older states that lincoln escaped it is a striking mark of his independence as well as of his greatness there is no superfluous ornament in his orations nothing tawdry nothing otiose for the most part he addresses the reason of his hearers and credits them with desiring to have none but solid arguments laid before them when he does appeal to emotion he does it quietly perhaps even solemnly the note struck is always a high note the impressiveness of the appeal comes not from fervid vehemence of language but from the sincerity of his own convictions sometimes one can see that through its whole course the argument is suffused by the speaker s feeling and when the time comes for the feeling to be directly expressed it glows not with fitful flashes but with the steady heat of an intense and strenuous soul the impression which most of the speeches leave on the reader is that their matter has been carefully thought over even when the words have not been learn

and some good dogs who are just as likely to be friends as his boy companions he ought to be much happier than an ordinary king a forest is a fine place at any time but when the ground is well covered with snow especially if there is a hard crust upon it the woods seem to possess a peculiar charm you can go anywhere then in the summer the thick undergrowth the intertwining vines and the heavy lower branches of the trees make it difficult even to see into the dark recesses of the forest but in the winter all is open the low wet places the deep holes the rotten bogs everything on the ground that is in the way of a good run and a jump is covered up you do not walk a hundred yards under the bare branches of the trees before up starts a rabbit or a hare if you would rather call him by his right name and away go the dogs and away you go all of you tearing along at the top of your speed but poor bunny has a small chance when a hard snow is on the ground his hiding places are all covered up and before he knows it the dogs have caught him and your mother will have stewed rabbit for supper it seems a hard fate for the poor little fellow but he was born partly for that purpose when you have caught your rabbit and come back to where the men are cutting wood you will be just as proud to tell the boy who is cutting up the branches all about your splendid hunt as if you had chased and killed a stag there s where we started him you will cry and away he scudded over there among the chestnuts and rover right at his heels and when we got down there to the creek rover turned heels over head on the ice he was going so fast but i gave one slide right across and just up there by the big walnut the other two dogs got him that boy is almost as much excited as you are and he would drop his axe in one minute and be off with you on another chase if his father were not there and now you find that you have reached the wood cutters exactly in time for that great tree is just about to come down there go the top branches moving slowly along through the tops of the other trees and now they move faster and everything begins to crack and with a rush and a clatter of breaking limbs the great oak comes crashing down jarring the very earth beneath your feet and making the snow fly about like a sparkling cloud while away run the dogs with their tails between their legs the tree is down now and you will want to be home in time for dinner farmer brown s sled has just passed and if you will cut across the woods you can catch up with him and have a ride home and tell him all about the rabbit hunt on the way if it is saturday and a holiday you will be out again this afternoon with some of the other boys perhaps and have a grand hunt suppose it is snowing what will you care you will not mind the snow any more than if it were a shower of blossoms from the apple trees in may tricks of light illustration there is nothing more straightforward in its ways than light when we let it alone but like many of us when it is introduced to the inventions and contrivances of the civilized world it often becomes exceedingly fond of vagaries and extravagances of all the companions of light which endeavor to induce it to forsake its former simple habits there is not one which has the influence possessed by glass when light and glass get together it is difficult to divine what tricks they are

between it and the spectators so that they do not see how the pictures are produced it is mounted on castors so that at times it can be brought nearer and nearer to the screen until the picture seems

nor worse than other people s sympathy nevertheless as mortal man must have something in the guise of sympathy and whether the true metal or merely copper washed is of less moment i choose rather to content myself with monsieur du miroir s such as it is than to seek the sterling coin and perhaps miss even the counterfeit in my age of vanities i have often seen him in the ballroom and might again were i to seek him there we have encountered each other at the tremont theatre where however he took his seat neither in the dress circle pit nor upper regions nor threw a single glance at the stage though the brightest star even fanny kemble herself might be culminating there no this whimsical friend of mine chose to linger in the saloon near one of the large looking glasses which throw back their pictures of the illuminated room he is so full of these unaccountable eccentricities that i never like to notice monsieur du miroir nor to acknowledge the slightest connection with him in places of public resort he however has no scruple about claiming my acquaintance even when his common sense if he had any might teach him that i would as willingly exchange a nod with the old nick it was but the other day that he got into a large brass kettle at the entrance of a hardware store and thrust his head the moment afterwards into a bright new warming pan whence he gave me a most merciless look of recognition he smiled and so did i but these childish tricks make decent people rather shy of monsieur du miroir and subject him to more dead cuts than any other gentleman in town one of this singular person s most remarkable peculiarities is his fondness for water wherein he excels any temperance man whatever his pleasure it must be owned is not so much to drink it in which respect a very moderate quantity will answer his occasions as to souse himself over head and ears wherever he may meet with it perhaps he is a merman or born of a mermaid s marriage with a mortal and thus amphibious by hereditary right like the children which the old river deities or nymphs of fountains gave to earthly love when no cleaner bathing place happened to be at hand i have seen the foolish fellow in a horse pond some times he refreshes himself in the trough of a town pump without caring what the people think about him often while carefully picking my way along the street after a heavy shower i have been scandalized to see monsieur du miroir in full dress paddling from one mud puddle to another and plunging into the filthy depths of each seldom have i peeped into a well without discerning this ridiculous gentleman at the bottom whence he gazes up as through a long telescopic tube and probably makes discoveries among the stars by daylight wandering along lonesome paths or in pathless forests when i have come to virgin fountains of which it would have been pleasant to deem myself the first discoverer i have started to find monsieur du miroir there before me the solitude seemed lonelier for his presence i have leaned from a precipice that frowns over lake george which the french call nature s font of sacramental water and used it in their log churches here and their cathedrals beyond the sea and seen him far below in that pure element at niagara too where i would gladly have forgotten both myself and him i could not help observing my companion in the smooth water on the very verge of the cataract just above the table rock were i to reach the sources of the nile i should expect to meet him there unless he be another ladurlad whose garments the depth of ocean could not moisten it is difficult to conceive how he keeps himself in any decent pickle though i am bound to confess that his clothes seem always as dry and comfortable as my own but as a friend i could wish that he would not so often expose himself in liquor all that i have hitherto related may be classed among those little personal oddities which agreeably diversify the surface of society and though they may sometimes annoy us yet keep our daily intercourse fresher and livelier than if they were done away by an occasional hint however i have endeavored to pave the way for stranger things to come which had they been disclosed at once monsieur du miroir might have been deemed a shadow and myself a person of no veracity and this truthful history a fabulous legend but now that the reader knows me worthy of his confidence i will begin to make him stare to speak frankly then i could bring the most astounding proofs that monsieur du miroir is at least a conjurer if not one of that unearthly tribe with whom

and happy like my little girl if venetia be like the spring mamma is like the summer replied the child and the mother smiled and is not the summer young and happy resumed venetia it is not quite so young as the spring said lady annabel looking down with fondness on her little companion and i fear not quite so happy but it is as beautiful said venetia it is not beauty that makes us happy said lady annabel to be happy my love we must be good am i good said venetia very good said lady annabel i am very happy said venetia i wonder whether if i be always good i shall always be happy you cannot

respectful distance leading miss herbert s donkey they soon entered a winding path through the wood which was the background of their dwelling lady annabel was silent and lost in her reflections venetia plucked the beautiful wild hyacinths that then abounded in the wood in such profusion that their beds spread like patches of blue enamel and gave them to mistress pauncefort who as the

emerged from the wood they found themselves on the brow of the hill a small down over which venetia ran exulting in the healthy breeze which at this exposed height was strong and fresh as they advanced to the opposite declivity to that which they had ascended a wide and peculiar landscape opened before them the extreme distance was formed by an undulating ridge of lofty and savage hills nearer than these were gentler elevations partially wooded and at their base was a rich valley its green meads fed by a clear and rapid stream which glittered in the sun as it coursed on losing itself at length in a wild and sedgy lake that formed the furthest limit of a widely spreading park in the centre of this park and not very remote from the banks of the rivulet was an ancient gothic building that had once been an abbey of great repute and wealth and had not much suffered in its external character by having served for nearly two centuries and a half as the principal dwelling of an old baronial family descending the downy hill that here and there was studded with fine old trees enriching by their presence the view from the abbey lady annabel and her party entered the meads and skirting the lake approached the venerable walls without crossing the stream it was difficult to conceive a scene more silent and more desolate there was no sign of life and not a sound save the occasional cawing of a rook advancing towards the abbey they passed a pile of buildings that in the summer might be screened from sight by the foliage of a group of elms too scanty at present to veil their desolation wide gaps in the roof proved that the vast and dreary stables were no longer used there were empty granaries whose doors had fallen from their hinges the gate of the courtyard was prostrate on the ground and the silent clock that once adorned the cupola over the noble entrance arch had long lost its index even the litter of the yard appeared dusty and grey with age you felt sure no human foot could have disturbed it for years at the back of these buildings were nailed the trophies of the gamekeeper hundreds of wild cats dried to blackness stretched their downward heads and legs from the mouldering wall hawks magpies and jays hung in tattered remnants but all grey and even green with age and the heads of birds in plenteous rows nailed beak upward and so dried and shrivelled by the suns and winds and frosts of many seasons that their distinctive characters were lost do you know my good pauncefort

becoming solicitor general at fifty and ceasing to hold that much desired office four months after his appointment such cessation however arising from political causes is no disappointment to a man it will doubtless be the case that a man so placed will regret the weakness of his party which has been unable to keep the good things of government in its hands but he will recognise without remorse or sorrow the fact that the ministry to which he has attached himself must cease to be a ministry and there will be nothing in his displacement to gall his pride or to create that inner feeling of almost insupportable mortification which comes from the conviction of personal failure sir thomas underwood had been solicitor general for a few months under a conservative prime minister and when the conservative minister went out of office sir thomas underwood followed him with no feeling of regret that caused him unhappiness but when afterwards the same party came back to power and he having lost his election at the borough which he had represented was passed over without a word of sympathy or even of assumed regret from the minister then he was wounded it was true he knew that a man to be solicitor general should have a seat in parliament the highest legal offices in the country are not to be attained by any amount of professional excellence unless the candidate shall have added to such excellence the power of supporting a ministry and a party in the house of commons sir thomas underwood thoroughly understood this but he knew also that there are various ways in which a lame dog may be helped over a stile if only the lame dog be popular among dogs for another ex solicitor general a seat would have been found or some delay would have been granted or at least there would have been a consultation with a suggestion that something should be tried but in this case a man four years his junior in age whom he despised and who as he was informed had obtained his place in parliament by gross bribery was put into the office without a word of apology to him then he was unhappy and acknowledged to himself that his spirit was crushed but he acknowledged to himself at the same time that he was one doomed by his nature to such crushing of the spirit if he came out of the hole of his solitude and endeavoured to carry on the open fight of life among his fellow men he knew that he was one doomed to that disappointment the bitterest of all which comes from failure when the prize has been all but reached it is much to have become solicitor general and that he had achieved but it is worse than nothing to have been solicitor general for four months and then to find that all the world around one regards one as having failed and as being therefore fit for the shelf such were sir thomas underwood s feelings as he sat alone in his chambers during those days in which the new administration was formed in which days he was neither consulted nor visited nor communicated with either by message or by letter but all this this formation of a ministry in which the late solicitor general was not invited to take a part occurred seven years before the commencement of our story during those years in which our lawyer sat in parliament as mr underwood at which time he was working hard also as a chancery barrister and was perhaps nearer to his fellow men than he had ever been before or was ever destined to be afterwards he resided as regarded himself almost nominally at a small but pretty villa which he had taken for his wife s sake at fulham it was close upon the river and had well arranged though not extensive shrubbery walks and a little lawn and a tiny conservatory and a charming opening down to the thames mrs underwood had found herself unable to live in half moon street and mr underwood not unwillingly had removed his household gods to this retreat at that time his household gods consisted of a wife and two daughters but the wife had died before the time came at which she could have taken on herself the name of lady underwood the villa at fulham was still kept and there lived the two girls and there also sir thomas had he been interrogated on the subject would have declared that he also was domiciled but if a man lives at the place in which he most often sleeps sir thomas in truth lived at his chambers at southampton buildings when he moved those household gods of his to the villa it was necessary because of his duties in parliament that he should have some place in town wherein he might lay his head and therefore i fear not unwillingly he took to laying his head very frequently in the little bedroom which was attached to his chambers it is not necessary that we should go back to any feelings which might have operated upon him during his wife s lifetime or during the period of his parliamentary career his wife was now dead and he no longer held a seat in parliament he had indeed all but abandoned his practice at the bar never putting himself forward for the ordinary business of a chancery barrister but nevertheless he spent the largest half of his life in his chambers breakfasting there reading there writing there and sleeping there he did not altogether desert the lodge at fulham and the two girls who lived there he would not even admit to them or allow them to assert that he had not his home with them sometimes for two nights together and sometimes for three he would be at the villa never remaining there however during the day but on sundays it may almost be said that he was never at home and hence arose the feeling that of all this went the nearest to create discord between the father and the daughters sir thomas was always in southampton buildings on sundays did sir thomas go to church the miss underwoods did

said mrs finn and windbags don t get college scholarships said matilda finn the second daughter but papa always snubs phinny said barbara the youngest i ll snub you if you don t take care said the doctor taking barbara tenderly by the ear for his youngest daughter was the doctor s pet the doctor certainly did not snub his son for he allowed him to go over to london when he was twenty two years of age in order that he might read with an english barrister it was the doctor s wish that his son might be called to the irish bar and the young man s desire that he might go to the english bar the doctor so far gave way under the influence of phineas himself and of all the young women of the family as to pay the usual fee to a very competent and learned gentleman in the middle temple and to allow his son one hundred and fifty pounds per annum for three years dr finn however was still firm in his intention that his son should settle in dublin and take the munster circuit believing that phineas might come to want home influences and home connections in spite of the swanhood which was attributed to him phineas sat his terms for three years and was duly called to the bar but no evidence came home as to the acquirement of any considerable amount of law lore or even as to much law study on the part of the young aspirant the learned pundit at whose feet he had been sitting was not especially loud in praise of his pupil s industry though he did say a pleasant word or two as to his pupil s intelligence phineas himself did not boast much of his own hard work when at home during the long vacation no rumours of expected successes of expected professional successes reached the ears of any of the finn family at killaloe but nevertheless there came tidings which maintained those high ideas in the maternal bosom of which mention has been made and which were of sufficient strength to induce the doctor in opposition to his own judgment to consent to the continued residence of his son in london phineas belonged to an excellent club the reform club and went into very good society he was hand in glove with the hon laurence fitzgibbon the youngest son of lord claddagh he was intimate with barrington erle who had been private secretary one of the private secretaries to the great whig prime minister who was lately in but was now out he had dined three or four times with that great whig nobleman the earl of brentford and he had been assured that if he stuck to the english bar he would certainly do well though he might fail to succeed in court or in chambers he would doubtless have given to him some one of those numerous appointments for which none but clever young barristers are supposed to be fitting candidates the old doctor yielded for another year although at the end of the second year he was called upon to pay a sum of three hundred pounds which was then due by phineas to creditors in london when the doctor s male friends in and about killaloe heard that he had done so they said that he was doting not one of the miss finns was as yet married and after all that had been said about the doctor s wealth it was supposed that there would not be above five hundred pounds a year among them all were he to give up his profession but the doctor when he paid that three hundred pounds for his son buckled to his work again though he had for twelve months talked of giving up the midwifery he buckled to again to the great disgust of dr duggin who at this time said very ill natured things about young phineas at the end of the three years phineas was called to the bar and immediately received a letter from his father asking minutely as to his professional intentions his father recommended him to settle in dublin and promised the one hundred and fifty pounds for three more years on condition that this advice was followed he did not absolutely say that the allowance would be stopped if the advice were not followed but that was plainly to be implied that letter came at the moment of a dissolution of parliament lord de terrier the conservative prime minister who had now been in office for the almost unprecedentedly long period of fifteen months had found that he could not face continued majorities against him in the house of commons and had dissolved the house rumour declared that he would have much preferred to resign and betake himself once again to the easy glories of opposition but his party had naturally been obdurate with him and he had resolved to appeal to the country when phineas received his father s letter it had just been suggested to him at the reform club that he should stand for the irish borough of loughshane this proposition had taken phineas finn so much by surprise that when first made to him by barrington erle it took his breath away what he stand for parliament twenty four years old with no vestige of property belonging to him without a penny in his purse as completely dependent on his father as he was when he first went to school at eleven years of age and for loughshane a little borough in the county galway for which a brother of that fine old irish peer the earl of tulla had been sitting for the last twenty years a fine high minded representative of the thorough going orange protestant feeling of ireland and the earl of tulla to whom almost all loughshane belonged or at any

latter sparingly but they will not have imbued her with that hope for some transcendental paradise of affection which so often fills and exalts the hearts of our daughters here at home she is moderate in her aspirations requiring less excitement than an english girl and never forgetting the solid necessities of life as they are so often forgotten here in england in associating with young men an english girl will always remember that in each one she so meets she may find an admirer whom she may possibly love or an admirer whom she may probably be called on to repel she is ever conscious of the fact of this position and a romance is thus engendered which if it may at times be dangerous is at any rate always charming but the german girl in her simplicity has no such consciousness as you and i my reader might probably become dear friends were we to meet and know each other so may the german girl learn to love the fair haired youth with whom chance has for a time associated her but to her mind there occurs no suggestive reason why it should be so no probability that the youth may regard her in such light because that chance has come to pass she can therefore give him her hand without trepidation and talk with him for half an hour when called on to do so as calmly as she might do with his sister such a one was isa heine at the time of which i am writing we english in our passion for daily excitement might call her phlegmatic but we should call her so unjustly life to her was a serious matter of which the daily duties and daily wants were sufficient to occupy her thoughts she was her mother s companion the instructress of both her brother and her sister and the charm of her father s vacant hours with such calls upon her time and so many realities around her her imagination did not teach her to look for joys beyond those of her present life and home when love and marriage should come to her as come they probably might she would endeavour to attune herself to a new happiness and a new sphere of duties in the meantime she was contented to keep her mother s accounts and look after her brother and sister up two pair of stairs in the ludwigs strasse but change would certainly come we may prophesy for isa heine was a beautiful girl tall and graceful comely to the eye and fit in every way to be loved and cherished as the partner of a man s home i have said that an english clerk made a part of that small establishment in the dingy banking office in the schrannen platz and i must say a word or two of herbert onslow in his early career he had not been fortunate his father with means sufficiently moderate and with a family more than sufficiently large had sent him to a public school at which he had been very idle and then to one of the universities at which he had run into debt and had therefore left without a degree when this occurred a family council of war had been held among the onslows and it was decided that herbert should be sent off to the banking house of heines at munich there being a cousinship between the families and some existing connections of business it was therefore so settled and herbert willing enough to see the world as he considered he should do by going to munich started for his german home with injunctions very tender from his mother and very solemn from his aggrieved father but there was nothing bad at the heart about young onslow and if the solemn father had well considered it he might perhaps have felt that those debts at cambridge reflected more fault on him than on his son when herbert arrived at munich his cousins the heines far away cousins though they were behaved kindly to him they established him at first in lodgings where he was boarded with many others having heard somewhat of his early youth but when madame heine at the end of twelve months perceived that he was punctual at the bank and that his allowances which though moderate in england were handsome in munich carried him on without debt she opened her motherly arms and suggested to his mother and to himself that he should live with them in this way he also was domiciled up two pairs of stairs in the palatial residence in the ludwigs strasse but all this happened long ago isa heine had been only seventeen when her cousin had first come to munich and had made acquaintance with him rather as a child than as a woman and when as she ripened into womanhood this young man came more closely among them it did not strike her that the change would affect her more powerfully than it would the others her uncle and father she knew had approved of herbert at the bank and herbert had shown that he could be steady therefore he was to be taken into their family paying his annual subsidy instead of being left with strangers at the boarding house all this was very simple to her she assisted in mending his linen as she did her father s she visited his room daily as she visited all the others she took notice of his likings and dislikings as touching their table arrangement but by no means such notice as she did of her father s and without any flutter inwardly in her imagination or outwardly as regarded the world she made him one of the family so things went on for a year nay so things went on for two years with her after herbert onslow had come to the ludwigs strasse but the matter had been regarded in a very different light by herbert himself when the proposition had been made to him his first idea had been that so close a connection with a girl so very pretty would be delightful he had blushed as he had given in his adhesion but madame heine when she saw the blush had attributed it to anything but the true cause when isa had asked him as to his wants

which it is found for the darwinian an organism exists because out of many of its kind it is the only one which has been able to persist in the conditions in which it is found teleology implies that the organs of every organism are perfect and cannot be improved the darwinian theory simply affirms that they work well enough to enable the organism to hold its own against such competitors as it has met with but admits the possibility of indefinite improvement but an example may bring into clearer light the profound opposition between the ordinary teleological and the darwinian conception cats catch mice small birds and the like very well teleology tells us that they do so because they were expressly constructed for so doing that they are perfect mousing apparatuses so perfect and so delicately adjusted that no one of their organs could be altered without the change involving the alteration of all the rest darwinism affirms on the contrary that there was no express construction concerned in the matter but that among the multitudinous variations of the feline stock many of which died out from want of power to resist opposing influences some the cats were better fitted to catch mice than others whence they throve and persisted in proportion to the advantage over their fellows thus offered to them far from imagining that cats exist in order to catch mice well darwinism supposes that cats exist because they catch mice well mousing being not the end but the condition of their existence and if the cat type has long persisted as we know it the interpretation of the fact upon darwinian principles would be not that the cats have remained invariable but that such varieties as have incessantly occurred have been on the whole less fitted to get on in the world than the existing stock if we apprehend the spirit of the origin of species rightly then nothing can be more entirely and absolutely opposed to teleology as it is commonly understood than the darwinian theory so far from being a teleologist in the fullest sense of the word we would deny that he is a teleologist in the ordinary sense at all and we should say that apart from his merits as a naturalist he has rendered a most remarkable service to philosophical thought by enabling the student of nature to recognise to their fullest extent those adaptations to purpose which are so striking in the organic world and which teleology has done good service in keeping before our minds without being false to the fundamental principles of a scientific conception of the universe the apparently diverging teachings of the teleologist and of the morphologist are reconciled by the darwinian hypothesis but leaving our own impressions of the origin of species and turning to those passages especially cited by professor kolliker we cannot admit that they bear the interpretation he puts upon them darwin if we read him rightly does not affirm that every detail in the structure of an animal has been created for its benefit his words are p the foregoing remarks lead me to say a few words on the protest lately made by some naturalists against the utilitarian doctrine that every detail of structure has been produced for the good of its possessor they believe that very many structures have been created for beauty in the eyes of man or for mere variety this doctrine if true would be absolutely fatal to my theory yet i fully admit that many structures are of no direct use to their possessor and after sundry illustrations and qualifications he concludes p hence every detail of structure in every living creature making some little allowance for the direct action of physical conditions may be viewed either as having been of special use to some ancestral form or as being now of special use to the descendants of this form either directly or indirectly through the complex laws of growth but it is one thing to say darwinically that every detail observed in an animal s structure is of use to it or has been of use to its ancestors and quite another to affirm teleologically that every detail of an animal s structure has been created for its benefit on the former hypothesis for example the teeth of the foetal balaena have a meaning on the latter none so far as we are aware there is not a phrase in the origin of species inconsistent with professor kolliker s position that varieties arise irrespectively of the notion of purpose or of utility according to general laws of nature and may be either useful or hurtful or indifferent on the contrary mr darwin writes summary of chap v our ignorance of the laws of variation is profound not in one case out of a hundred can we pretend to assign any reason why this or that part varies more or less from the same part in the parents the external conditions of life as climate and food etc seem to have induced some slight modifications habit in producing constitutional differences and use in strengthening and disuse in weakening and diminishing organs seem to have been more potent in their effects and finally as if to prevent all possible misconception mr darwin concludes his chapter on variation with these pregnant words whatever the cause may be of each slight difference in the offspring from their parents and a cause for each must exist it is the steady accumulation through natural selection of such differences when beneficial to the individual that gives rise to all the more important modifications of structure which the innumerable beings on the face of the earth are enabled to struggle with each other and the best adapted to survive we have dwelt at length upon this subject because of its great general importance and because we believe that professor kolliker s criticisms on this he

of mercantile transactions in savage lands mariano drank in all that they said with youthful avidity and the little old lady s mouth rippled responsive like the aspen leaf to the breeze while lucien and juliet thus left to themselves had no other resource than to entertain each other as best they could then the adieux were said the voyagers went down to the port embarked on board their good ship a trim built schooner and set sail with a fair wind i wish i saw them all safe back again said the little old lady with a sigh juliet said nothing though she echoed the sigh meanwhile the schooner leant over to the breeze and ere night fall left the shores of sicily far behind chapter two unfolds a little of the tale another and a very different vessel chanced to be floating in those seas at the time the sicilian trader set sail at a distance she might have been mistaken for a fishing boat for she carried only two lateen sails of that high triangular form which may still be seen in the mediterranean and on the lakes of switzerland in reality however the vessel was of greater dimensions than even the largest boat and her main mast with its sail was of gigantic proportions she was also full decked and several pieces of heavy ordnance pointed their black muzzles from port holes in her bulwarks no one could have mistaken her character as a vessel of war for besides the guns referred to she had an unusually large crew of bronzed and stalwart men their costume as well as their arms told that these were of eastern origin although there was much variety in detail they all wore the same gold laced jackets the same loose turkish drawers gathered in below the knees and broad silken scarfs round their waists with richly chased silver mounted pistols and yataghans or curved swords some wore the turban others the blue tasselled red fez or tarbouch of tunis while a few contented themselves with a kerchief tied loosely round their heads one who appeared to be the captain of the vessel stood near the steersman leaning on the bulwarks and scanning the horizon with a telescope his costume was similar to that of his men but of richer material it is certainly a sail said he whom we have styled the captain to one who stood by his side and might have been his lieutenant or mate she bears sou west i think replied the latter so much the better returned the captain let her fall off a little so steady if this wind holds for half an hour we shall get well abreast of her and then the captain shut up the telescope with an emphatic bang by way of termination to his remark and turning on his heel paced the deck rapidly by the side of his mate we have been unlucky hitherto he observed perchance fortune may change and now be favourable at all events we shall be ready see the breeze freshens go call up the men and clear for action the breeze had indeed been freshening while he spoke and now came down in a series of squalls that caused the piratical looking craft to lie over as if she were about to capsize the vessel which they were pursuing also bent over to the breeze and crowded all sail for well did francisco its owner and padrone know from past experience that algerine corsairs were fast sailers and that his only hope lay in showing them his heels he had often given them the slip before why should he not again while thus doing his best to escape however the bluff merchant did not neglect to make preparations for defence clear away the big gun he said to mariano who acted as his first officer lucien being the scrivano or supercargo of the vessel tis a good piece and has turned the flight of many a pirate with its first bark the latter part of this remark was addressed to bacri who stood leaning over the taffrail looking anxiously at the vessel in chase if it be sidi hassan muttered the jew half aloud there is little chance what say you demanded francisco i say that if it be the vessel of a man whom i happen to know you will have to trust to your sails for deliverance fighting will be of no avail francisco looked at the jew with some surprise not unmingled with contempt a warlike spirit it seems does not always consort with a powerful frame he said but how come you to have scraped acquaintance with these pirates whose existence is a blight upon the commerce of the mediterranean and a disgrace to our age none should know better than thyself that a trader like any other traveller becomes acquainted with strange bedfellows replied bacri with a quiet smile as to a warlike spirit of what use would it be in a despised israelite to display such there is truth in that returned the padrone in a more respectful tone nevertheless if fighting becomes needful i trust that one furnished with such thews and sinews will not fail to lend effective aid that he will not i dare say and here is a cutlass for him wherewith

peering out of the narrow windows of the stately old brick house nay the acute observer might have recognized the little red nose of good natured miss jemima pinkerton herself rising over some

amusements of the charms of ladies society he had known but little very many of the estates around him had been absolutely abandoned as was the case with his own coffee plantation and from others men had sent away their wives and daughters nay most of the proprietors had gone themselves leaving an overseer to extract what little might yet be extracted out of the property it too often happened that that little was not sufficient to meet the demands of the overseer himself the house at mount pleasant had been an irregular low roofed picturesque residence built with only one floor and surrounded on all sides by large verandahs in the old days it had always been kept in perfect order but now this was far from being the case few young bachelors can keep a house in order but no bachelor young or old can do so under such a doom as that of maurice cumming every shilling that maurice cumming could collect was spent in bribing negroes to work for him but bribe as he would the negroes would not work no massa me pain here me no workee to day and sambo would lay his fat hand on his fat stomach i have said that he lived generally alone occasionally his house on mount pleasant was enlivened by visits of an aunt a maiden sister of his mother whose usual residence was at spanish town it is or should be known to all men that spanish town was and is the seat of jamaica legislature but maurice was not over fond of his relative in this he was both wrong and foolish for miss sarah jack such was her name was in many respects a good woman and was certainly a rich woman it is true that she was not a handsome woman nor a fashionable woman nor perhaps altogether an agreeable woman she was tall thin ungainly and yellow her voice which she used freely was harsh she was a politician and a patriot she regarded england as the greatest of countries and jamaica as the greatest of colonies but much as she loved england she was very loud in denouncing what she called the perfidy of the mother to the brightest of her children and much as she loved jamaica she was equally severe in her taunts against those of her brother islanders who would not believe that the island might yet flourish as it had flourished in her father s days it is because you and men like you will not do your duty by your country she had said some score of times to maurice not with much justice considering the laboriousness of his life but maurice knew well what she meant what could i do there up at spanish town he would answer among such a pack as there are there here i may do something and then she would reply with the full swing of her eloquence it is because you and such as you think only of yourself and not of jamaica that jamaica has come to such a pass as this why is there a pack there as you call them in the honourable house of assembly why are not the best men in the island to be found there as the best men in england are to be found in the british house of commons a pack indeed my father was proud of a seat in that house and i remember the day maurice cumming when your father also thought it no shame to represent his own parish if men like you who have a stake in the country will not go there of course the house is filled with men who have no stake if they are a pack it is you who send them there you and others like you all had its effect though at the moment maurice would shrug his shoulders and turn away his head from the torrent of the lady s discourse but miss jack though she was not greatly liked was greatly respected maurice would not own that she convinced him but at last he did allow his name to be put up as candidate for his own parish and in due time he became a member of the honourable house of assembly in jamaica this honour entails on the holder of it the necessity of living at or within reach of spanish town for some ten weeks towards the chose of every year now on the whole face of the uninhabited globe there is perhaps no spot more dull to look at more lethean in its aspect more corpse like or more cadaverous than spanish town it is the head quarters of the government the seat of the legislature the residence of the governor but nevertheless it is as it were a city of the very dead here as we have said before lived miss jack in a large forlorn ghost like house in which her father and all her family had lived before her and as a matter of course maurice cumming when he came up to attend to his duties as a member of the legislature took up his abode with her now at the time of which we are specially speaking he had completed the first of these annual visits he had already benefited his country by sitting out one session of the colonial parliament and had satisfied himself that he did no other good than that of keeping away some person more objectionable than himself he was however prepared to repeat this self sacrifice in a spirit of patriotism for which he received a very meagre meed of eulogy from miss jack and an amount of self applause which was not much more extensive down at mount pleasant i can do something he would say over and over again but what good can any man do up here you can do your duty miss jack would answer as others did before you when the colony was made to prosper and then they would run off into a long discussion about free labour and protective duties but at the present moment maurice cumming had another vexation on his mind over and above that arising from his wasted hours at spanish town and his fruitless labours at mount pleasant he was in love and was not altogether satisfied with the conduct of his lady love miss jack had other nephews besides maurice cumming and nieces also of whom marian leslie was one

leading across the river from side to side the town is filled with magnificent churches and palaces built some of them a thousand years ago and all so richly adorned with sculptures paintings bronzes and mosaics that the whole world flock there to see them people go there chiefly in the winter at that season the town is crowded with strangers a great many people too go there in the winter to avoid the cold weather which prevails at that time of the year in all the more northerly countries of europe there is so little winter in florence that few of the houses have any fireplaces in them except in the kitchen when there comes a cold day the people warm themselves by means of a jug or jar of earthen ware with a handle passing over across the top by which they carry it about they fill these jars half full of hot embers and so carry them with them wherever they want to go the women when they sit down put the jar under their dresses on the floor or pavement beneath them and the men place it right before them between their feet you will see market women and flower girls sitting in the corners of the streets in the winter attending to their business and keeping themselves warm all the time with these little fire jars and artists in the palaces and picture galleries each with one of them by his side or close before him while he is at work copying the works of the great masters or making drawings from the antique statues there is another very curious use that the people of florence make of these jars and that is they warm the beds with them when any body is sick so as to require this indulgence you would think it very difficult to warm a bed with an open jar filled with burning embers the way they do it is this they hang the jar in the inside of a sort of wooden cage shaped like a bushel basket and about as large they turn this cage upside down and hang the jar up in it by means of a hook depending inside they turn down the bed clothes and put the cage in it jar of coals and all they then put back the bed clothes and cover the cage all up they leave it so for a quarter of an hour and then carefully turning the clothes down again they take the jar out and the bed is warmed but to return to mr george and rollo they engaged a vetturino for the first time at florence mr george had gone to florence chiefly for the purpose of examining the immense collections of paintings and statuary which exist there rollo went not on account of the paintings or statues for he did not care much about such things but because he liked to go any where where he could see new places and be entertained by new scenes accordingly while mr george was at work in the galleries of florence studying by the help of catalogues the famous specimens of ancient art rollo was usually rambling about the streets observing the manners and customs of the people and watching the singular and curious scenes that every where met his eye the reason why there are so many paintings and sculptures in italy is this in the middle ages it was the fashion in all the central parts of europe for the people to spend almost all their surplus money in building and decorating churches indeed there was then very little else that they could do at the present time people invest their funds as fast as they accumulate them in building ships and railroads docks for the storage of merchandise houses and stores in cities to let for the sake of the rent and country seats or pretty private residences of various kinds for themselves but in the middle ages very little could be done in the way of investments like these there were no railroads and there was very little use for ships there was no profit to be gained by building houses and stores for there were so many wars and commotions among the people of the different towns and kingdoms that nothing was stable or safe for the same reason it was useless for men to spend their money in building and ornamenting their own houses for at the first approach of an enemy the town in which they lived was likely to be sacked and their houses and all the fine furniture which they might contain would be burned or destroyed but the churches were safe the people of the different countries had so much veneration for sacred places and for every thing connected with religion that they were afraid to touch or injure any thing that had been consecrated to a religious use to plunder a church or a convent or an abbey or to do any thing to injure or destroy the property that they contained was regarded as sacrilege and sacrilege they deemed a dreadful crime abhorred by god and man thus while they would burn and destroy hundreds of dwellings without any remorse and turn the wretched inmates out at midnight into the streets to die of exposure terror and despair they would stop at once when they came to the church afraid to harm it in any way or to touch the least thing that it contained accordingly while every thing else in a conquered town was doomed to the most reckless destruction all that was in the church the most delicate paintings and the most costly gold and silver images and utensils were as safe as if they were surrounded by impregnable castle walls of course these notions were very mistaken ones according to the teachings of our lord and saviour jesus christ it must be a greater sin to burn down the cottage of a poor widow and turn her out at midnight into the streets to die than to plunder for gain the richest altar in the world from these and various other similar causes it happened that in the middle ages that is from five hundred to a thousand years ago almost all the great expenditures of money in all the great cities and towns of europe were made for churches sometimes these churches were so

a number of seamen were congregated holding on under the lee of the parapet wall and gazing anxiously at the fearful scene outside impossible said one no boat could live in such a sea for half a minute the moment she shows her nose outside the breakwater she ll capsize observed another we ll have to risk it anyhow remarked a stout young fellow for i see men in the foreshrouds of the wreck and i for one won t stand by and see them lost while we ve got a lifeboat by us why wot s the use o callin it a lifeboat if it can t do more than other boats as he spoke there came an unusually furious gust which sent a wave right over the pier and well nigh swept away one or two of them the argument of the storm was more powerful than that of the young sailor no one responded to his appeal and when the boat came alongside the stairs none moved to enter her except himself that s right bob gaston cried one of the four men who had jumped into the boat when she was launched i know d you would be the first and i won t be the last either said young gaston looking back at the men on the pier with a smile right lad cried captain boyns who came up at the instant and leaped into the boat come lads we want four more hands no no harry he added pushing back his son your arms are not yet strong enough come lads we ve no time to lose as he spoke a faint cry was heard coming from the wreck and it was seen that one of the masts had gone by the board carrying it was feared several poor fellows along with it instantly there was a rush to the lifeboat all thought of personal danger appeared to have been banished from the minds of the fishermen when the cry of distress broke on their ears the boat was overmanned and old jacobs the coxswain had to order several of them to go ashore again in another minute they were at the mouth of the harbour and the men paused an instant as if to gather strength for the mortal struggle before quitting the shelter of the breakwater and facing the fury of wind and waves give way lads give way shouted old jacobs as he stood up in the stern sheets and grasped the steering oar the men bent to the oars with all their might and the boat leaped out into the boiling sea this was not one of those splendid boats which now line the shores of the united kingdom nevertheless it was a noble craft one of the good stable insubmergible and self emptying kind which were known as the greathead lifeboats and which for many years did good service on our coasts it sat on the raging waters like a swan and although the seas broke over it again and again it rose out of the water buoyantly and with the brine pouring from its sides kept end on to the seas surmounting them or dashing right through them while her gallant crew strained every muscle and slowly urged her on towards the wreck at first the men on shore gazed at her in breathless anxiety expecting every moment to see her overturned and their comrades left to perish in the waves but when they saw her reappear from each overwhelming billow their hearts rose with a rebound and loud prolonged huzzas cheered the lifeboat on her course they became silent again however when distance and the intervening haze of spray and rain rendered her motions indistinct and their feelings of anxiety became more and more intense as they saw her draw nearer and nearer to the wreck at last they reached it but no one on the pier could tell with what success their efforts were attended through the blinding spray they saw her faintly now rising on the crest of a huge wave then overwhelmed by tons of water at last she appeared to get close under the stern of the brig and was lost to view they re all gone said a fisherman on the pier as he wiped the salt water off his face i know d that no boat that ever wos built could live in that sea ye don t know much yet bill bout anything a most replied an old man near him why i ve see d boats in the east not much better than two planks as could go through a worse surf than that may be so retorted bill but i know hallo is that her coming off that s her cried several voices all right my hearties not so sure o that observed another of the excited band of men who watched every motion of the little craft intently there why i do believe there are more in her now than went out in her what think ee dick dick did not reply for by that time the boat having got clear of the wreck was making for the shore and the observers were all too intent in using their eyes to make use of their tongues coming as she did before the wind the progress of the lifeboat was very different from what it had been when she set out in a few minutes she became distinctly visible careering on the crest of the waves towards the harbour mouth and then it was ascertained beyond doubt that some at least if not all of the crew of the brig had been rescued a short sharp hurrah burst from the men on the outlook when this became certain but they relapsed into deep silence again for the return of the boat was more critical than its departure had been there is much more danger in running before a heavy sea than in pulling against it every roaring billow that came into the bay near the cove like a green wall broke in thunder on the sands before reaching the wreck and as it continued its furious career towards the beach it seemed to gather fresh strength so that the steersman of the lifeboat had to keep her stern carefully towards it to prevent her from turning broadside on or as it is nautically expressed broaching to had she done so the death of all on board would have been almost inevitable knowing this the men on the pier gazed with breathless anxiety as

chinese protection of american ships against such outrages art the united states of america and his majesty the emperor of china believing that the safety and prosperity of commerce will thereby best be promoted agree that any privilege or immunity in respect to trade or navigation within the chinese dominions which may not have been stipulated for by treaty shall be subject to the discretion of the chinese government and may be regulated by it accordingly but not in a manner or spirit incompatible with the treaty stipulations of the parties at a first glance this clause would seem unnecessary unnecessary because the granting of any privilege not stipulated in a treaty with china must of course be a matter entirely subject to the pleasure of the chinese government yet the clause has its significance there is in china a class of foreigners who demand privileges concessions and immunities instead of asking for them a class who look upon the chinese as degraded barbarians and not entitled to charity as helpless and therefore to be trodden underfoot a tyrannical class who say openly that the chinese should be forced to do thus and so that foreigners know what is best for them better than they do themselves and therefore it would be but a christian kindness to take them by the throat and compel them to see their real interests as the enlightened foreigners see them these people harass and distress the government by constantly dictating to it and meddling with its affairs they beget and keep alive a distrust of foreigners among the chinese people it will surprise many among us to know that the chinese are eminently hospitable by nature toward strangers it will surprise many whose notion of chinamen is that they are a race who formerly manifested their interest in shipwrecked strangers by exhibiting them in iron cages in public in a half starved condition as rare and curious monsters to know that a few hundred years ago they welcomed adventurous jesuit priests who struggled to their shores with great cordiality and gave to them the fullest liberty in the dissemination of their doctrines i have seen at st peter s in rome a picture of certain restive chinamen barbecuing some romish priests this was an uncalled for stretch of hospitality if it be proposed to call it hospitality at all but the caging and barbecuing of strangers were disagreeable attentions which were secured to those strangers by their predecessors as i have said the chinese were exceedingly hospitable and kind toward the first foreigners who came among them or years ago they listened to their preachings they joined their church they saw the doctrines of christianity spreading far and wide over the land yet nobody murmured against these things the jesuit priests were elevated to high offices in the government china s confidence in the foreigners was not betrayed in time had the jesuits been let alone they would have completely christianized china no doubt that is they would have made of the chinese christians according to their moral physical and intellectual strength and then given nature a few generations in which to shed the pagan skin and sap the pagan blood and so perfect the work for be it known one jesuit missionary is equal to an army of any other denomination where there is actual work to be done and solid unsentimental wisdom to be exercised however to pursue my narrative some priests of the dominican order arrived and very shortly began to make trouble they began to cramp the privileges of converts they flouted the system of persuasion of the jesuits and adopted that of driving they meddled in politics they became arrogant and dictatorial they fomented discords everywhere in a word they utterly destroyed chinese confidence in foreigners and raised up chinese hatred and distrust against them for these things they were driven out of the country when strangers came after that the chinese with that calm wisdom which comes only through bitter experience caged them or hanged them i spoke a while ago of a domineering hectoring class of foreigners in china who are always interfering with the government s business and thus keeping alive the distrust and dislike engendered by their kindred spirits the dominicans an age ago they clog progress article of the treaty is intended to discountenance all officious intermeddling with the government s business by americans and so move a step toward the restoration of that chinese confidence in strangers which was annihilated so long ago art the emperor of china shall have the right to appoint consuls at ports of the united states who shall enjoy the same privileges and immunities as those which are enjoyed by public law and treaty in the united states by the consuls of great britain and russia or either of them and soon perhaps within a year or two there will doubtless be a chinese envoy located permanently at washington the consuls referred to above will be appointed with all convenient dispatch they will be americans but will in all cases be men who are capable of feeling pity for persecuted chinamen and will call to a strict account all who wrong them it affords me infinite satisfaction to call particular attention to this consul clause and think of the howl that will go up from the cooks the railroad graders and the cobble stone artists of california when they read it they can never beat and bang and set the dogs on the chinamen any more these pastimes are lost to them forever in san francisco a large part of the most interesting local

that she was faded and thin to excite his esteem he had never indulged much hope he had now none of ever reading her name in any other page of his favourite work all equality of alliance must rest with elizabeth for mary had merely connected herself with an old country family of respectability and large fortune and had therefore given all the honour and received none elizabeth would one day or other marry suitably it sometimes happens that a woman is handsomer at twenty nine than she was ten years before and generally speaking if there has been neither ill health nor anxiety it is a time of life at which scarcely any charm is lost it was so with elizabeth still the same handsome miss elliot that she had begun to be thirteen years ago and sir walter might be excused therefore in forgetting her age or at least be deemed only half a fool for thinking himself and elizabeth as blooming as ever amidst the wreck of the good looks of everybody else for he could plainly see how old all the rest of his family and acquaintance were growing anne haggard mary coarse every face in the neighbourhood worsting and the rapid increase of the crow s foot about lady russell s temples had long been a distress to him elizabeth did not quite equal her father in personal contentment thirteen years had seen her mistress of kellynch hall presiding and directing with a self possession and decision which could never have given the idea of her being younger than she was for thirteen years had she been doing the honours and laying down the domestic law at home and leading the way to the chaise and four and walking immediately after lady russell out of all the drawing rooms and dining rooms in the country thirteen winters revolving frosts had seen her opening every ball of credit which a scanty neighbourhood afforded and thirteen springs shewn their blossoms as she travelled up to london with her father for a few weeks annual enjoyment of the great world she had the remembrance of all this she had the consciousness of being nine and twenty to give her some regrets and some apprehensions she was fully satisfied of being still quite as handsome as ever but she felt her approach to the years of danger and would have rejoiced to be certain of being properly solicited by baronet blood within the next twelvemonth or two then might she again take up the book of books with as much enjoyment as in her early youth but now she liked it not always to be presented with the date of her own birth and see no marriage follow but that of a youngest sister made the book an evil and more than once when her father had left it open on the table near her had she closed it with averted eyes and pushed it away she had had a disappointment moreover which that book and especially the history of her own family must ever present the remembrance of the heir presumptive the very william walter elliot esq whose rights had been so generously supported by her father had disappointed her she had while a very young girl as soon as she had known him to be in the event of her having no brother the future baronet meant to marry him and her father had always meant that she should he had not been known to them as a boy but soon after lady elliot s death sir walter had sought the acquaintance and though his overtures had not been met with any warmth he had persevered in seeking it making allowance for the modest drawing back of youth and in one of their spring excursions to london when elizabeth was in her first bloom mr elliot had been forced into the introduction he was at that time a very young man just engaged in the study of the law and elizabeth found him extremely agreeable and every plan in his favour was confirmed he was invited to kellynch hall he was talked of and expected all the rest of the year but he never came the following spring he was seen again in town found equally agreeable again encouraged invited and expected and again he did not come and the next tidings were that he was married instead of pushing his fortune in the line marked out for the heir of the house of elliot he had purchased independence by uniting himself to a rich woman of inferior birth sir walter has resented it as the head of the house he felt that he ought to have been consulted especially after taking the young man so publicly by the hand for they must have been seen together he observed once at tattersall s and twice in the lobby of the house of commons his disapprobation was expressed but apparently very little regarded mr elliot had attempted no apology and shewn himself as unsolicitous of being longer noticed by the family as sir walter considered him unworthy of it all acquaintance between them had ceased this very awkward history of mr elliot was still after an interval of several years felt with anger by elizabeth who had liked the man for himself and still more for being her father s heir and whose strong family pride could see only in him a proper match for sir walter elliot s eldest daughter there was not a baronet from a to z whom her feelings could have so willingly acknowledged as an equal yet so miserably had he conducted himself that though she was at this present time the summer of wearing black ribbons for his wife she could not admit him to be worth thinking of again the disgrace of his first marriage might perhaps as there was no reason to suppose it perpetuated by offspring have been got over had he not done worse but he had as by the accustomary intervention of kind friends they had been informed spoken most

subject of distaste at best more likely revulsion to the vast majority of the reading public perhaps the nature of the novel itself led him to consider publishing it anonymously although we know he was not averse to controversial subjects in his first book the macdermots of ballycloran which he thought had the best plot of all his novels the principal female character is seduced by a scoundrel and dies giving birth to an illegitimate child certainly nina was well suited for the experiment because of it s different setting and subject matter perhaps further to disguise his authorship trollope wrote nina in a style of prose that reads almost like a translation from a foreign language the experiment did not last long enough to test trollope s hypothesis mr hutton critic for the spectator recognized trollope as the author and so stated in his review trollope did not deny the accusation one cannot discuss nina balatka without addressing the question was trollope himself anti semitic a careful reading of his works does not provide a clear answer jews appear in some of his books and are referred to in others often as disreputable characters or money lenders they are seldom mentioned by his christian characters with respect probably realistically reflecting the sentiments of the classes he wrote about some of his greatest villains in his later novels melmotte in the way we live now and lopez in the prime minister are rumored to be jewish but trollope never unequivocally identifies them as jewish perhaps his christian characters expect them to be jewish because they are foreigners and villains however if one ignores the dialogue of his characters even the descriptive and editorial comments by trollope himself at first seem anti semitic he consistently uses jew as a pejorative adjective instead of jewish his descriptions of the appearance of jewish characters are usually unflattering and stereotypical even anton trendellsohn the hero of nina balatka is described as follows to those who know the outward types of his race there could be no doubt that anton trendellsohn was a very jew among jews he was certainly a handsome man not now very young having reached some year certainly in advance of thirty and his face was full of intellect he was slightly made below the middle height but was well made in every limb with small feet and hands and small ears and a well turned neck he was very dark dark as a man can be and yet show no sign of colour in his blood no white man could be more dark and swarthy than anton trendellsohn his eyes however which were quite black were very bright his jet black hair as it clustered round his ears had in it something of a curl had it been allowed to grow it would almost have hung in ringlets but it was worn very short as though its owner were jealous even of the curl anton trendellsohn was decidedly a handsome man but his eyes were somewhat too close together in his face and the bridge of his aquiline nose was not sharply cut as is mostly the case with such a nose on a christian face the olive oval face was without doubt the face of a jew and the mouth was greedy and the teeth were perfect and bright and the movement of the man s body was the movement of a jew this is not the typical description of the romantic hero of a victorian novel even so trollope s description of anton is less derogatory than his description of ezekiel brehgert a character in a later novel the way we live now he was a fat greasy man good looking in a certain degree about fifty with hair dyed black and beard and moustache dyed a dark purple colour the charm of his face consisted in a pair of very bright black eyes which were however set too near together in his face for the general delight of christians he was stout fat all over rather than corpulent and had that look of command in his face which has become common to master butchers probably by long intercourse with sheep and oxen the case for trollope being anti semitic is harder to support however when one considers the behavior of his jewish characters brehgert whose physical description above is stereotypic is one of the few characters in the way we live now whose actions are completely honorable trollope wrote novels before nina balatka only two of those contain jewish characters the first who plays a minor role in orley farm is soloman aram an attorney a victorian rumpole known for defending the accused at the old bailey his skill is needed to defend lady mason against a charge of perjury much to the distaste of her christian advisors he acts with dignity and shows great consideration for the personal comfort of lady mason during her trial the second jewish character in trollope s novels was mr hart a london tailor who runs for a seat in parliament in rachel ray this served no purpose in the plot the situation probably was included because legislation to allow jews to serve in parliament had been passed only five years before and the issue was still one of public discussion mr hart s appearance is brief he speaks only one or two lines and the reader is not told enough about him to judge his character trollope describes him thus and then the jewish hero the tailor himself came among them and astonished their minds by the ease and volubility of his speeches he did not pronounce his words with any of those soft slushy judaic utterances by which they had been taught to believe he would disgrace himself his nose was not hookey with any especial hook nor was it thicker at the

confusions falsehoods and absurdities covering the whole field of life a thing that fills us with astonishment almost if it were possible with incredulity for truly it is not easy to understand that sane men could ever calmly with their eyes open believe and live by such a set of doctrines that men should have worshipped their poor fellow man as a god and not him only but stocks and stones and all manner of animate and inanimate objects and fashioned for themselves such a distracted chaos of hallucinations by way of theory of the universe all this looks like an incredible fable nevertheless it is a clear fact that they did it such hideous inextricable jungle of misworships misbeliefs men made as we are did actually hold by and live at home in this is strange yes we may pause in sorrow and silence over the depths of darkness that are in man if we rejoice in the heights of purer vision he has attained to such things were and are in man in all men in us too some speculators have a short way of accounting for the pagan religion mere quackery priestcraft and dupery say they no sane man ever did believe it merely contrived to persuade other men not worthy of the name of sane to believe it it will be often our duty to protest against this sort of hypothesis about men s doings and history and i here on the very threshold protest against it in reference to paganism and to all other isms by which man has ever for a length of time striven to walk in this world they have all had a truth in them or men would not have taken them up quackery and dupery do abound in religions above all in the more advanced decaying stages of religions they have fearfully abounded but quackery was never the originating influence in such things it was not the health and life of such things but their disease the sure precursor of their being about to die let us never forget this it seems to me a most mournful hypothesis that of quackery giving birth to any faith even in savage men quackery gives birth to nothing gives death to all things we shall not see into the true heart of anything if we look merely at the quackeries of it if we do not reject the quackeries altogether as mere diseases corruptions with which our and all men s sole duty is to have done with them to sweep them out of our thoughts as out of our practice man everywhere is the born enemy of lies i find grand lamaism itself to have a kind of truth in it read the candid clear sighted rather sceptical mr turner s account of his embassy to that country and see they have their belief these poor thibet people that providence sends down always an incarnation of himself into every generation at bottom some belief in a kind of pope at bottom still better belief that there is a greatest man that he is discoverable that once discovered we ought to treat him with an obedience which knows no bounds this is the truth of grand lamaism the discoverability is the only error here the thibet priests have methods of their own of discovering what man is greatest fit to be supreme over them bad methods but are they so much worse than our methods of understanding him to be always the eldest born of a certain genealogy alas it is a difficult thing to find good methods for we shall begin to have a chance of understanding paganism when we first admit that to its followers it was at one time earnestly true let us consider it very certain that men did believe in paganism men with open eyes sound senses men made altogether like ourselves that we had we been there should have believed in it ask now what paganism could have been another theory somewhat more respectable attributes such things to allegory it was a play of poetic minds say these theorists a shadowing forth in allegorical fable in personification and visual form of what such poetic minds had known and felt of this universe which agrees add they with a primary law of human nature still everywhere observably at work though in less important things that what a man feels intensely he struggles to speak out of him to see represented before him in visual shape and as if with a kind of life and historical reality in it now doubtless there is such a law and it is one of the deepest in human nature neither need we doubt that it did operate fundamentally in this business the hypothesis which ascribes paganism wholly or mostly to this agency i call a little more respectable but i cannot yet call it the true hypothesis think would we believe and take with us as our life guidance an allegory a poetic sport not sport but earnest is what we should require it is a most earnest thing to be alive in this world to die is not sport for a man man s life never was a sport to him it was a stern reality altogether a serious matter to be alive i find therefore that though these allegory theorists are on the way towards truth in this matter they have not reached it either pagan religion is indeed an allegory a symbol of what men felt and knew about the universe and all religions are symbols of that altering always as that alters but it seems to me a radical perversion and even inversion of the business to put that forward as the origin and moving cause when it was rather the result and termination to get beautiful allegories a perfect poetic symbol was not the want of men but to know what they were to believe

found it a hard alternative to choose between such a husband and such a father brutus with his fleet and his bride betook themselves to sea and within a short time landed on a deserted island where they found the ruins of a city here there was an ancient temple of diana and an image of the goddess which image was endued with the power of uttering oracular responses to those who consulted it with proper ceremonies and forms brutus consulted this oracle on the question in what land he should find a place of final settlement his address to it was in ancient verse which some chronicler has turned into english rhyme as follows goddess of shades and huntress who at will walk st on the rolling sphere and through the deep on thy third reign the earth look now and tell what land what seat of rest thou bidd st me seek to which the oracle returned the following answer far to the west in the ocean wide beyond the realm of gaul a land there lies sea girt it lies where giants dwelt of old now void it fits thy people thither bend thy course there shalt thou find a lasting home it is scarcely necessary to say that this meant britain brutus following the directions which the oracle had given him set sail from the island and proceeded to the westward through the mediterranean sea he arrived at the pillars of hercules this was the name by which the rock of gibraltar and the corresponding promontory on the opposite coast across the straits were called in those days these cliffs having been built according to ancient tales by hercules as monuments set up to mark the extreme limits of his western wanderings brutus passed through the strait and then turning northward coasted along the shores of spain at length after enduring great privations and suffering and encountering the extreme dangers to which their frail barks were necessarily exposed from the surges which roll in perpetually from the broad atlantic ocean upon the coast of spain and into the bay of biscay they arrived safely on the shores of britain they landed and explored the interior they found the island robed in the richest drapery of fruitfulness and verdure but it was unoccupied by any thing human there were wild beasts roaming in the forests and the remains of a race of giants in dens and caves monsters as diverse from humanity as the wolves brutus and his followers attacked all these occupants of the land they drove the wild beasts into the mountains of scotland and wales and killed the giants the chief of them whose name was gogmagog was hurled by one of brutus s followers from the summit of one of the chalky cliffs which bound the island into the sea the island of great britain is in the latitude of labrador which on our side of the continent is the synonym for almost perpetual ice and snow still these wandering trojans found it a region of inexhaustible verdure fruitfulness and beauty and as to its extent though often in modern times called a little island they found its green fields and luxuriant forests extending very far and wide over the sea a length of nearly six hundred miles would seem almost to merit the name of continent and the dimensions of this detached outpost of the habitable surface of the earth would never have been deemed inconsiderable had it not been that the people by the greatness of their exploits of which the whole world has been the theater have made the physical dimensions of their territory appear so small and insignificant in comparison to brutus and his companions the land appeared a world it was nearly four hundred miles in breadth at the place where they landed and wandering northward they found it extending in almost undiminished beauty and fruitfulness further than they had the disposition to explore it they might have gone northward until the twilight scarcely disappeared in the summer nights and have found the same verdure and beauty continuing to the end there were broad and undulating plains in the southern regions of the island and in the northern green mountains and romantic glens but all plains valleys and mountains were fertile and beautiful and teeming with abundant sustenance for flocks for herds and for man brutus accordingly established himself upon the island with all his followers and founded a kingdom there over which he reigned as the founder of a dynasty endless tales are told of the lives and exploits and quarrels of his successors down to the time of c sar conflicting claimants arose continually to dispute with each other for the possession of power wars were made by one tribe

thus wore away her long sad peaceful and fantastic life till few were so old as she and the people of later generations wondered how the dead had ever been buried or mourners had endured their grief without the old maid in the winding sheet still years went on and still she followed funerals and was not yet summoned to her own festival of death one afternoon the great street of the town was all alive with business and bustle though the sun now gilded only the upper half of the church spire having left the housetops and loftiest trees in shadow the scene was cheerful and animated in spite of the sombre shade between the high brick buildings here were pompous merchants in white wigs and laced velvet the bronzed faces of sea captains the foreign garb and air of spanish creoles and the disdainful port of natives of old england all contrasted with the rough aspect of one or two hack settlers negotiating sales of timber from forests where axe had never sounded sometimes a lady passed swelling roundly forth in an embroidered petticoat balancing her steps in high heeled shoes and courtesying with lofty grace to the punctilious obeisances of the gentlemen the life of the town seemed to have its very centre not far from an old mansion that stood somewhat back from the pavement surrounded by neglected grass with a strange air of loneliness rather deepened than dispelled by the throng so near it its site would have been suitably occupied by a magnificent exchange or a brick block lettered all over with various signs or the large house itself might have made a noble tavern with the king s arms swinging before it and guests in every chamber instead of the present solitude but owing to some dispute about the right of inheritance the mansion had been long without a tenant decaying from year to year and throwing the stately gloom of its shadow over the busiest part of the town such was the scene and such the time when a figure unlike any that have been described was observed at a distance down the street i espy a strange sail yonder remarked a liverpool captain that woman in the long white garment the sailor seemed much struck by the object as were several others who at the same moment caught a glimpse of the figure that had attracted his notice almost immediately the various topics of conversation gave place to speculations in an undertone on this unwonted occurrence can there be a funeral so late this afternoon inquired some they looked for the signs of death at every door the sexton the hearse the assemblage of black clad relatives all that makes up the woeful pomp of funerals they raised their eyes also to the sun gilt spire of the church and wondered that no clang proceeded from its bell which had always tolled till now when this figure appeared in the light of day but none had heard that a corpse was to be borne to its home that afternoon nor was there any token of a funeral except the apparition of the old maid in the winding sheet what may this portend asked each man of his neighbor all smiled as they put the question yet with a certain trouble in their eyes as if pestilence or some other wide calamity were prognosticated by the untimely intrusion among the living of one whose presence had always been associated with death and woe what a comet is to the earth was that sad woman to the town still she moved on while the hum of surprise was hushed at her approach and the proud and the humble stood aside that her white garment might not wave against them it was a long loose robe of spotless purity its wearer appeared very old pale emaciated and feeble yet glided onward without the unsteady pace of extreme age at one point of her course a littly rosy boy burst forth from a door and ran with open arms towards the ghostly woman seeming to expect a kiss from her bloodless lips she made a slight pause fixing her eye upon him with an expression of no earthly sweetness so that the child shivered and stood awe struck rather than affrighted while the old maid passed on perhaps her garment might have been polluted even by an infant s touch perhaps her kiss would have been death to the sweet boy within a year she is but a

make pitt at his zenith in public reputation friedrich never so low before nothing seemingly but extinction near ahead when this year ended the truth is apart from his specific pieces of ill luck there had now begun for friedrich a new rule of procedure which much altered his appearance in the world thrice over had he tried by the aggressive or invasive method thrice over made a plunge at the enemy s heart hoping so to disarm or lame him but that with resources spent to such a degree is what he cannot do a fourth time he is too weak henceforth to think of that prussia has always its king and his unrivalled talent but that is pretty much the only fixed item prussia versus france austria russia sweden and the german reich what is it as a field of supplies for war except its king these are failing year by year and at a rate fatally swift in comparison friedrich cannot now do leuthens rossbachs far shining feats of victory which astonish all the world his fine prussian veterans have mostly perished and have been replaced by new levies and recruits who are inferior both in discipline and native quality though they have still people say a noteworthy taste of the old prussian sort in them and do in fact fight well to the last but it is observable says retzow somewhere and indeed it follows from the nature of the case that while the prussian army presents always its best kind of soldiers at the beginning of a war austria such are its resources in population always improves in that particular and its best troops appear in the last campaigns in a word friedrich stands on the defensive henceforth disputing his ground inch by inch and is reduced more and more to battle obscurely with a hydra coil of enemies and impediments and to do heroisms which make no noise in the gazettes and alas which cannot figure in history either what is more a sorrow to me here friedrich say all judges of soldiership and human character who have studied friedrich sufficiently is greater than ever in these four years now coming berenhorst in kriegskunst retzow c and this i have found more and more to be a true thing verifiable and demonstrable in time and place though unluckily for us hardly in this time or this place at all a thing which cannot by any method be made manifest to the general reader who delights in shining summary feats and is impatient of tedious preliminaries and investigations especially of maps which are the indispensablest requisite of all a thing in short that belongs peculiarly to soldier students who can undergo the dull preliminaries most dull but most inexorably needed and can follow out with watchful intelligence and with a patience not to be wearied the multifarious topographies details of movements and manoeuvrings year after year on such a

reader under such conditions as there are friedrich s winter in breslau was of secluded silent sombre character this time nothing of stir in it but from work only in marked contrast with the last and its kindly visitors and gayeties a friedrich given up to his manifold businesses to his silent sorrows i have passed my winter like a carthusian monk he writes to d argens i dine alone i spend my life in reading and writing and i do not sup when one is sad it becomes at last too burdensome to hide one s grief continually and it is better to give way to it by oneself than to carry one s gloom into society nothing solaces me but the vigorous application required in steady and continuous labor this distraction does force one to put away painful ideas while it lasts but alas no sooner is the work done than these fatal companions present themselves again as if livelier than ever maupertuis was right the sum of evil does certainly surpass that of good but to me it is all one i have almost

numbers that i verily believe its whole surface to the depth of at least eighteen inches was mounted in these monotrochs at the same moment and in the act of being transported from one place to another huge triangular piles of planks are also reared in different parts of the devoted messuage and a little group of trees that still grace the eastern end which rises in a gentle ascent have just received warning to quit expressed by a daub of white paint and are to give place to a curious grove of chimneys it would perhaps hurt others in my situation to reflect that this little range of pasturage once belonged to my father whose family was of some consideration in the world and was sold by patches to remedy distresses in which he involved himself in an attempt by commercial adventure to redeem his diminished fortune while the building scheme was in full operation this circumstance was often pointed out to me by the class of friends who are anxious that no part of your misfortunes should escape your observation such pasture ground lying at the very town s end in turnips and potatoes the parks would bring l per acre and if leased for building oh it was a gold mine and all sold for an old song out of the ancient possessor s hands my comforters cannot bring me to repine much on this subject if i could be allowed to look back on the past without interruption i could willingly give up the enjoyment of present income and the hope of future profit to those who have purchased what my father sold i regret the alteration of the ground only because it destroys associations and i would more willingly i think see the earl s closes in the hands of strangers retaining their silvan appearance than know them for my own if torn up by agriculture or covered with buildings mine are the sensations of poor logan the horrid plough has rased the green where yet a child i strayed the axe has fell d the hawthorn screen the schoolboy s summer shade i hope however the threatened devastation will not be consummated in my day although the adventurous spirit of times short while since passed gave rise to the undertaking i have been encouraged to think that the subsequent changes have so far damped the spirit of speculation that the rest of the woodland footpath leading to aunt margaret s retreat will be left undisturbed for her time and mine i am interested in this for every step of the way after i have passed through the green already mentioned has for me something of early remembrance there is the stile at which i can recollect a cross child s maid upbraiding me with my infirmity as she lifted me coarsely and carelessly over the flinty steps which my brothers traversed with shout and bound i remember the suppressed bitterness of the moment and conscious of my own inferiority the feeling of envy with which i regarded the easy movements and elastic steps of my more happily formed brethren alas these goodly barks have all perished on life s wide ocean and only that which seemed so little seaworthy as the naval phrase goes has reached the port when the tempest is over then there is the pool where manoeuvring our little navy constructed out of the broad water flags my elder brother fell in and was scarce saved from the watery element to die under nelson s banner there is the hazel copse also in which my brother henry used to gather nuts thinking little that he was to die in an indian jungle in quest of rupees there is so much more of remembrance about the little walk that as i stop rest on my crutch headed cane and look round with that species of comparison between the thing i was and that which i now am it almost induces me to doubt my own identity until i find myself in face of the honeysuckle porch of aunt margaret s dwelling with its irregularity of front and its odd projecting latticed windows where the workmen seem to have made it a study that no one of them should resemble another in form size or in the old fashioned stone entablature and labels which adorn them this tenement once the manor house of the earl s closes we still retain a slight hold upon for in some family arrangements it had been settled upon aunt margaret during the term of her life upon this frail tenure depends in a great measure the last shadow of the family of bothwell of earl s closes and their last slight connection with their paternal inheritance the only representative will then be an infirm old man moving not unwillingly to the grave which has devoured all that were dear to his affections when i have indulged such thoughts for a minute or two i enter the mansion which is said to have been the gate house only of the original building and find one being on whom time seems to have made little impression for the aunt margaret of to day bears the same proportional age to the aunt margaret of my early youth that the boy of ten years old does to the man of by r lady some fifty six years the old lady s invariable costume has doubtless some share in confirming one in the opinion that time has stood still with aunt margaret the brown or chocolate coloured silk gown with ruffles of the same stuff at the elbow within which are others of mechlin lace the black silk gloves or mitts the white hair combed back upon a roll and the cap of spotless cambric which closes around the venerable countenance as they were not the

playthings or tools or materials to work with jonas said he should be very glad to do it for he thought he could buy him some things that would help him very much in his work jonas carried the money into the city the next time he went and bought him a small hone to sharpen his knife a fine toothed saw and a bottle of black varnish with a little brush to put it on with he brought these things home and gave them to georgie s father and he carried them into the house and put them in a drawer that evening when georgie was at supper his father slyly put the things that jonas had bought on his table so that when he went back after supper he found them there he was very much surprised and pleased he examined them all very particularly and was especially glad to have the black varnish for now he could varnish his work and make it look much more handsome the little boxes that he made after this of a bright black outside and lined neatly with paper within were thought by the boys to be elegant he could now earn money faster and as his father insisted on having all his earnings expended for articles for georgie s own use and jonas used to help him about expending it he got at last quite a variety of implements and articles he had some wire and a little pair of pliers for bending it in all shapes and a hammer and little nails he had also a paint box and brushes and paper of various colors for lining boxes and making portfolios and pocket books and he had varnishes red green blue and black all these he kept in his drawers and shelves and made a great many ingenious things with them so georgie was a great friend of both rollo and jonas and they often used to come and see him and play with him and that was the reason that rollo knew his voice so well when he called to him from the landing when rollo was standing on the bridge as described in the beginning of this story two good friends rollo ran along to the end of the bridge clambered down to the water s edge went along the shore among the trees and shrubbery until he came to the seat where georgie was sitting georgie asked him to sit down and stay with him but rollo said he must go directly home and so georgie took his crutches and they began to walk slowly together up the garden walk where have you been rollo said georgie i have been to see my cousin james to ask him to go to the city with us to morrow are you going to the city yes uncle george gave james and i a half a dollar apiece the other day and mother is going to carry us into the city to morrow to buy something with it is jonas going with you yes said rollo he is going to drive we are going in our carryall i wish you would take some money for me then and get jonas to buy me something with it well i will said rollo what shall he buy for you o he may buy any thing he chooses yes but if you do not tell him what to buy he may buy something you have got already o jonas knows every thing i have got as well as i do just then they came up near the house and georgie asked rollo to look up at the golden pippin tree and see how full it was that is my branch said he he pointed to a large branch which came out on one side and which hung down loaded with fruit it would have broken down perhaps if there had not been a crotched pole put under it to prop it up but all the apples on your branch are not golden pippins said rollo there are some on it that are red what beautiful red apples yes said georgie father grafted that for me to make it bear rosy boys i call the red ones my rosy boys grafted said rollo how did he graft it o said georgie i do not know exactly he cut off a little branch from a rosy boy tree and stuck it on somehow and it grew and bears rosy boys still rollo thought this was very curious georgie told him he would give him an apple and that he might have his choice a pippin or a rosy boy rollo hesitated and looked at them first at one and then at another but he could not decide the rosy boys had the brightest and most beautiful color but then the pippins looked so rich and mellow that he could not choose very easily and so georgie laughed and told him he would settle the difficulty by giving him one of each so come here said he rollo and let me lean on you while i knock them down so rollo came and stood near him while georgie leaned on him and with his crutch gave a gentle tap to one of each of his kinds of apples and they fell down upon the soft grass safe and sound illustration they then went into the house and georgie gave rollo his money wrapped up in a small piece of paper and then rollo bidding him good by went out of the little white gate and walked along home the next morning soon after breakfast jonas drove the carryall up to the front door and rollo and his mother walked out to it rollo s mother took the back seat and rollo and jonas sat in front and they drove along they called at the house where james lived and found him waiting for them on the front steps with his half dollar in his hand he ran into the house to tell his mother that the carryall had come and to bid her good morning and then he came out to the gate james said rollo you may sit on the front seat with jonas if you want to james said he should like to very much and so rollo stepped over behind and sat with his mother this was kind and polite for boys all like the front seat when they are riding and rollo therefore did right to offer it to his cousin a lecture on playthings after a short time they came to a smooth and pleasant road with trees and farmhouses on each side and as the horse was

fleet safely through the dangerous shoals and rocks of that inland sea so careful and correct was he in all that he did that men in power and in high places began to take special notice of him and finally when in the year an expedition of importance was about to be sent to the southern seas for scientific purposes cook was chosen to command it this was indeed a high honour for the success of that expedition depended on the man who should be placed at its head in order to mark the importance of the command and at the same time invest the commander with proper authority cook was promoted to the rank of lieutenant in the royal navy he had long been a gentleman in heart and conduct he was now raised to the social position of one by the king s commission from this point in his career cook s history as a great navigator and discoverer began we shall now follow him more closely in his brilliant course over the world of waters he was about forty years of age at this time modest and unassuming in manners and appearance upwards of six feet high and good looking with quick piercing eyes and brown hair which latter he wore according to the fashion of the time tied behind in a pig tail it was not until the end of his first voyage that he was promoted to the rank of captain chapter two shows what men will do and dare in the cause of science men who study the stars tell us strange and wonderful things things that the unlearned find it hard to understand and harder still to believe yet things that we are now as sure of as we are of the fact that two and two make four there was a time when men said that the sun moved round the earth and very natural it was in men to say so for to the eye of sense it looks as if this were really the case but those who study the stars have found out that the earth moves round the sun a discovery which has been of the greatest importance to mankind though the importance thereof cannot be fully understood except by scientific men among other difficult things these astronomers have attempted to measure the distance of the sun moon and stars from our earth moreover they have tried to ascertain the exact size of these celestial lights and they have to a considerable extent been successful in their efforts by their complicated calculations the men who study the stars can tell the exact day hour and minute when certain events will happen such as an eclipse of the sun or of the moon now about the year the attention of the scientific world was eagerly turned to an event which was to take place in the following year this was the passage of the planet venus across the face of the sun astronomers term this the transit of venus it happens very seldom it occurred in but not again till and by observing this passage this transit of venus across the sun from different parts of our earth it was hoped that such information could be obtained as would enable us to measure not only the distance of the sun from the earth with greater accuracy than heretofore but also the extent of the whole host of stars that move with our earth around the sun and form what is called our solar system an opportunity occurring so seldom was not to be lost learned men were sent to all parts of the world to observe the event among others captain cook was sent to the south seas there among the far off coral isles to note the passage of a little star across the sun s face an apparently trifling though in reality important event in the history of science so much for the object of cook s first voyage let us now turn to the details thereof the vessel chosen by him for his long and dangerous voyage to unknown seas was a small one of only tons burden it was named the endeavour the crew consisted of forty one seamen twelve marines and nine servants these with the officers and the scientific men of the expedition made up a body of eighty five persons the scientific men above mentioned were mr green an astronomer mr banks a naturalist who afterwards became sir joseph banks and a celebrated man doctor solander who was also a naturalist and two draughtsmen one of whom was skilled in drawing objects of natural history the other in taking views of scenery the endeavour was victualled for a cruise of eighteen months she was a three masted vessel of the barque rig and carried twenty two large guns besides a store of small arms for the region of the world to which they were bound was inhabited by savages against whom they might find it necessary to defend themselves when all was ready captain cook hoisted his flag and spread his sails and on the th of august the voyage began england soon dropped out of sight astern and ere long the blue sky above and the blue sea below were all that remained for the eyes of the navigators to rest upon it is a wonderful thought when we come to consider it the idea of going to sea to sailors who are used to it the thought indeed may be very commonplace and to lazy minds that are not much given to think deeply upon any subject the thought may not appear very wonderful but it is so nevertheless to us men of the land when we calmly sit down and ponder the idea of making to ourselves a house of planks and beams of wood launching it upon the sea loading it with food and merchandise setting up tall poles above its roof spreading great sheets thereon and then rushing out upon the troubled waters of the great deep there for days and nights for weeks and months and even years to brave the fury of the winds and waves with nothing between us and death except a wooden

chinese protection of american ships against such outrages art the united states of america and his majesty the emperor of china believing that the safety and prosperity of commerce will thereby best be promoted agree that any privilege or immunity in respect to trade or navigation within the chinese dominions which may not have been stipulated for by treaty shall be subject to the discretion of the chinese government and may be regulated by it accordingly but not in a manner or spirit incompatible with the treaty stipulations of the parties at a first glance this clause would seem unnecessary unnecessary because the granting of any privilege not stipulated in a treaty with china must of course be a matter entirely subject to the pleasure of the chinese government yet the clause has its significance there is in china a class of foreigners who demand privileges concessions and immunities instead of asking for them a class who look upon the chinese as degraded barbarians and not entitled to charity as helpless and therefore to be trodden underfoot a tyrannical class who say openly that the chinese should be forced to do thus and so that foreigners know what is best for them better than they do themselves and therefore it would be but a christian kindness to take them by the throat and compel them to see their real interests as the enlightened foreigners see them these people harass and distress the government by constantly dictating to it and meddling with its affairs they beget and keep alive a distrust of foreigners among the chinese people it will surprise many among us to know that the chinese are eminently hospitable by nature toward strangers it will surprise many whose notion of chinamen is that they are a race who formerly manifested their interest in shipwrecked strangers by exhibiting them in iron cages in public in a half starved condition as rare and curious monsters to know that a few hundred years ago they welcomed adventurous jesuit priests who struggled to their shores with great cordiality and gave to them the fullest liberty in the dissemination of their doctrines i have seen at st peter s in rome a picture of certain restive chinamen barbecuing some romish priests this was an uncalled for stretch of hospitality if it be proposed to call it hospitality at all but the caging and barbecuing of strangers were disagreeable attentions which were secured to those strangers by their predecessors as i have said the chinese were exceedingly hospitable and kind toward the first foreigners who came among them or years ago they listened to their preachings they joined their church they saw the doctrines of christianity spreading far and wide over the land yet nobody murmured against these things the jesuit priests were elevated to high offices in the government china s confidence in the foreigners was not betrayed in time had the jesuits been let alone they would have completely christianized china no doubt that is they would have made of the chinese christians according to their moral physical and intellectual strength and then given nature a few generations in which to shed the pagan skin and sap the pagan blood and so perfect the work for be it known one jesuit missionary is equal to an army of any other denomination where there is actual work to be done and solid unsentimental wisdom to be exercised however to pursue my narrative some priests of the dominican order arrived and very shortly began to make trouble they began to cramp the privileges of converts they flouted the system of persuasion of the jesuits and adopted that of driving they meddled in politics they became arrogant and dictatorial they fomented discords everywhere in a word they utterly destroyed chinese confidence in foreigners and raised up chinese hatred and distrust against them for these things they were driven out of the country when strangers came after that the chinese with that calm wisdom which comes only through bitter experience caged them or hanged them i spoke a while ago of a domineering hectoring class of foreigners in china who are always interfering with the government s business and thus keeping alive the distrust and dislike engendered by their kindred spirits the dominicans an age ago they clog progress article of the treaty is intended to discountenance all officious intermeddling with the government s business by americans and so move a step toward the restoration of that chinese confidence in strangers which was annihilated so long ago art the emperor of china shall have the right to appoint consuls at ports of the united states who shall enjoy the same privileges and immunities as those which are enjoyed by public law and treaty in the united states by the consuls of great britain and russia or either of them and soon perhaps within a year or two there will doubtless be a chinese envoy located permanently at washington the consuls referred to above will be appointed with all convenient dispatch they will be americans but will in all cases be men who are capable of feeling pity for persecuted chinamen and will call to a strict account all who wrong them

soft notes as yet musician s cunning never gave the enraptured air there was a rustling that seemed like a bustling of merry crowds justling at pitching and hustling small feet were pattering wooden

normal phenomena coupled with this hankering after theories built upon exceptional ones this craving for signs and wonders which is the sure accompaniment of a dying faith in god and in nature as god s work are symptoms which make me tremble for the fate of physical as well as of spiritual science both in america and in the americanists here at home as the professor talked on i could not help thinking of the neo platonists of alexandria and their exactly similar course downward from a spiritualism of notions and emotions which in every term confessed its own materialism to the fearful discovery that consciousness does not reveal god not even matter but only its own existence and then onward in desperate search after something external wherein to trust towards theurgic fetish worship and the secret virtues of gems and flowers and stars and last of all to the lowest depth of bowing statues and winking pictures the sixth century saw that career templeton the nineteenth may see it re enacted with only these differences that the nature worship which seems coming will be all the more crushing and slavish because we know so much better how vast and glorious nature is and that the superstitions will be more clumsy and foolish in proportion as our saxon brain is less acute and discursive and our education less severely scientific than those of the old greeks silence raver cried templeton throwing himself on the grass in fits of laughter so the professor s grandchildren will have either turned papists or be bowing down before rusty locomotives and broken electric telegraphs but my good friend you surely do not take professor windrush for a fair sample of the great american people god forbid that so unpractical a talker should be a sample of the most practical people upon earth the americans have their engineers their geographers their astronomers their scientific chemists few indeed but such as bid fair to rival those of any nation upon earth but these like other true workers hold their tongues and do their business and they have a few indigenous authors too you must have read the biglow papers and the fable for critics and last but not least uncle

their present borrowed peacocks feathers have fallen off to come forth and prove that the yankee eagle is a right gallant bird if he will but trust to his own natural plumage and they have a few statesmen also but they are curt plain spoken practical in everything antipodal to the knot of hapless men who unable from some defect or morbidity to help on the real movement of their nation are

where they arose and the very froth and scum of the medea s caldron in which the disjecta membra of old calvinism are pitiably seething ah it has been always the plan you know in england as well as in america courteously to avoid taking up a german theory till the germans had quite done with it and thrown it away for something new but what are we to say of those who are trying to introduce into england these very americanised germanisms as the only teaching which can suit the needs of the old world we will if we are in a vulgar humour apply to them a certain old proverb about teaching one s grandmother a certain simple operation on the egg of the domestic fowl but we will no less take shame to ourselves as sons of alma mater that such nonsense can get even a day s hearing either among the daughters of manchester manufacturers or among london working men had we taught them what we were taught in the schools templeton alas my friend we must ourselves have learnt it first i have no

english girl will always remember that in each one she so meets she may find an admirer whom she may possibly love or an admirer whom she may probably be called on to repel she is ever conscious of the fact of this position and a romance is thus engendered which if it may at times be dangerous is at any rate always charming but the german girl in her simplicity has no such consciousness as you and i my reader might probably become dear friends were we to meet and know each other so may the german girl learn to love the fair haired youth with whom chance has for a time associated her but to

passion for daily excitement might call her phlegmatic but we should call her so unjustly life to her was a serious matter of which the daily duties and daily wants were sufficient to occupy her thoughts she was her mother s companion the instructress of both her brother and her sister and the charm of her father s vacant hours with such calls upon her time and so many realities around her her imagination did not teach her to look for joys beyond those of her present life and home when love and marriage should come to her as come they probably might she would endeavour to attune herself to a new happiness and a new sphere of duties in the meantime she was contented to keep her mother s accounts and look after her brother and sister up two pair of stairs in the ludwigs strasse but change would certainly come we may prophesy for isa heine was a beautiful girl tall and graceful comely to the eye and fit in every way to be loved and cherished as the partner of a man s home i have said that an english clerk made a part of that small establishment in the dingy banking office in the schrannen platz and i must say a word or two of herbert onslow in his early career he had not been fortunate his father with means sufficiently moderate and with a family more than sufficiently large had sent him to a public school at which he had been very idle and then to one of the universities at which he had run into debt and had therefore left without a degree when this occurred a family council of war had been held among the onslows and it was decided that herbert should be sent off to the banking house of heines at munich there being a cousinship between the families and some existing connections of business it was therefore so settled and herbert willing enough to see the world as he considered he should do by going to munich started for his german home with injunctions very tender from his mother and very solemn from his aggrieved father but there was nothing bad at the heart about young onslow and if the solemn father had well considered it he might perhaps have felt that those debts at cambridge reflected more fault on him than on his son when herbert arrived at munich his cousins the heines far away cousins though they were behaved kindly to him they established him at first in lodgings where he was boarded with many others having heard somewhat of his early youth but when madame heine at the end of twelve months perceived that he was punctual at the bank and that his allowances which though moderate in england were handsome in munich carried him on without debt she opened her motherly arms and suggested to his mother and to himself that he should live with them in this way he also was domiciled up two pairs of stairs in the palatial residence in the ludwigs strasse but all this happened long ago isa heine had been only seventeen when her cousin had first come to munich and had made acquaintance with him rather as a child than as a woman and when as she ripened into womanhood this young man came more closely among them it did not strike her that the change would affect her more powerfully than it would the others her uncle and father she knew had approved of herbert at the bank and herbert had shown that he could be steady therefore he was to be taken into their family paying his annual subsidy instead of being left with strangers at the boarding house all this was very simple to her she assisted in mending his linen as she did her father s she visited his room daily as she visited all the others she took notice of his likings and dislikings as touching their table arrangement but by no means such notice as she did of her father s and without any flutter inwardly in her imagination or outwardly as regarded the world she made him one of the family so things went on for a year nay so things went on for two years with her after herbert onslow had come to the ludwigs strasse but the matter had been regarded in a very different light by herbert himself when the proposition had been made to him his first idea had been that so close a connection with a girl so very pretty would be delightful he had blushed as he had given in his adhesion but madame heine when she saw the blush had attributed it to anything but the true cause when isa had asked him as to his wants

acquainted first that i was destined to be unlucky in life and secondly that i was privileged to see ghosts and spirits both these gifts inevitably attaching as they believed to all unlucky infants of either gender born towards the small hours on a friday night i need say nothing here on the first head because nothing can show better than my history whether that prediction was verified or falsified by the result on the second branch of the question i will only remark that unless i ran through that part of my inheritance while i was still a baby i have not come into it yet but i do not at all complain of having been kept out of this property and if anybody else should be in the present enjoyment of it he is heartily welcome to keep it i was born with a caul which was advertised for sale in the newspapers at the low price of fifteen guineas whether sea going people were short of money about that time or were short of faith and preferred cork jackets i don t know all i know is that there was but one solitary bidding and that was from an attorney connected with the bill broking business who offered two pounds in cash and the balance in sherry but declined to be guaranteed from drowning on any higher bargain consequently the advertisement was withdrawn at a dead loss for as to sherry my poor dear mother s own sherry was in the market then and ten years afterwards the caul was put up in a raffle down in our part of the country to fifty members at half a crown a head the winner to spend five shillings i was present myself and i remember to have felt quite uncomfortable and confused at a part of myself being disposed of in that way the caul was won i recollect by an old lady with a hand basket who very reluctantly produced from it the stipulated five shillings all in halfpence and twopence halfpenny short as it took an immense time and a great waste of arithmetic to endeavour without any effect to prove to her it is a fact which will be long remembered as remarkable down there that she was never drowned but died triumphantly in bed at ninety two i have understood that it was to the last her proudest boast that she never had been on the water in her life except upon a bridge and that over her tea to which she was extremely partial she to the last expressed her indignation at the impiety of mariners and others who had the presumption to go meandering about the world it was in vain to represent to her that some conveniences tea perhaps included resulted from this objectionable practice she always returned with greater emphasis and with an instinctive knowledge of the strength of her objection let us have no meandering not to meander myself at present i will go back to my birth i was born at blunderstone in suffolk or there by as they say in scotland i was a

something stranger yet in the shadowy remembrance that i have of my first childish associations with his white grave stone in the churchyard and of the indefinable compassion i used to feel for it

handsome except in the sense of the homely adage handsome is that handsome does for he was strongly suspected of having beaten miss betsey and even of having once on a disputed question of supplies made some hasty but determined arrangements to throw her out of a two pair of stairs window these evidences of an incompatibility of temper induced miss betsey to pay him off and effect a separation by mutual consent he went to india with his capital and there according to a wild legend in our family he was once seen riding on an elephant in company with a baboon but i think it must have been a baboo or a begum anyhow from india tidings of his death reached home within ten years how they affected my aunt nobody knew for immediately upon the separation she took her maiden name again bought a

the stiller depths of the ocean but the finer and lighter particles are carried further on and eventually deposited in a deeper and stiller portion of the ocean it clearly follows from this that mud gives us a chronology for it is evident that supposing this which i now sketch to be the sea bottom and supposing this to be a coast line from the washing action of the sea upon the rock wearing and grinding it down into a sediment of mud the mud will be carried down and at length deposited in the deeper parts of this sea bottom where it will form a layer and then while that first layer is hardening other mud which is coming from the same source will of course be carried to the same place and as it is quite impossible for it to get beneath the layer already there it deposits itself above it and forms another layer and in that way you gradually have layers of mud constantly forming and hardening one above the other and conveying a record of time it is a necessary result of the operation of the law of gravitation that the uppermost layer shall be the youngest and the lowest the oldest and that the different beds shall be older at any particular point or spot in exactly the ratio of their depth from the surface so that if they were upheaved afterwards and you had a series of these different layers of mud converted into sandstone or limestone as the case might be you might be sure that the bottom layer was deposited first and that the upper layers were formed afterwards here you see is the first step in the history these layers of mud give us an idea of time the whole surface of the earth i speak broadly and leave out minor qualifications is made up of such layers of mud so hard the majority of them that we call them rock whether limestone or sandstone or other varieties of rock and seeing that every part of the crust of the earth is made up in this way you might think that the determination of the chronology the fixing of the time which it has taken to form this crust is a comparatively simple matter take a broad average ascertain how fast the mud is deposited upon the bottom of the sea or in the estuary of rivers take it to be an inch or two or three inches a year or whatever you may roughly estimate it at then take the total thickness of the whole series of stratified rocks which geologists estimate at twelve or thirteen miles or about seventy thousand feet make a sum in short division divide the total thickness by that of the quantity deposited in one year and the result will of course give you the number of years which the crust has taken to form truly that looks a very simple process it would be so except for certain difficulties the very first of which is that of finding how rapidly sediments are deposited but the main difficulty a difficulty which renders any certain calculations of such a matter out of the question is this the sea bottom on which the deposit takes place is continually shifting instead of the surface of the earth being that stable fixed thing that it is popularly believed to be being in common parlance the very emblem of fixity itself it is incessantly moving and is in fact as unstable as the surface of the sea except that its undulations are infinitely slower and enormously higher and deeper now what is the effect of this oscillation take the case to which i have previously referred the finer or coarser sediments that are carried down by the current of the river will only be carried out a certain distance and eventually as we have already seen on reaching the stiller part of the ocean will be deposited at the bottom let c y fig be the sea bottom y d the shore x y the sea level then the coarser deposit will subside over the region b the finer over a while beyond a there will be no deposit at all and consequently no record will be kept simply because no deposit is going on now suppose that the whole land c d which we have regarded as stationary goes down as it does so both a and b go further out from the shore which will be at y x y being the new sea level the consequence will be that the layer of mud a being now for the most part further than the force of the current is strong enough to convey even the finest debris will of course receive no more deposits and having attained a certain thickness will now grow no thicker we should b

boots three or four times made a sad inroad during the holidays in mr grey s bottle of claret and was reported as having once sworn at the butler the young gentleman began also to hint during every vacation that the fellows at flummery s were somewhat too small for his companionship and first bud of puppyism the former advocate of straight hair now expended a portion of his infant income in the purchase of macassar and began to cultivate his curls mrs grey could not entertain for a moment the idea of her son s associating with children the eldest of whom to adopt his own account was not above eight years old so flummery it was determined he should leave but where to go mr grey was for eton but his lady was one of those women whom nothing in the world can persuade that a public school is anything else but a place where boys are roasted alive and so with tears and taunts and supplications the point of private education was conceded at length it was resolved that the only hope should remain at home a season until some plan should be devised for the cultivation of his promising understanding during this year vivian became a somewhat more constant intruder into the library than heretofore and living so much among books he was insensibly attracted to those silent companions that speak so eloquently how far the character of the parent may influence the character of the child the metaphysician must decide certainly the character of vivian grey underwent at this period of his life a sensible change doubtless constant communion with a mind highly refined severely cultivated and much experienced cannot but produce a beneficial impression even upon a mind formed and upon principles developed how infinitely more powerful must the influence of such communion be upon a youthful heart ardent innocent and unpractised as vivian was not to figure in the microcosm of a public school a place for which from his temper he was almost better fitted than any young genius whom the playing fields of eton or the hills of winton can remember there was some difficulty in fixing upon his future academus mr grey s two axioms were first that no one so young as his son should settle in the metropolis and that vivian must consequently not have a private tutor and secondly that all private schools were quite worthless and therefore there was every probability of vivian not receiving any education whatever at length an exception to axiom second started up in the establishment of mr dallas this gentleman was a clergyman a profound grecian and a poor man he had edited the

the school room door opened and mr dallas accompanied by vivian entered a dandy by jove whispered st leger smith what a knowing set out squeaked johnson secundus mammy sick growled barlow primus this last exclamation was however a scandalous libel for certainly no being ever stood in a pedagogue s presence with more perfect sang froid and with a bolder front than did at this moment vivian grey one principle in mr dallas s system was always to introduce a new comer in school hours he was thus carried immediately in medias res and the curiosity of his co mates being in a great degree satisfied at the time when that curiosity could not personally annoy him the new comer was of course much better prepared to make his way when the absence of the ruler became a signal for some oral communication with the arrival however in the present instance the young savages at burnsley vicarage had caught a tartar and in a very few days vivian grey was decidedly the most popular fellow in the school he was so dashing so devilish good tempered so completely up to everything the magnates of the land were certainly rather jealous of his success but their very sneers bore witness to his popularity cursed puppy whispered st leger smith thinks himself knowing squeaked johnson secundus thinks himself witty growled barlow primus notwithstanding this cabal days rolled on at burnsley vicarage only to witness the increase of vivian s popularity although more deficient than most of his own age in accurate classical attainments he found himself in talents and various acquirements immeasurably their superior and singular is it that at school distinction in such points is ten thousand times more admired by the multitude than the most profound knowledge of greek metres or the most accurate

canopy with embossings of gold borne over him and was guarded with twelve lances from the waist to the ground was all cloth of gold and that very rich in the attire of his head were finely wreathed in diverse rings of plaited gold of an inch or more in breadth which made a fair and princely show somewhat resembling a crown in form about his neck he had a chain of perfect gold the links very great and one fold double on his left hand was a diamond an emerald a ruby and a turky on his right hand in one ring a big and perfect turky and in another ring many diamonds of a smaller size all this glitter of barbaric gold was the produce of the spice trade of which the sultans kept the monopoly and by which they became wealthy ternate with the small islands in a line south of it as far as batchian constitute the ancient moluccas the native country of the clove as well as the only part in which it was cultivated nutmegs and mace were procured from the natives of new guinea and the adjacent islands where they grew wild and the profits on spice cargoes were so enormous that the european traders were glad to give gold and jewels and the finest manufactures of europe or of india in exchange when the dutch established their influence in these seas and relieved the native princes from their portuguese oppressors they saw that the easiest way to repay themselves would be to get this spice trade into their own hands for this purpose they adopted the wise principle of concentrating the culture of these valuable products in those spots only of which they could have complete control to do this effectually it was necessary to abolish the culture and trade in all other places which they succeeded in doing by treaty with the native rulers these agreed to have all the spice trees in their possessions destroyed they gave up large though fluctuating revenues but they gained in return a fixed subsidy freedom from the constant attacks and harsh oppressions of the portuguese and a continuance of their regal power and exclusive authority over their own subjects which is maintained in all the islands except ternate to this day it is no doubt supposed by most englishmen who have been accustomed to look upon this act of the dutch with vague horror as something utterly unprincipled and barbarous that the native population suffered grievously by this destruction of such valuable property but it is certain that this was not the case the sultans kept this lucrative trade entirely in their own hands as a rigid monopoly and they would take care not to give their subjects more than would amount to their usual wages while they would surely exact as large a quantity of spice as they could possibly obtain drake and other early voyagers always seem to have purchased their spice cargoes from the sultans and rajahs and not from the cultivators now the absorption of so much labour in the cultivation of this one product must necessarily have raised the price of food and other necessaries and when it was abolished more rice would be grown more sago made more fish caught and more tortoise shell rattan gum dammer and other valuable products of the seas and the forests would be obtained i believe therefore that this abolition of the spice trade in the moluccas was actually beneficial to the inhabitants and that it was an act both wise in itself and morally and politically justifiable in the selection of the places in which to carry on the cultivation the dutch were not altogether fortunate or wise banda was chosen for nutmegs and was eminently successful since it continues to this day to produce a large supply of this spice and to yield a considerable revenue amboyna was fixed upon for establishing the clove cultivation but the soil and climate although apparently very similar to that of its native islands is not favourable and for some years the government have actually been paying to the cultivators a higher rate than they could purchase cloves elsewhere owing to a great fall in the price since the rate of payment was fixed for a term of years by the dutch government and which rate is still most honourably paid in walking about the suburbs of ternate we find everywhere the ruins of massive stone and brick buildings gateways and arches showing at once the superior wealth of the ancient town and the destructive effects of earthquakes it was during my second stay in the town after my return from new guinea that i first felt an earthquake it was a very slight one scarcely more than has been felt in this country but occurring in a place that lad been many times destroyed by them it was rather more exciting i had just awoke at gun fire a m when suddenly the thatch began to rustle and shake as if an army of cats were galloping over it and immediately afterwards my bed shook too so that for an instant i imagined myself back in new guinea in my fragile house which shook when an old cock went to roost on the ridge but remembering that i was now on a solid earthen floor i said to myself why it s an earthquake and lay still in the pleasing expectation of another shock but none came and this was the only earthquake i ever felt in ternate the last great one was in february when almost every house in the place was destroyed it began about midnight on the chinese new year s festival at which time every one stays up nearly all night feasting at the chinamen s houses and seeing the processions this prevented any lives being lost as every one ran out of doors at the first shock which was not very severe the second a few minutes afterwards threw down a great many houses and others which continued all night and part of the next day completed the devastation the line of disturbance was very

the bargain is still advantageous to the foreigner because the commodity which he receives in exchange though it has cost us less would have cost him more as often as a country possesses two commodities one of which it can produce with less labour comparatively to what it would cost in a foreign country than the other so often it is the interest of the country to export the first mentioned commodity and to import the second even though it might be able to produce both the one and the other at a less expense of labour than the foreign country can produce them but not less in the same degree or might be unable to produce either except at a greater expense but not greater in the same degree on the contrary if it produces both commodities with greater facility or both with greater difficulty and greater in exactly the same degree there will be no motive to interchange if the cloth and the corn each of which required days labour in poland required each days labour in england it would follow that the cloth of days labour in england if sent to poland would be equal to the cloth of days labour in poland if exchanged for corn therefore it would exchange for the corn of only days labour but the corn of days labour in poland was supposed to be the same quantity with that of days labour in england with days labour in cloth therefore england would only get as much corn in poland as she could raise with days labour at home and she would in importing it have the cost of carriage besides in these circumstances no exchange would take place if on the other hand while the cloth produced with days labour in poland was produced with days labour in england the corn which was produced in poland with days labour could not be produced in england with less than days labour an adequate motive to exchange would immediately arise with a quantity of cloth which england produced with days labour she would be able to purchase as much corn in poland as was there produced with days labour but the quantity which was there produced with days labour would be as great as the quantity produced in england with days labour the power of poland would be reciprocal with a quantity of corn which cost her days labour equal to the quantity produced in england by days labour she could in the supposed case purchase in england the produce of days labour in cloth but the produce of days labour in england in the article of cloth would be equal to the produce of days labour in poland the remainder of what mr ricardo has done for the philosophical exposition of the principles of foreign trade is to shew that the truth of the propositions now recapitulated is not affected by the introduction of money as a medium of exchange the precious metals always tending to distribute themselves in such a manner throughout the commercial world that every country shall import all that it would have imported and export all that it would have exported if exchanges had taken place as in the example above supposed by barter to this branch of the subject we shall in the sequel of this essay return at present it will be more convenient that we should continue to suppose that exchanges take place by the direct trucking of one commodity against another it is established that the advantage which two countries derive from trading with each other results from the more advantageous employment which thence arises of the labour and capital for shortness let us say the labour of both jointly the circumstances are such that if each country confines itself to the production of one commodity there is a greater total return to the labour of both together and this increase of produce forms the whole of what the two countries taken together gain by the trade it is the purpose of the present essay to inquire in what proportion the increase of produce arising from the saving of labour is divided between the two countries this question was not entered into by mr ricardo whose attention was engrossed by far more important questions and who having a science to create had not time or room to occupy himself with much more than the leading principles when he had done enough to enable any one who came after him and who took the necessary pains to do all the rest he was satisfied he very rarely followed out the principles of the science into the ramifications of their consequences but we believe that to no one who has thoroughly entered into the spirit of his discoveries will even the minutiae of the science offer any difficulty but that which is constituted by the necessity of patience and circumspection in tracing principles to their results mr ricardo while intending to go no further into the question of the advantage of foreign trade than to show what it consisted of and under what circumstances it arose unguardedly expressed himself as if each of the two countries making the exchange separately gained the whole of the difference between the comparative costs of the two commodities in one country and in the other but the whole gain of both countries together consisting in the saving of labour and the saving of labour being exactly equal to the difference between the costs in the two countries of the one commodity as compared with the other the two countries taken together gain no more than this difference and if either country gains the whole of it the other country derives no advantage from the trade suppose for example that yards of broad cloth cost in england as much labour as yards of linen and in germany as much as if england sends yards of broad cloth to germany and is able to exchange them for linen according to the german cost of production sh

grace met me with extended arms she wept on my bosom for many minutes she was dreadfully agitated as it was though happily she knew nothing of the cause of chloe s screams and of the confusion on deck

our attention all kneeling in both cabins while the good simple minded old man read some of the collects the lord s prayer and concluded with the thanksgiving for a safe return from sea he would have given us the marriage ceremony itself before he would have gone out of the prayer book for any united worship whatever it was impossible not to smile at this last act of pious simplicity while it was equally impossible not to be touched with such an evidence of sincere devotion the offering had a soothing influence on all our feelings and most especially on those of the excited females as i came

wide berth a precaution i long regretted not having used at first as mrs drewett and her two daughters refused to quit andrew we had the whole family added to our party as it might be per force i confess to having been sufficiently selfish to complain a little to myself only however at always finding these people in my way during the brief intervals i now enjoyed of being near lucy as there

perfect obedience perfect unselfishness perfect generosity perfect self sacrificing love is what we are to look at in passion week this i believe is what we are meant to copy in passion week that we may learn the habit of copying it all our lives long why should not we then keep passion week somewhat as our lord kept it before us not by merely hiding in our closets to meditate even about him but by going about our work each in his place dutifully bravely as he went by doing the duty which lies nearest us and trying to draw our lesson out of it thus we may keep passion week in spirit and in truth though some of us may hardly have time to enter a church hardly have time for an hour s private thought about religion amid the bustle of daily duties amid the buzz of petty cares amid the anxieties of great labours amid the roar of the busy world which cannot stop and which ought not to stop for our convenience we may keep passion week in spirit and in truth if we will do the duty which lies nearest us and try to draw our lesson out of it for practice and i believe practice alone will teach us to restrain ourselves and conquer ourselves experience and i believe experience alone will show us our own faults and weaknesses every man every human spirit on god s earth has spiritual enemies habits and principles within him if not other spirits without him which hinder him more or less from being all that god meant him to be and we must find out those enemies and measure their strength not merely by reading of them in books not merely by fancying them in our own minds but by the hard blows and sudden falls which they too often give us in the actual battle of daily life and how can we find them out this at least we can do we can ask ourselves at every turn for what end am i doing this and this for what end am i living at all for myself or for others am i living for ambition for fame for show for money for pleasure if so i have not the mind of christ i have not found

quite clear the lake itself however is of course gradually filling up by means of this process there are several large and handsome houses on the northern shore of the lake but geneva at the western end of it entirely surpasses them all geneva is however after all a comparatively small town it contains only thirty or forty thousand inhabitants it would take ten genevas to make a new york and nearly a hundred to make a paris or london why then since geneva is comparatively so small is it so celebrated almost every person who goes to europe visits geneva and talks of geneva when he comes back while there are multitudes of other cities and towns many times as large in extent and population that he never thinks of or speaks of at all there are several reasons for this the first reason is that this town stands on the great high road leading from england and france into italy of course it comes naturally in the way of all travellers making the grand tour it is true that at the present day since steam has been introduced upon the mediterranean a very large proportion of travellers instead of passing through switzerland go down the rhone to marseilles and embark there but before the introduction of steam for many ages the way by geneva was almost the only way to italy and the city acquired great celebrity through the accounts of tourists and travellers who visited it on their journeys the second reason is that geneva is a convenient and agreeable point for entering switzerland and for making excursions among the alps there are two great avenues into switzerland from france and germany one by way of geneva and the other by way of basle by the way of basle we go to the jungfrau and the oberland alps which lie around that mountain and to the beautiful lakes of zurich and of lucerne all these lie in the eastern part of the alpine region by the way of geneva we go to the valley of chamouni and mont blanc and visit the vast glaciers and the stupendous mountain scenery that lie around this great monarch of the alps there is a great question among travellers which of these two alpine regions is the most grand some prefer the mountains about mont blanc which are called the alps of savoy others like better those about the jungfrau which are called the oberland alps the scenery and the objects of interest are very different in the two localities and it seems to me that any difference which travellers may observe in the grandeur of the emotions which they severally produce upon the mind must be due to the peculiar circumstances or moods of mind in which they are visited it is true you can get nearer to the jungfrau than you can to mont blanc and so can obtain a more impressive view of his icy and rocky sides and glittering summit but then on the other hand mont blanc is really the highest peak and is looked upon as the great monarch of them all and here as the name of mont blanc will of course often appear in this volume i have a word or two to say in respect to the proper pronunciation of it in america for the proper mode of pronouncing the name of any place is not fixed as many persons think but varies with the language which you are using in speaking of it thus the name of the capital of france when we are in france and speaking french is pronounced par ree but when we are in england and america and are speaking english we universally pronounce it par is it is so with almost all names of places they change the pronunciation and often the mode of spelling according to the analogy of the language used by the person speaking of them many persons suppose that in order correctly to pronounce the name of any place we must pronounce it as the people do who live in and around the place but this is not so the rule on the other hand is that we must pronounce it as the people do who live in and around the place the language of which we are speaking thus the people of france call their capital par ree those of spain call theirs something like this madhreedth the italians pronounce theirs roma but we in talking english say simply paris madrid and rome in other words when we are talking english we talk english throughout using english words for names of things and english pronunciation for names of places in all cases where there is an english pronunciation established as there is in respect to all the rivers towns mountains and other localities on the globe that are well known and often spoken of in the english world mont blanc is one of these like the word paris it has its french pronunciation for the french and its english pronunciation for the english and its english pronunciation is as if it were spelled mount blank or mont blank under this name it has been known and spoken of familiarly all over england and america for centuries and this it seems to me is the proper name to give it when we are speaking english its french pronunciation is very different it is one which none but a practical french scholar can possibly imitate except in a very awkward manner those who have visited france and switzerland and have been accustomed to the french sound often give the word the french pronunciation but it is not at all necessary to do so the word like paris has its own established english sound and if it is not pedantry to attempt to give it the french sound when speaking english it certainly is not a mispronunciation to give it the english one indeed to require the french pronunciation of the word from english speakers would be in effect to banish it almost altogether from conversation for among the ten millions more or less in england or america who speak english well there is probably not one in a thousand that can possibly give the word its true french pro

born be kind to my remains and o defend against your judgment your departed friend let not the insulting foe my fame pursue but shade those laurels which descend to you and take for tribute what these lines express you merit more nor could my love do less epistle to mr congreve i was then and have been ever since most sensibly touched with that expression and the more so because i could not find in myself the means of satisfying the passion which i felt in me to do something answerable to an injunction laid upon me in so pathetic and so amicable a manner you my lord have furnished me with ample means of acquitting myself both of my duty and obligation to my departed friend what kinder office lies in me to do to these his most valuable and imperishable remains than to commit them to the protection and lodge them under the roof of a patron whose hospitality has extended itself even to his dust if i would permit myself to run on in the way which so fairly opens itself before me i should tire your grace with reiterated praises and acknowledgments and i might possibly notwithstanding my pretended right so to do give some handle to such who are inclinable to censure to tax me of affectation and officiousness in thanking you more than comes to my share for doing a thing which is in truth of a public consideration as it is doing an honour to your country for so unquestionably it is to do honour to him who was an honour to it i have but one thing to say either to obviate or to answer such an objection if it shall be made to me which is that i loved mr dryden i have not touched upon any other public honour or bounty done by you to your country i have industriously declined entering upon a theme of so extensive a nature and of all your numerous and continual largesses to the public i have only singled out this as what most particularly affected me i confess freely to your grace i very much admire all those other donations but i much more love this and i cannot help it if i am naturally more delighted with any thing that is amiable than with any thing that is wonderful whoever shall censure me i dare be confident you my lord will excuse me for any thing that i shall say with due regard to a gentleman for whose person i had as just an affection as i have an admiration of his writings and indeed mr dryden had personal qualities to challenge both love and esteem from all who were truly acquainted with him he was of a nature exceedingly humane and compassionate easily forgiving injuries and capable of a prompt and sincere reconciliation with them who had offended him such a temperament is the only solid foundation of all moral virtues and sociable endowments his friendship where he professed it went much beyond his professions and i have been told of strong and generous instances of it by the persons themselves who received them though his hereditary income was little more than a bare competency as his reading had been very extensive so was he very happy in a memory tenacious of every thing that he had read he was not more possessed of knowledge than he was communicative of it but then his communication of it was by no means pedantic or imposed upon the conversation but just such and went so far as by the natural turns of the discourse in which he was engaged it was necessarily promoted or required he was extreme ready and gentle in his correction of the errors of any writer who thought fit to consult him and full as ready and patient to admit of the reprehension of others in respect of his own oversight or mistakes he was of very easy i may say of very pleasing access but something slow and as it were diffident in his advances to others he had something in his nature that abhorred intrusion into any society whatsoever indeed it is to be regretted that he was rather blameable in the other extreme for by that means he was personally less known and consequently his character might become liable both to misapprehensions and misrepresentations to the best of my knowledge and observation he was of all the men that ever i knew one of the most modest and the most easily to be discountenanced in his approaches either to his superiors or his equals i have given your grace this slight sketch of his personal character as well to vindicate his memory as to justify myself for the love which i bore to his person and i have the rather done it because i hope it may be acceptable to you to know that he was worthy of the distinction you have shewn him as a man as well as an author as to his writings i shall not take upon me to speak of them for to say little of them would not be to do them right and to say all that i ought to say would be to be very voluminous but i may venture to say in general terms that no man hath written in our language so much and so various matter and in so various manners so well another thing i may say very peculiar to him which is that his parts did not decline with his years but that he was an improving writer to his last even to near seventy years of age improving even in fire and imagination as well as in judgment witness his ode on st cecilia s day and his fables his latest performances he was equally excellent in verse and in prose his prose had all the clearness imaginable together with all the nobleness of expression all the graces and ornaments proper and peculiar to it without deviating into the language or diction of poetry i make this observation only to distinguish his style from that of many poetical writers who meaning to write har

the truth wife i should not wonder if some terrible thing were to happen to all the people in the village unless they mend their manners but as for you and me so long as providence affords us a crust of bread let us be ready to give half to any poor homeless stranger that may come along and need it that s right husband said baucis so we will these old folks you must know were quite poor and had to work pretty hard for a living old philemon toiled diligently in his garden while baucis was always busy with her distaff or making a little butter and cheese with their cow s milk or doing one thing and another about the cottage their food was seldom anything but bread milk and vegetables with sometimes a portion of honey from their beehive and now and then a bunch of grapes that had ripened against the cottage wall but they were two of the kindest old people in the world and would cheerfully have gone without their dinners any day rather than refuse a slice of their brown loaf a cup of new milk and a spoonful of honey to the weary traveller who might pause before their door they felt as if such guests had a sort of holiness and that they ought therefore to treat them better and more bountifully than their own selves their cottage stood on a rising ground at some short distance from a village which lay in a hollow valley that was about half a mile in breadth this valley in past ages when the world was new had probably been the bed of a lake there fishes had glided to and fro in the depths and water weeds had grown along the margin and trees and hills had seen their reflected images in the broad and peaceful mirror but as the waters subsided men had cultivated the soil and built houses on it so that it was now a fertile spot and bore no traces of the ancient lake except a very small brook which meandered through the midst of the village and supplied the inhabitants with water the valley had been dry land so long that oaks had sprung up and grown great and high and perished with old age and been succeeded by others as tall and stately as the first never was there a prettier or more fruitful valley the very sight of the plenty around them should have made the inhabitants kind and gentle and ready to show their gratitude to providence by doing good to their fellow creatures but we are sorry to say the people of this lovely village were not worthy to dwell in a spot on which heaven had smiled so beneficently they were a very selfish and hard hearted people and had no pity for the poor nor sympathy with the homeless they would only have laughed had anybody told them that human beings owe a debt of love to one another because there is no other method of paying the debt of love and care which all of us owe to providence you will hardly believe what i am going to tell you these naughty people taught their children to be no better than themselves and used to clap their hands by way of encouragement when they saw the little boys and girls run after some poor stranger shouting at his heels and pelting hum with stones they kept large and fierce dogs and whenever a traveller ventured to show himself in the village street this pack of disagreeable curs scampered to meet him barking snarling and showing their teeth then they would seize him by his leg or by his clothes just as it happened and if he were ragged when he came he was generally a pitiable object before he had time to run away this was a very terrible thing to poor travellers as you may suppose especially when they chanced to be sick or feeble or lame or old such persons if they once knew how badly these unkind people and their unkind children and curs were in the habit of behaving would go miles and miles out of their way rather than try to pass through the village again what made the matter seem worse if possible was that when rich persons came in their chariots or riding on beautiful horses with their servants in rich liveries attending on them nobody could be more civil and obsequious than the inhabitants of the village they would take off their hats and make the humblest bows you ever saw if the children were rude they were pretty certain to get their ears boxed and as for the dogs if a single cur in the pack presumed to yelp his master instantly beat him with a club and tied him up without any supper this would have been all very well only it proved that the villagers cared much about the money that a stranger had in his pocket and nothing whatever for the human soul which lives equally in the beggar and the prince so now you can understand why old philemon spoke so sorrowfully when he heard the shouts of the children and the barking of the dogs at the farther extremity of the village street there was a confused din which lasted a good while and seemed to pass quite through the breadth of the valley i never heard the dogs so loud observed the good old man nor the children so rude answered his good old wife they sat shaking their heads one to another while the noise came nearer and nearer until at the foot of the little eminence on which their cottage stood they saw two travellers approaching on foot close behind them came the fierce dogs snarling at their very heels a little farther off ran a crowd of children who sent up shrill cries and flung stones at the two strangers with all their might once or twice the younger of the two men he was a slender and very active figure turned about and drove back the dogs with a staff which he carried in his hand his companion who was a very tall person walked calmly

to trace how he became possessed of his black vizard which was anciently made in the resemblance of the face of a cat but it seems that the mask was essential to the performance of the character as will appear from the following theatrical anecdote an actor on the italian stage permitted at the foire du st germain in paris was renowned for the wild venturous and extravagant wit the brilliant sallies and fortunate repartees with which he prodigally seasoned the character of the party coloured jester some critics whose good will towards a favourite performer was stronger than their judgment took occasion to remonstrate with the successful actor on the subject of the grotesque vizard they went wilily to their purpose observing that his classical and attic wit his delicate vein of humour his happy turn for dialogue were rendered burlesque and ludicrous by this unmeaning and bizarre disguise and that those attributes would become far more impressive if aided by the spirit of his eye and the expression of his natural features the actor s vanity was easily so far engaged as to induce him to make the experiment he played harlequin barefaced but was considered on all hands as having made a total failure he had lost the audacity which a sense of incognito bestowed and with it all the reckless play of raillery which gave vivacity to his original acting he cursed his advisers and resumed his grotesque vizard but it is said without ever being able to regain the careless and successful levity which the consciousness of the disguise had formerly bestowed perhaps the author of waverley is now about to incur a risk of the same kind and endanger his popularity by having laid aside his incognito it is certainly not a voluntary experiment like that of harlequin for it was my original intention never to have avowed these works during my lifetime and the original manuscripts were carefully preserved though by the care of others rather than mine with the purpose of supplying the necessary evidence of the truth when the period of announcing it should arrive these manuscripts are at present august advertised for public sale which is an addition though a small one to other annoyances but the affairs of my publishers having unfortunately passed into a management different from their own i had no right any longer to rely upon secrecy in that quarter and thus my mask like my aunt dinah s in tristram shandy having begun to wax a little threadbare about the chin it became time to lay it aside with a good grace unless i desired it should fall in pieces from my face which was now become likely yet i had not the slightest intention of selecting the time and place in which the disclosure was finally made nor was there any concert betwixt my learned and respected friend lord meadowbank and myself upon that occasion it was as the reader is probably aware upon the rd february last at a public meeting called for establishing a professional theatrical fund in edinburgh that the communication took place just before we sat down to table lord meadowbank one of the supreme judges of scotland termed lords of council and session asked me privately whether i was still anxious to preserve my incognito on the subject of what were called the waverley novels i did not immediately see the purpose of his lordship s question although i certainly might have been led to infer it and replied that the secret had now of necessity become known to so many people that i was indifferent on the subject lord meadowbank was thus induced while doing me the great honour of proposing my health to the meeting to say something on the subject of these novels so strongly connecting them with me as the author that by remaining silent i must have stood convicted either of the actual paternity or of the still greater crime of being supposed willing to receive indirectly praise to which i had no just title i thus found myself suddenly and unexpectedly placed in the confessional and had only time to recollect that i had been guided thither by a most friendly hand and could not perhaps find a better public opportunity to lay down a disguise which began to resemble that of a detected masquerader i had therefore the task of avowing myself to the numerous and respectable company assembled as the sole and unaided author of these novels of waverley the paternity of which was likely at one time to have formed a controversy of some celebrity for the ingenuity with which some instructors of the public gave their assurance on the subject was extremely persevering i now think it further necessary to say that while i take on myself all the merits and demerits attending these compositions i am bound to acknowledge with gratitude hints of subjects and legends which i have received from various quarters and have occasionally used as a foundation of my fictitious compositions or woven up with them in the shape of episodes i am bound in particular to acknowledge

without the old maid in the winding sheet still years went on and still she followed funerals and was not yet summoned to her own festival of death one afternoon the great street of the town was all alive with business and bustle though the sun now gilded only the upper half of the church spire having left the housetops and loftiest trees in shadow the scene was cheerful and animated in spite of the sombre shade between the high brick buildings here were pompous merchants in white wigs and laced velvet the bronzed faces of sea captains the foreign garb and air of spanish creoles and the disdainful port of natives of old england all contrasted with the rough aspect of one or two hack settlers negotiating sales of timber from forests where axe had never sounded sometimes a lady passed swelling roundly forth in an embroidered petticoat balancing her steps in high heeled shoes and courtesying with lofty grace to the punctilious obeisances of the gentlemen the life of the town seemed to have its very centre not far from an old mansion that stood somewhat back from the pavement surrounded by neglected grass with a strange air of loneliness rather deepened than dispelled by the throng so near it its site would have been suitably occupied by a magnificent exchange or a brick block lettered all over with various signs or the large house itself might have made a noble tavern with the king s arms swinging before it and guests in every chamber instead of the present solitude but owing to some dispute about the right of inheritance the mansion had been long without a tenant decaying from year to year and throwing the stately gloom of its shadow over the busiest part of the town such was the scene and such the time when a figure unlike any that have been described was observed at a distance down the street i espy a strange sail yonder remarked a liverpool captain that woman in the long white garment the sailor seemed much struck by the object as were several others who at the same moment caught a glimpse of the figure that had attracted his notice almost immediately the various topics of conversation gave place to speculations in an undertone on this unwonted occurrence can there be a funeral so late this afternoon inquired some they looked for the signs of death at every door the sexton the hearse the assemblage of black clad relatives all that makes up the woeful pomp of funerals they raised their eyes also to the sun gilt spire of the church and wondered that no clang proceeded from its bell which had always tolled till now when this figure appeared in the light of day but none had heard that a corpse was to be borne to its home that afternoon nor was there any token of a funeral except the apparition of the old maid in the winding sheet what may this portend asked each man of his neighbor all smiled as they put the question yet with a certain trouble in their eyes as if pestilence or some other wide calamity were prognosticated by the untimely intrusion among the living of one whose presence had always been associated with death and woe what a comet is to the earth was that sad woman to the town still she moved on while the hum of surprise was hushed at her approach and the proud and the humble stood aside that her white garment might not wave against them it was a long loose robe of spotless purity its wearer appeared very old pale emaciated and feeble yet glided onward without the unsteady pace of extreme age at one point of her course a littly rosy boy burst forth from a door and ran with open arms towards the ghostly woman seeming to expect a kiss from her bloodless lips she made a slight pause fixing her eye upon him with an expression of no earthly sweetness so that the child shivered and stood awe struck rather than affrighted while the old maid passed on perhaps her garment might have been polluted even by an infant s touch perhaps her kiss would have been death to the sweet boy within a year she is but a shadow whispered the superstitious the child put forth his arms and could not grasp her robe the wonder was increased when the old maid passed beneath the porch of the deserted mansion ascended the moss covered steps lifted the iron knocker and gave three raps the people could only conjecture that some old remembrance troubling her bewildered brain had impelled the poor woman hither to visit the friends of her youth all gone from their home long since and forever unless their ghosts still haunted it fit company for the old maid in the winding sheet an elderly man approached the steps and reverently uncovering his gray locks essayed to explain the matter none madam said he have dwelt in this house these fifteen years agone no not since the death of old colonel fenwicke whose funeral you may remember to have followed his heirs being ill agreed among themselves have let the mansion house go to ruin the old maid looked slowly round with a slight gesture of one hand and a finger of the other upon her lip appearing more shadow like than ever in the obscurity of the porch but again she lifted the hammer and gave this time a single rap could it be that a footstep was now heard coming down the staircase of the old mansion which all conceived to have been so long untenanted slowly feebly yet heavily like the pace of an aged and infirm person the step approached more distinct

emerged from the wood they found themselves on the brow of the hill a small down over which venetia ran exulting in the healthy breeze which at this exposed height was strong and fresh as they advanced to the opposite declivity to that which they had ascended a wide and peculiar landscape opened before them the extreme distance was formed by an undulating ridge of lofty and savage hills nearer than these were gentler elevations partially wooded and at their base was a rich valley its green meads fed by a clear and rapid stream which glittered in the sun as it coursed on losing itself at length in a wild and sedgy lake that formed the furthest limit of a widely spreading park in the centre of this park and not very remote from the banks of the rivulet was an ancient gothic building that had once been an abbey of great repute and wealth and had not much suffered in its external character by having served for nearly two centuries and a half as the principal dwelling of an old baronial family descending the downy hill that here and there was studded with fine old trees enriching by their presence the view from the abbey lady annabel and her party entered the meads and skirting the lake approached the venerable walls without crossing the stream it was difficult to conceive a scene more silent and more desolate there was no sign of life and not a sound save the occasional cawing of a rook advancing towards the abbey they passed a pile of buildings that in the summer might be screened from sight by the foliage of a group of elms too scanty at present to veil their desolation wide gaps in the roof proved that the vast and dreary stables were no longer used there were empty granaries whose doors had fallen from their hinges the gate of the courtyard was prostrate on the ground and the silent clock that once adorned the cupola over the noble entrance arch had long lost its index even the litter of the yard appeared dusty and grey with age you felt sure no human foot could have disturbed it for years at the back of these buildings were nailed the trophies of the gamekeeper hundreds of wild cats dried to blackness stretched their downward heads

they could prevail nothing they are all gone and vanished but this book from time to time hath remained and will remain unremoved in full and ample manner as it was written at the first a proof worthy of the manly mind of luther and compared with which the grotian pretended demonstrations from grotius himself to paley are mischievous underminings of the faith pleadings fitter for an old bailey thieves counsellor than for a christian divine the true evidence of the bible is the bible of christianity the living fact of christianity itself as the manifest archeus or predominant of the life of the planet ib p the art of the school divines said luther with their speculations in the holy scriptures are merely vain and human cogitations spun out of their own natural wit and understanding they talk much of the union of the will and understanding but all is mere fantasy and fondness the right and true speculation said luther is this believe in christ do what thou oughtest to do in thy vocation c this is the only practice in divinity also mystica theologia dionysii is a mere fable and a lie like to plato s fables omnia sunt non ens et omnia sunt ens all is something and all is nothing and so he leaveth all hanging in frivolous and idle sort still however du theure mann gottes mein verehrter luther reason will understanding are words to which real entities correspond and we may in a sound and good sense say that reason is the ray the projected disk or image from the sun of righteousness an echo from the eternal word the light that lighteth every man that cometh into the world and that when the will placeth itself in a right line with the reason there ariseth the spirit through which the will of god floweth into and actuates the will of man so that it willeth the things of god and the understanding is enlivened and thenceforward useth the materials supplied to it by the senses symbolically that is with an insight into the true substance thereof ib p the pope usurpeth and taketh to himself the power to expound and to construe the scriptures according to his pleasure what he saith must stand and be spoken as from heaven therefore let us love and preciously value the divine word that thereby we may be able to resist the devil and his swarm as often as i use in prayer the th verse of the st psalm in our prayer book version my thoughts especially revert to the subject of the right appreciation of the scriptures and in what sense the bible may be called the word of god and how and under what conditions the unity of the spirit is translucent through the letter which read as the letter merely is the word of this and that pious but fallible and imperfect man alas for the superstition where the words themselves are made to be the spirit o might i live but to utter all my meditations on this most concerning point ib p bullinger said once in my hearing said luther that he was earnest against the anabaptists as contemners of god s word and also against those which attributed too much to the literal word for said he such do sin against god and his almighty power as the jews did in naming the ark god but said he whoso holdeth a mean between both the same is taught what is the right use of the word and sacraments whereupon said luther i answered him and said bullinger you err you know neither yourself nor what you hold i mark well your tricks and fallacies zuinglius and oecolampadius likewise proceeded too far in the ungodly meaning but when brentius withstood them they then lessened their opinions alleging they did not reject the literal word but only condemned certain gross abuses by this your error you cut in sunder and separate the word and the spirit c in my present state of mind and with what light i now enjoy may god increase it and cleanse it from the dark mist into the lumen siccum of sincere knowledge i cannot persuade myself that this vehemence of our dear man of god against bullinger zuinglius and oecolampadius on this point could have had other origin than his misconception of what they intended but luther spoke often i like him and love him all the better therefor in his moods and according to the mood was not that a different mood in which he called st james s epistle a jack straw poppet and even in this work selects one verse as the best in the whole letter evidently meaning the only verse of any great value besides he accustomed himself to use the term the word in a very wide sense when the narrower would have cramped him when he was on the point of rejecting the apocalypse then the word meant the spirit of the scriptures collectively ib p i said luther do not hold that children are without faith when they are baptized for inasmuch as they are brought to christ by his command and that the church prayeth for them therefore without all doubt faith is given unto them although with our natural sense and reason we neither see nor understand it nay but dear honoured luther is this fair if christ or scripture had

of foam in her wake as she headed for the coral island before referred to the outer reef or barrier of coral which guarded the island was soon reached the narrow opening in this natural bulwark was passed the schooner stood across the belt of perfectly still water that lay between the reef and the shore and entered a small bay where the calm water reflected the strip of white sand green palms and tropical plants that skirted its margin as well as the purple hills of the interior here she swept round in a sudden but graceful curve until all her canvas fluttered in the breeze and then dropt anchor in about six fathoms water chapter two bumpus is fiery and philosophical murderous designs frustrated the captain of the schooner whose deep voice had so suddenly terminated the meditations of john bumpus was one of those men who seem to have been formed for the special purpose of leading and commanding their fellows he was not only unusually tall and powerful physical qualities which in themselves are by no means sufficient to command respect but as we have said he possessed a deep full toned bass voice in which there seemed to lie a species of fascination for its softest tones riveted attention and when it thundered forth commands in the fiercest storms it inspired confidence and a feeling of security in all who heard it the countenance of the captain however was that which induced men to accord to him a position of superiority in whatever sphere of action he chanced to move it was not so much a handsome as a manly and singularly grave face in every line of which was written inflexible determination his hair was short black and curly a small moustache darkened his upper lip but the rest of his face was closely shaven so that his large chin and iron jaw were fully displayed his eyes were of that indescribable blue colour which can exhibit the intensest passion or the most melting tenderness he wore a sombre but somewhat picturesque costume a dark coloured flannel shirt and trousers which latter were gathered in close round his lower limbs by a species of drab gaiter that appeared somewhat incongruous with the profession of the man the only bit of bright colour about him was a scarlet belt round his waist from the side of which depended a long knife in a brown leather sheath a pair of light shoes and a small round cap resembling what is styled in these days a pork pie completed his costume he was about forty years of age such was the commander or captain or skipper of this suspicious looking schooner a man pre eminently fitted for the accomplishment of much good or the perpetration of great evil as soon as the anchor touched the ground the captain ordered a small boat to be lowered and leaping into it with two men one of whom was

as he continued why capting wot do you mean to do with me then for i m a heavy piece of goods d ye see and can t be easily moved about without a small touch o my own consent you know jo bumpus as he was fond of styling himself said this with a serio comic air of sarcasm for he was an exception to the general rule of his fellows he had little respect for and no fear of his commander indeed to say truth for truth must be told even though the character of our rugged friend should suffer jo entertained a most profound belief in the immense advantage of muscular strength and vigour in general and of his own prowess in particular although not quite so gigantic a man as his captain he was nearly so and being a bold self reliant fellow he felt persuaded in his own mind that he could thrash him if need were in fact jo was convinced that there was no living creature under the sun human or otherwise that walked upon two legs that he could not pommel to death with more or less ease by means of his fists alone and in this conviction he was not far wrong yet it must not be supposed that jo bumpus was a boastful man or a bully far from it he was so thoroughly persuaded of his invincibility that he felt there was no occasion to prove it he therefore followed the natural bent of his inclinations which led him at all times to exhibit a mild amiable and gentle aspect except of course when he was roused as occasion for being roused was not wanting in the south seas in those days jo s amiability was frequently put to the test he sojourned while there in a condition of alternate calm and storm but riotous joviality ran like a rich vein through all his chequered life and lit up its most sombre phases like gleams of light on an april day you entered my service with your own consent replied the captain to jo s last remark and you may leave it with the same consent whenever you choose but you will please to remember that i did not engage you to serve on board the schooner back there you

literature which he has done much to render famous through the world and of which he has been for many years as i hope and believe he will be for many more a most brilliant and distinguished ornament who can revert to the literature of the land of scott and of burns without having directly in his mind as inseparable from the subject and foremost in the picture that old man of might with his lion heart and sceptred crutch christopher north i am glad to remember the time when i believed him to be a real actual veritable old gentleman that might be seen any day hobbling along the high street with the most brilliant eye but that is no fiction and the greyest hair in all the world who wrote not because he cared to write not because he cared for the wonder and admiration of his fellow men but who wrote because he could not help it because there was always springing up in his mind a clear and sparkling stream of poetry which must have vent and like the glittering fountain in the fairy tale draw what you might was ever at the full and never languished even by a single drop or bubble i had so figured him in my mind and when i saw the professor two days ago striding along the parliament house i was disposed to take it as a personal offence i was vexed to see him look so hearty i drooped to see twenty christophers in one i began to think that scottish life was all light and no shadows and i began to doubt that beautiful book to which i have turned again and again always to find new beauties and fresh sources of interest in proposing the memory of the late sir david wilkie mr dickens said less fortunate than the two gentlemen who have preceded me it is confided to me to mention a name which cannot be pronounced without sorrow a name in which scotland had a great triumph and which england delighted to honour one of the gifted of the earth has passed away as it were yesterday one who was devoted to his art and his art was nature i mean david wilkie he was one who made the cottage hearth a graceful thing of whom it might truly be said that he found books in the running brooks and who has left in all he did some breathing of the air which stirs the heather but however desirous to enlarge on his genius as an artist i would rather speak of him now as a friend who has gone from amongst us there is his deserted studio the empty easel lying idly by the unfinished picture with its face turned to the wall and there is that bereaved sister who loved him with an affection which death cannot quench he has left a name in fame clear as the bright sky he has filled our minds with memories pure as the blue waves which roll over him let us hope that she who more than all others mourns his loss may learn to reflect that he died in the fulness of his time

britannia with a service of plate on behalf of the passengers mr dickens addressed him as follows captain hewett i am very proud and happy to have been selected as the instrument of conveying to you

upon the ocean for a long time to come in all time to come and in all your voyages upon the sea i hope you will have a thought for those who wish to live in your memory by the help of these trifles as they will often connect you with the pleasure of those homes and fire sides from which they once wandered and which but for you they might never have regained so they trust that you will sometimes associate them with your hours of festive enjoyment and that when you drink from these cups you will feel that the draught is commended to your lips by friends whose best wishes you have and who

week aright they need it indeed and such a man before he shuts himself up and begins to examine himself would do well to examine himself as to why he is going to examine himself and to ask why am i going to do this because it is my interest because i think i shall gain more safety for my soul because i hope it will give me more chance of pleasure and glory in the next world but if so have i the mind of christ for he did not think of his own interest his own gain his own pleasure his own glory how is this then i confess that the root of all my faults is selfishness shall i examine into my own selfishness for a selfish end to get safety and pleasure by it hereafter i confess that the very glory of christ is that there is no selfishness in him shall i think over the sufferings of the unselfish christ for a selfish end to get something by it after i die i am too apt already to make myself the centre round which all the world must turn to care for everything only as far as it does me good or harm shall i make myself the centre round which heaven is to turn shall i think of god and of christ only as far as it will profit me and this week too of all weeks in the year god forgive me into what a contradiction i am running unawares no if i do shut myself up from my fellowmen it shall be only to think how i may do my duty better to my fellowmen if i do think over christ s sufferings it shall be only that i may learn from him how to suffer if need be at the call of duty at least to stir up in me obedience usefulness generosity that i may go back to my work cheerfully willingly careless what reward i get provided only i can do good in my station but after all will not the text tell us best how to keep passion week will not our lord s own example tell us can we go wrong if we keep our passion week as christ kept his and how did he keep it certainly not by shutting himself up apart certainly not by mere thinking over the glory of self sacrifice he taught daily we read in the temple instead of giving up his work for a while he seems to have worked more earnestly than ever as the terrible end drew near and his soul was troubled and he was straitened as he looked forward to his baptism of fire and the struggle in him grew fiercer for the bible tells us that there was a struggle between the man s natural desire to save his life and the god s heavenly desire to lay down his life he threw himself more and more into the work which he had to do we hear more perhaps of our lord s saying and doings during this week up to the very moment before he was betrayed to death than we do of the whole three years of his public life his teaching was never it seems so continual his appeals to the nation which he was trying to save were never so pathetic as at the very last his warnings to the bigots who were destroying his nation never so terrible his contempt for personal danger never so clear the bible seems to picture him to us as gathering up all his strength for one last effort if by any means he might save that doomed city of jerusalem and in his divine spirit courting death the more the more his human flesh shrank from it this the pattern of perfect obedience perfect unselfishness perfect generosity perfect self sacrificing love is what we are to look at in passion week this i believe is what we are meant to copy in passion week that we may learn the habit of copying it all our lives long why should not we then keep passion week somewhat as our lord kept it before us not by merely hiding in our closets to meditate even about him but by going about our work each in his place dutifully bravely as he went by doing the duty which lies nearest us and trying to draw our lesson out of it thus we may keep passion week in spirit and in truth though some of us may hardly have time to enter a church hardly have time for an hour s private thought about religion amid the bustle of daily duties amid the buzz of petty cares amid the anxieties of great labours amid the roar of the busy world which cannot stop and which ought not to stop for our convenience we may keep passion week in spirit and in truth if we will do the duty which lies nearest us and try to draw our lesson out of it for practice and i believe practice alone will teach us to restrain ourselves and conquer ourselves experience and i believe experience alone will show us our own faults and weaknesses every man every human spirit on god s earth has spiritual enemies habits and principles within him if not other spirits without him which hinder him more or less from being all that god meant him to be and we must find out those enemies and measure their strength not merely by reading of them in books not merely by fancying them in our own minds but by the hard blows and sudden falls which they too often give us in the actual battle of daily life and how can we find them out this at least we can do we can ask ourselves at every turn for what end am i doing this and this for what end am i living at all for myself or for others am i living for ambition for fame for show for money for pleasure if so i have not the mind of christ i have not found

not to disperse them meantime the purpose of the governor in disturbing the peace of the town at a period when the slightest commotion might throw the country into a ferment was almost the universal

the governor s object somewhat less atrocious his predecessor under the old charter bradstreet a venerable companion of the first settlers was known to be in town there were grounds for conjecturing that sir edmund andros intended at once to strike terror by a parade of military force and to confound the opposite faction by possessing himself of their chief stand firm for the old charter governor

their appearance occupying the whole breadth of the passage with shouldered matchlocks and matches burning so as to present a row of fires in the dusk their steady march was like the progress of a machine that would roll irresistibly over everything in its way next moving slowly with a confused clatter of hoofs on the pavement rode a party of mounted gentlemen the central figure being sir

oppressors of his native land the captain of a frigate in the harbor and two or three civil officers under the crown were also there but the figure which most attracted the public eye and stirred up the deepest feeling was the episcopal clergyman of king s chapel riding haughtily among the magistrates in his priestly vestments the fitting representative of prelacy and persecution the union of church and state and all those abominations which had driven the puritans to the wilderness another guard of soldiers in double rank brought up the rear the whole scene was a picture of the condition of new england and its moral the deformity of any government that does not grow out of the nature of things and the character of the people on one side the religious multitude with their sad visages and dark attire and on the other the group of despotic rulers with the high churchman in the midst and here and there a crucifix at their bosoms all magnificently clad flushed with wine proud of unjust authority and scoffing at the universal groan and the mercenary soldiers waiting but the word to deluge the street with blood showed the only means by which obedience could be secured o lord of hosts cried a voice among the crowd provide a champion for thy people this ejaculation was loudly uttered and served as a herald s cry to introduce a remarkable personage the crowd had rolled back and were now huddled together nearly at the extremity of the street while the soldiers had advanced no more than a third of its length the intervening space was empty a paved solitude between lofty edifices which threw almost a twilight shadow over it suddenly there was seen the figure of an ancient man who seemed to have emerged from among the people and was walking by himself along the centre of the street to confront the armed band he wore the old puritan dress a dark cloak and a steeple crowned hat in the fashion of at least fifty years before with a heavy sword upon his thigh but a

the member which has perhaps attracted least attention up to the present time is that which treats of the geology of south america the actual writing of this book appears to have occupied darwin a shorter period than either of the other volumes of the series his diary records that the work was accomplished within ten months namely between july and april but the book was not actually issued till late in the year following the preface bearing the date september altogether as darwin informs us in his autobiography the geological books consumed four and a half years steady work most of the remainder of the ten years that elapsed between the return of the beagle and the completion of his geological books being it is sad to relate lost through illness concerning the geological observations on south america darwin wrote to his friend lyell as follows my volume will be about pages dreadfully dull yet much condensed i think whenever you have time to look through it you will think the collection of facts on the elevation of the land and on the formation of terraces pretty good much condensed is the verdict that everyone must endorse on rising from the perusal of this remarkable book but by no means dull the three and a half years from april to september were spent by darwin in south america and were devoted to continuous scientific work the problems he dealt with were either purely geological or those which constitute the borderland between the geological and biological sciences it is impossible to read the journal which he kept during this time without being impressed by the conviction that it contains all the germs of thought which afterwards developed into the origin of species but it is equally evident that after his return to england biological speculations gradually began to exercise a more exclusive sway over darwin s mind and tended to dispossess geology which during the actual period of the voyage certainly engrossed most of his time and attention the wonderful series of observations made during those three and a half years in south america could scarcely be done justice to in the pages devoted to their exposition that he executed the work of preparing the book on south america in somewhat the manner of a task is shown by many references in his letters writing to sir joseph hooker in he says i hope this next summer to finish my south american geology then to get out a little zoology and hurrah for my species work it would seem that the feeling of disappointment which darwin so often experienced in comparing a book when completed with the observations and speculations which had inspired it was more keenly felt in the case of his volume on south america than any other to one friend he writes i have of late been slaving extra hard to the great discomfiture of wretched digestive organs at south america and thank all the fates i have done three fourths of it writing plain english grows with me more and more difficult and never attainable as for your pretending that you will read anything so dull as my pure geological descriptions lay not such a flattering unction on my soul for it is incredible to

unearthly shout close at hand then died away by slow gradations as if the accursed being that uttered it had withdrawn over the verge of the world whence it had come but the man felt that this was not so that it was near by and had not moved a strange sensation began slowly to take possession of his body and his mind he could not have said which if any of his senses was affected he felt it rather as a consciousness a mysterious mental assurance of some overpowering presence some supernatural malevolence different in kind from the invisible existences that swarmed about him and superior to them in power he knew that it had uttered that hideous laugh and now it seemed to be approaching him from what direction he did not know dared not conjecture all his former fears were forgotten or merged

to his will his arms fell to his sides the book to the earth and powerless to move or cry out he found himself staring into the sharply drawn face and blank dead eyes of his own mother standing white

survived the wreck wrought by civil war their children had the social and educational opportunities of their time and place and had responded to good associations and instruction with agreeable manners and cultivated minds halpin being the youngest and not over robust was perhaps a trifle spoiled he had the double disadvantage of a mother s assiduity and a father s neglect frayser pere was what no southern man of means is not a politician his country or rather his section and state made demands upon his time and attention so exacting that to those of his family he was compelled to turn an ear partly deafened by the thunder of the political captains and the shouting his own included young halpin was of a dreamy indolent and rather romantic turn somewhat more addicted to literature than law the profession to which he was bred among those of his relations who professed the modern faith of heredity it was well understood that in him the character of the late myron bayne a maternal great grandfather had revisited the glimpses of the moon by which orb bayne had in his lifetime been sufficiently affected to be a poet of no small colonial distinction if not specially observed it was observable that while a frayser who was not the proud possessor of a sumptuous copy of the ancestral poetical works printed at the family expense and long ago withdrawn from an inhospitable market was a rare frayser indeed there was an illogical indisposition to honor the great deceased in the person of his spiritual successor halpin was pretty generally deprecated as an intellectual black sheep who was likely at any moment to disgrace the flock by bleating in meter the tennessee fraysers were a practical folk not practical in the popular sense of devotion to sordid pursuits but having a robust contempt for any qualities unfitting a man for the wholesome vocation of politics in justice to young halpin it should be said that while in him were pretty faithfully reproduced most of the mental and moral characteristics ascribed by history and family tradition to the famous colonial bard his succession to the gift and faculty divine was purely inferential not only had he never been known to court the muse but in truth he could not have written correctly a line of verse to save himself from the killer of the wise still there was no knowing when the dormant faculty might wake and smite the lyre in

going up to him somewhat sulkily the man looked at me gravely through the smoke of his pipe and said you re in a passion my young buck that s all and in case you didn t know it i thought i d tell ye i burst into a fit of laughter well i believe you re not far wrong but i m better now ah that s right said the sailor with an approving nod of his head always confess when you re in the wrong now younker let me give you a bit of advice never get into a passion if you can help it and if you can t help it get out of it as fast as possible and if you can t get out of it just give a great roar to let off the steam and turn about and run there s nothing like that passion han t got legs it can t hold on to a feller when he s runnin if you keep it up till you a most split your timbers passion has no chance it must go a starn now lad i ve been watchin ye all the mornin and i see there s a screw loose somewhere if you ll tell me wot it is see if i don t help you the kind frank way in which this was said quite won my heart so i sat down on the old cask and told the sailor all my sorrows boy said he when i had finished i ll put you in the way o helpin your mother i can get you a berth in my ship if you re willin to take a trip to the whale fishery of the south seas and who will look after my mother when i m away said i the sailor looked perplexed at the question ah that s a puzzler he replied knocking the ashes out of his pipe will you take me to your mother s house lad willingly said i and jumping up i led the way as we turned to go i observed that the old gentleman with the gold headed cane was leaning over the rail of the pier at a short distance from us a feeling of anger instantly rose within me and i exclaimed loud enough for him to hear i do believe that stingy old chap has been listening to every word we ve been saying i thought i observed a frown on the sailor s brow as i said this but he made no remark and in a few minutes we were walking rapidly through the streets my companion stopped at one of those stores so common in seaport towns where one can buy almost anything from a tallow candle to a brass cannon here he purchased a pound of tea a pound of sugar a pound of butter and a small loaf all of which he thrust into the huge pockets of his coat he had evidently no idea of proportion or of household affairs it was a simple easy way of settling the matter to get a pound of everything in a short time we reached our house a very old one in a poor neighbourhood and entered my mother s room she was sitting at the table when we went in with a large bible before her and a pair of horn spectacles on her nose i could see that she had been out gathering coals and cinders during my absence for a good fire burned in the grate and the kettle was singing cheerily thereon i ve brought a friend to see you mother said i good day mistress said the sailor bluntly sitting down on a stool near the fire you seem to be goin to have your tea i expect to have it soon replied my mother indeed said i in surprise have you anything in the kettle nothing but water my son has anybody brought you anything then since i went out nobody why then mistress broke in the seaman how can you expect to have your tea so soon my mother took off her spectacles looked calmly in the man s face laid her hand on the bible and said because i have been a widow woman these three years and never once in all that time have i gone a single day without a meal when the usual hour came i put on my kettle to boil for this word tells me that the lord will provide i expect my tea to night the sailor s face expressed puzzled astonishment at these words and he continued to regard my mother with a look of wonder as he drew forth his supplies of food and laid them on the table in a short time we were all enjoying a cup of tea and talking about the whale fishery and the difficulty of my going away while my mother was dependent on me at last the sailor rose to leave us taking a five pound note from his pocket he laid it on the table and said mistress this is all i have in the world but i ve got neither family nor friends and i m bound for the south seas in six days so if you ll take it you re welcome to it and if your son bob can manage to cast loose from you without leaving you to sink i ll take him aboard the ship that i sail in he ll always find me at the bull and griffin in the high street or at the end o the pier while the sailor was speaking i observed a figure standing in a dark corner of the room near the door and on looking more closely i found that it was the old gentleman with the nose like his cane knob seeing that he was observed he came forward and said i trust that you will forgive my coming here without invitation but i happened to overhear part of the conversation between your son and this seaman and i am willing to help you over your little difficulty if you will allow me the old gentleman said this in a very quick abrupt way and looked as if he were afraid his offer might be refused he was much heated with climbing our long stair no doubt and as he stood in the middle of the room puffing and wiping his bald head with a handkerchief my mother rose hastily and offered him a chair you are very kind sir she said do sit down sir i m sure i don t know why you should take so much trouble but dear me you are very warm will

chinese protection of american ships against such outrages art the united states of america and his majesty the emperor of china believing that the safety and prosperity of commerce will thereby best be promoted agree that any privilege or immunity in respect to trade or navigation within the chinese dominions which may not have been stipulated for by treaty shall be subject to the discretion of the chinese government and may be regulated by it accordingly but not in a manner or spirit incompatible with the treaty stipulations of the parties at a first glance this clause would seem unnecessary unnecessary because the granting of any privilege not stipulated in a treaty with china must of course be a matter entirely subject to the pleasure of the chinese government yet the clause has its significance there is in china a class of foreigners who demand privileges concessions and immunities instead of asking for them a class who look upon the chinese as degraded barbarians and not entitled to charity as helpless and therefore to be trodden underfoot a tyrannical class who say openly that the chinese should be forced to do thus and so that foreigners know what is best for them better than they do themselves and therefore it would be but a christian kindness to take them by the throat and compel them to see their real interests as the enlightened foreigners see them these people harass and distress the government by constantly dictating to it and meddling with its affairs they beget and keep alive a distrust of foreigners among the chinese people it will surprise many among us to know that the chinese are eminently hospitable by nature toward strangers it will surprise many whose notion of chinamen is that they are a race who formerly manifested their interest in shipwrecked strangers by exhibiting them in iron cages in public in a half starved condition as rare and curious monsters to know that a few hundred years ago they welcomed adventurous jesuit priests who struggled to their shores with great cordiality and gave to them the fullest liberty in the dissemination of their doctrines i have seen at st peter s in rome a picture of certain restive chinamen barbecuing some romish priests this was an uncalled for stretch of hospitality if it be proposed to call it hospitality at all but the caging and barbecuing of strangers were disagreeable attentions which were secured to those strangers by their predecessors as i have said the chinese were exceedingly hospitable and kind toward the first foreigners who came among them or years ago they listened to their preachings they joined their church they saw the doctrines of christianity spreading far and wide over the land yet nobody murmured against these things the jesuit priests were elevated to high offices in the government china s confidence in the foreigners was not betrayed in time had the jesuits been let alone they would have completely christianized china no doubt that is they would have made of the chinese christians according to their moral physical and intellectual strength and then given nature a few generations in which to shed the pagan skin and sap the pagan blood and so perfect the work for be it known one jesuit missionary is equal to an army of any other denomination where there is actual work to be done and solid unsentimental wisdom to be exercised however to pursue my narrative some priests of the dominican order arrived and very shortly began to make trouble they began to cramp the privileges of converts they flouted the system of persuasion of the jesuits and adopted that of driving they meddled in politics they became arrogant and dictatorial they fomented discords everywhere in a word they utterly destroyed chinese confidence in foreigners and raised up chinese hatred and distrust against them for these things they were driven out of the country when strangers came after that the chinese with that calm wisdom which comes only through bitter experience caged them or hanged them i spoke a while ago of a domineering hectoring class of foreigners in china who are always interfering with the government s business and thus keeping alive the distrust and dislike engendered by their kindred spirits the dominicans an age ago they clog progress article of the treaty is intended to discountenance all officious intermeddling with the government s business by americans and so move a step toward the restoration of that chinese confidence in strangers which was annihilated so long ago art the emperor of china shall have the right to appoint consuls at ports of the united states who shall enjoy the same privileges and immunities as those which are enjoyed by public law and treaty in the united states by the consuls of great britain and russia or either of them and soon perhaps within a year or two there will doubtless be a chinese envoy located permanently at washington the consuls referred to above will be appointed with all convenient dispatch they will be americans but will in all cases be men who are capable of feeling pity for persecuted chinamen and will call to a strict account all who wrong them it affords me infinite satisfaction to call particular attention to this consul clause and think of the howl that will go up from the cooks the railroad graders and the cobble stone artists of

barking of a mad walrus was music to the roaring of his wrath every one except his mother wished him dead and buried in the centre of an iceberg or at the bottom of the polar sea his mother squat solid pleasant faced and mild alone put up with his ways with that long suffering endurance which is characteristic of mothers nothing could disturb the serenity of toolooha when the young giant that was to be roared she fondled him if that was ineffectual she gave him a walrus tusk or a seal s flipper to play with if that did not suffice she handed him a lump of blubber to suck if that failed as was sometimes the case she gambolled with him on the floor of her snow hut and rubbed his oily visage lovingly over her not less oleaginous countenance need we enlarge on this point have not all mothers acted thus or similarly in all times and climes from pole to pole a mother s soul is tender strong and true whether the loved be good or bad white yellow black or blue but toolooha s love was wise as well as strong if all else failed she was wont to apply corporal punishment and whacked her baby with her tail be not shocked reader we refer to the tail of her coat which was so long that it trailed on the ground and had a flap at the end which produced surprising results when properly applied but the howling condition of life did not last long at the age of five years little chingatok began to grow unusually fast and when he reached the age of seven the tribe took note of him as a more than promising youth then the grand spirit which had hitherto sought to vent itself in yells and murderous assaults on its doting mother spent its energies in more noble action all the little boys of his size although much older than himself began to look up to him as a champion none went so boldly into mimic warfare with the walrus and the bear as chingatok no one could make toy sledges out of inferior and scanty materials so well as he if any little one wanted a succourer in distress skreekinbroot was the lad to whom he or she turned if a broken toy had to be mended chingatok could do it better than any other boy and so it went on until he became a man and a giant when he was merely a big boy that is bigger than the largest man of his tribe he went out with the other braves to hunt and fish and signalised himself by the reckless manner in which he would attack the polar bear single handed but when he reached his full height and breadth he gave up reckless acts restrained his tendency to display his great strength and became unusually modest and thoughtful even pensive for an eskimo the superiority of chingatok s mind as well as his body soon became manifest even among savages intellectual power commands respect when coupled with physical force it elicits reverence the young giant soon became an oracle and a leading man in his tribe those who had wished him dead and in the centre of an iceberg or at the bottom of the polar sea came to wish that there were only a few more men like him of course he had one or two enemies who has not there were a few who envied him his physical powers there were some who envied him his moral influence none envied him his intellectual superiority for they did not understand it there was one who not only envied but hated him this was eemerk a mean spirited narrow minded fellow who could not bear to play what is styled second fiddle eemerk was big enough over six feet but he wanted to be bigger he was stout enough but wanted to be stouter he was influential too but wanted to reign supreme this of course was not possible while there existed a taller stouter and cleverer man than himself even if eemerk had been the equal of chingatok in all these respects there would still have remained one difference of character which would have rendered equality impossible it was this our young giant was unselfish and modest eemerk was selfish and vain glorious when the latter killed a seal he always kept the tit bits for himself chingatok gave them to his mother or to any one else who had a mind to have them and so in regard to everything chingatok was not a native of the region in which we introduce him to the reader he and the tribe or rather part of the tribe to which he belonged had travelled from the far north so far north that nobody knew the name of the land from which they had come even chingatok himself did not know it being unacquainted with geography he knew no more about his position on the face of this globe than a field mouse or a sparrow but the young giant had heard a strange rumour while in his far off country which had caused his strong intellect to ponder and his huge heart to beat high tribes who dwelt far to the south of his northern home had told him that other tribes still further south had declared that the people who dwelt to the south of them had met with a race of men who came to them over the sea on floating islands that these islands had something like trees growing out of them and wings which moved about which folded and expanded somewhat like the wings of the sea gull that these men s faces were whiter than eskimo faces that they wore skins of a much more curious kind than sealskins and that they were amazingly clever with their hands talked a language that no one could understand and did many wonderful things that nobody could comprehend a longing wistful expression used to steal over chingatok s face as he gazed at the southern horizon while listening to these strange rumours and a very slight smile of incredulity had glimmered on his visage when it was told him that one of the floating islands of these kablunets or white men had been seen with a burning mountain in the middle of it which vomited forth smoke and fire an

himself just beside the placard when producing a small slate and tracing some words upon if he held it up before him on a level with the placard so that they who read the one might read the other the words were these charity thinketh no evil as in gaining his place some little perseverance not to say persistence of a mildly inoffensive sort had been unavoidable it was not with the best relish that the crowd regarded his apparent intrusion and upon a more attentive survey perceiving no badge of authority about him but rather something quite the contrary he being of an aspect so singularly innocent an aspect too which they took to be somehow inappropriate to the time and place and inclining to the notion that his writing was of much the same sort in short taking him for some strange kind of simpleton harmless enough would he keep to himself but not wholly unobnoxious as an intruder they made no scruple to jostle him aside while one less kind than the rest or more of a wag by an unobserved stroke dexterously flattened down his fleecy hat upon his head without readjusting it the stranger quietly turned and writing anew upon the slate again held it up charity suffereth long and is kind illy pleased with his pertinacity as they thought it the crowd a second time thrust him aside and not without epithets and some buffets all of which were unresented but as if at last despairing of so difficult an adventure wherein one apparently a non resistant sought to impose his presence upon fighting characters the stranger now moved slowly away yet not before altering his writing to this charity endureth all things shield like bearing his slate before him amid stares and jeers he moved slowly up and down at his turning points again changing his inscription to charity believeth all things and then charity never faileth the word charity as originally traced remained throughout uneffaced not unlike the left hand numeral of a printed date otherwise left for convenience in blank to some observers the singularity if not lunacy of the stranger was heightened by his muteness and perhaps also by the contrast to his proceedings afforded in the actions quite in the wonted and sensible order of things of the barber of the boat whose quarters under a smoking saloon and over against a bar room was next door but two to the captain s office as if the long wide covered deck hereabouts built up on both sides with shop like windowed spaces were some constantinople arcade or bazaar where more than one trade is plied this river barber aproned and slippered but rather crusty looking for the moment it may be from being newly out of bed was throwing open his premises for the day and suitably arranging the exterior with business like dispatch having rattled down his shutters and at a palm tree angle set out in the iron fixture his little ornamental pole and this without overmuch tenderness for the elbows and toes of the crowd he concluded his operations by bidding people stand still more aside when jumping on a stool he hung over his door on the customary nail a gaudy sort of illuminated pasteboard sign skillfully executed by himself gilt with the likeness of a razor elbowed in readiness to shave and also for the public benefit with two words not unfrequently seen ashore gracing other shops besides barbers no trust an inscription which though in a sense not less intrusive than the contrasted ones of the stranger did not as it seemed provoke any corresponding derision or surprise much less indignation and still less to all appearances did it gain for the inscriber the repute of being a simpleton meanwhile he with the slate continued moving slowly up and down not without causing some stares to change into jeers and some jeers into pushes and some pushes into punches when suddenly in one of his turns he was hailed from behind by two porters carrying a large trunk but as the summons though loud was without effect they accidentally or otherwise swung their burden against him nearly overthrowing him when by a quick start a peculiar inarticulate moan and a pathetic telegraphing of his fingers he involuntarily betrayed that he was not alone dumb but also deaf presently as if not wholly unaffected by his reception thus far he went forward seating himself in a retired spot on the forecastle nigh the foot of a ladder there leading to a deck above up and down which ladder some of the boatmen in discharge of their duties were occasionally going from his betaking himself to this humble quarter it was evident that as a deck passenger the stranger simple though he seemed was not entirely ignorant of his place though his taking a deck passage might have been partly for convenience as from his having no luggage it was probable that his destination was one of the small wayside landings within a few hours sail but though he might not have a long way to go yet he seemed already to have come from a very long

having been endowed at its birth or during its growth with proper means for accommodating its own increasing proportions was it not well to lay down fine avenues and broad streets so that future citizens might find a city well prepared to their hand there is no doubt much in such an argument but its correctness must be tested by its success when a man marries it is well that be should make provision for a coming family but a benedict who early in his career shall have carried his friends with considerable self applause through half a dozen nurseries and at the end of twelve years shall still be the father of one rickety baby will incur a certain amount of ridicule it is very well to be prepared for good fortune but one should limit one s preparation within a reasonable scope two miles by one might perhaps have done for the skeleton sketch of a new city less than half that would contain much more than the present population of washington and there are i fear few towns in the union so little likely to enjoy any speedy increase three avenues sweep the whole length of washington virginia avenue pennsylvania avenue and massachusetts avenue but pennsylvania avenue is the only one known to ordinary men and the half of that only is so known this avenue is the backbone of the city and those streets which are really inhabited cluster round that half of it which runs westward from the capitol the eastern end running from the front of the capitol is again a desert the plan of the city is somewhat complicated it may truly be called a mighty maze but not without a plan the capitol was intended to be the center of the city it faces eastward away from the potomac or rather from the main branch of the potomac and also unfortunately from the main body of the town it turns its back upon the chief thoroughfare upon the treasury buildings and upon the president s house and indeed upon the whole place it was i suppose intended that the streets to the eastward should be noble and populous but hitherto they have come to nothing the building therefore is wrong side foremost and all mankind who enter it senators representatives and judges included go in at the back door of course it is generally known that in the capitol is the chamber of the senate that of the house of representatives and the supreme judicial court of the union it may be said that there are two centers in washington this being one and the president s house the other at these centers the main avenues are supposed to cross each other which avenues are called by the names of the respective states at the capitol pennsylvania avenue new jersey avenue delaware avenue and maryland avenue converge they come from one extremity of the city to the square of the capitol on one side and run out from the other side of it to the other extremity of the city pennsylvania avenue new york avenue vermont avenue and connecticut avenue do the same at what is generally called president s square in theory or on paper this seems to be a clear and intelligible arrangement but it does not work well these center depots are large spaces and consequently one portion of a street is removed a considerable distance from the other it is as though the same name should be given to two streets one of which entered st james s park at buckingham gate while the other started from the park at marlborough house to inhabitants the matter probably is not of much moment as it is well known that this portion of such an avenue and that portion of such another avenue are merely myths unknown lands away in the wilds but a stranger finds himself in the position of being sent across the country knee deep into the mud wading through snipe grounds looking for civilization where none exists all these avenues have a slanting direction they are so arranged that none of them run north and south or east and west but the streets so called all run in accordance with the points of the compass those from east to west are a street b street c street and so on counting them away from the capitol on each side so that there are two a streets and two b streets on the map these streets run up to v street both right and left v street north and v street south those really known to mankind are e f g h i and k streets north then those streets which run from north to south are numbered first street second street third street and so on on each front of the capitol running to twenty fourth or twenty fifth street on each side not very many of these have any existence or i might perhaps more properly say any vitality in their existence such is the plan of the city that being the arrangement and those the dimensions intended by the original architects and founders of washington but the inhabitants have hitherto confined themselves to pennsylvania avenue west and to the streets abutting from it or near to it whatever address a stranger may receive however perplexing it may seem to him he may be sure that the house indicated is near pennsylvania avenue if it be not i should recommend him to pay no attention to the summons even in those streets with which he will become best acquainted the houses are not continuous there will be a house and then a blank then two houses and then a double blank after that a hut or two and then probably an excellent roomy handsome family mansion taken altogether washington as a city is most unsatisfactory and falls more grievously short of the thing attempted than any other of the great undertakings of which i have seen anything in

the foregoing prediction may seem the facts of the last half century will we think justify it if the manhattan towns or manhattan as we shall not scruple to term the several places that compose the prosperous sisterhood at the mouth of the hudson a name that is more ancient and better adapted to the history associations and convenience of the place than any other continue to prosper as they have done ere the close of the present century they will take their station among the capitals of the first rank it may require a longer period to collect the accessories of a first class place for these are the products of time and cultivation though the facilities of intercourse the spirit of the age and the equalizing sentiment that marks the civilization of the epoch will greatly hasten everything in the shape of improvement new york will probably never possess any churches of an architecture to attract attention for their magnitude and magnificence the policy of the country which separates religion from the state precludes this by confining all the expenditures of this nature to the several parishes few of which are rich enough to do more than erect edifices of moderate dimensions and cost the romish church so much addicted to addressing the senses manifests some desire to construct its cathedrals but they are necessarily confined to the limits and ornaments suited to the resources of a branch of the church that in this country is by no means affluent the manner in which the americans are subdivided into sects also conflicts with any commendable desire that may exist to build glorious temples in honor of the deity and convenience is more consulted than taste perhaps in all that relates to ecclesiastical architecture nevertheless a sensible improvement in this respect has occurred within the last few years to which we shall elsewhere advert it will be in their trade their resources their activity and their influence on the rest of the world as well as in their population that the towns of manhattan will be first entitled to rank with the larger capitals of europe so obvious rapid and natural has been the advance of all the places that it is not easy for the mind to regard anything belonging to them as extraordinary or out of rule there is not a port in the whole country that is less indebted to art and the fostering hand of government than this it is true certain forts most of them of very doubtful necessity have been constructed for defence but no attack having ever been contemplated or if contemplated attempted they have been dead letters in the history of its progress we are not aware that government has ever expended one cent in the waters of manhattan except for the surveys construction of the aforesaid military works and the erection of the lighthouses that form a part of the general provision for the safe navigation of the entire coast some money has been expended for the improvement of the shallow waters of the hudson but it has been as much or more for the advantage of the upper towns and the trade coastwise generally than for the special benefit of new york the immense natural advantages of the bays and islands at the mouth of the hudson have in a great degree superseded the necessity of such assistance nature has made every material provision for a mart of the first importance and perhaps it has been fortunate that the towns have been left like healthful and vigorous children managed by prudent parents to take the inclination and growth pointed out to them by this safest and best of guides london is indebted to artificial causes in a great degree for its growth and power that great law of trade which renders settling places indispensable has contributed to her prosperity and continued ascendency long after the day when rival ports are carrying away her fleets and commerce she is a proof of the difficulty of shaking a commercial superiority long established scarce a cargo that enters the ports of the kingdom that does not pay tribute to her bankers or merchants but london is a political capital and that in a country where the representation of the government is more imposing possessing greater influence than in any other christian nation the english aristocracy which wields the real authority of the state here makes its annual exhibition of luxury and wealth such as the world has never beheld anywhere else ancient rome possibly excepted and has had a large share in rendering london what it is new york has none of this adventitious aid both of the governments that of the united states and that of the state have long been taken from her leaving her nothing of this sort but her own local authorities but representation forms no part of the machinery of american policy it is supposed that man is too intellectual and philosophical to need it in this intellectual and philosophical country par excellence although such is the theory the whole struggle in private life is limited to the impression made by representation in the hands of individuals that which the government has improvidently cast aside society has seized upon and hundreds who have no claim to distinction beyond the possession of money profit by the mistake to place themselves in positions perhaps that they are not always exactly qualified to fill of all social usurpations that of mere money is the least tolerable as one may have a very full purse with empty brains and vulgar tastes and habits the wisdom of thus throwing the control of a feature of society that is of much more moment than is commonly supposed into the chapter of commercial accidents may well he questioned some crude attempts have been made to bring the circles of new york within the control of a code

thus wore away her long sad peaceful and fantastic life till few were so old as she and the people of later generations wondered how the dead had ever been buried or mourners had endured their grief without the old maid in the winding sheet still years went on and still she followed funerals and was not yet summoned to her own festival of death one afternoon the great street of the town was all alive with business and bustle though the sun now gilded only the upper half of the church spire having left the housetops and loftiest trees in shadow the scene was cheerful and animated in spite of the sombre shade between the high brick buildings here were pompous merchants in white wigs and laced velvet the bronzed faces of sea captains the foreign garb and air of spanish creoles and the disdainful port of natives of old england all contrasted with the rough aspect of one or two hack settlers negotiating sales of timber from forests where axe had never sounded sometimes a lady passed swelling roundly forth in an embroidered petticoat balancing her steps in high heeled shoes and courtesying with lofty grace to the punctilious obeisances of the gentlemen the life of the town seemed to have its very centre not far from an old mansion that stood somewhat back from the pavement surrounded by neglected grass with a strange air of loneliness rather deepened than dispelled by the throng so near it its site would have been suitably occupied by a magnificent exchange or a brick block lettered all over with various signs or the large house itself might have made a noble tavern with the king s arms swinging before it and guests in every chamber instead of the present solitude but owing to some dispute about the right of inheritance the mansion had been long without a tenant decaying from year to year and throwing the stately gloom of its shadow over the busiest part of the town such was the scene and such the time when a figure unlike any that have been described was observed at a distance down the street i espy a strange sail yonder remarked a liverpool captain that woman in the long white garment the sailor seemed much struck by the object as were several others who at the same moment caught a glimpse of the figure that had attracted his notice almost immediately the various topics of conversation gave place to speculations in an undertone on this unwonted occurrence can there be a funeral so late this afternoon inquired some they looked for the signs of death at every door the sexton the hearse the assemblage of black clad relatives all that makes up the woeful pomp of funerals they raised their eyes also to the sun gilt spire of the church and wondered that no clang proceeded from its bell which had always tolled till now when this figure appeared in the light of day but none had heard that a corpse was to be borne to its home that afternoon nor was there any token of a funeral except the apparition of the old maid in the winding sheet what may this portend asked each man of his neighbor all smiled as they put the question yet with a certain trouble in their eyes as if pestilence or some other wide calamity were prognosticated by the untimely intrusion among the living of one whose presence had always been associated with death and woe what a comet is to the earth was that sad woman to the town still she moved on while the hum of surprise was hushed at her approach and the proud and the humble stood aside that her white garment might not wave against them it was a long loose robe of spotless purity its wearer appeared very old pale emaciated and feeble yet glided onward without the unsteady pace of extreme age at one point of her course a littly rosy boy burst forth from a door and ran with open arms towards the ghostly woman seeming to expect a kiss from her bloodless lips she made a slight pause fixing her eye upon him with an expression of no earthly sweetness so that the child shivered and stood awe struck rather than affrighted while the old maid passed on perhaps her garment might have been polluted even by an infant s touch perhaps her kiss would have been death to the sweet boy within a year she is but a shadow whispered the superstitious the child put forth his arms and could not grasp her robe the wonder was increased when the old maid passed beneath the porch of the deserted mansion ascended the moss covered steps lifted the iron knocker and gave three raps the people could only conjecture that some old remembrance troubling her bewildered brain had impelled the poor woman hither to visit the friends of her youth all gone from their home long since and forever unless their ghosts still haunted it fit company for the old maid in the winding sheet an elderly man approached the steps and reverently uncovering his gray locks essayed to explain the matter none madam said he have dwelt in this house these fifteen years agone no not since the death of old colonel fenwicke whose funeral you may remember to have followed his heirs being ill agreed among themselves have let the mansion house go to ruin the old maid looked slowly round with a slight gesture of one hand and a finger of the other upon her lip appearing more shadow like than ever in the obscurity of the porch but again she lifted the hammer and gave this time a single rap could it be that a footstep was now heard coming down the staircase of the old mansion which all conceived to have been so long untenanted slowly feebly yet heavily like the pace of an aged and infirm person the step approached more distinct on every downward stair till

archdeacon their own private knowledge that the ministry must fall within five days the son returned to his father s room and after administering with his own hands the sustaining modicum of madeira sat down by the bedside to calculate his chances the ministry were to be out within five days his father was to be dead within no he rejected that view of the subject the ministry were to be out and the diocese might probably be vacant at the same period there was much doubt as to the names of the men who were to succeed to power and a week must elapse before a cabinet was formed would not vacancies be filled by the outgoing men during this week dr grantly had a kind of idea that such would be the case but did not know and then he wondered at his own ignorance on such a question he tried to keep his mind away from the subject but he could not the race was so very close and the stakes were so very high he then looked at the dying man s impassive placid face there was no sign there of death or disease it was something thinner than of yore somewhat grayer and the deep lines of age more marked but as far as he could judge life might yet hang there for weeks to come sir lamda mewnew and sir omicron pie had thrice been wrong and might yet be wrong thrice again the old bishop slept during twenty of the twenty four hours but during the short periods of his waking moments he knew both his son and his dear old friend mr harding the archdeacon s father in law and would thank them tenderly for their care and love now he lay sleeping like a baby resting easily on his back his mouth just open and his few gray hairs straggling from beneath his cap his breath was perfectly noiseless and his thin wan hand which lay above the coverlid never moved nothing could be easier than the old man s passage from this world to the next but by no means easy were the emotions of him who sat there watching he knew it must be now or never he was already over fifty and there was little chance that his friends who were now leaving office would soon return to it no probable british prime minister but he who was now in he who was so soon to be out would think of making a bishop of dr grantly thus he thought long and sadly in deep silence and then gazed at that still living face and then at last dared to ask himself whether he really longed for his father s death the effort was a salutary one and the question was answered in a moment the proud wishful worldly man sank on his knees by the bedside and taking the bishop s hand within his own prayed eagerly that his sins might be forgiven him his face was still buried in the clothes when the door of the bedroom opened noiselessly and mr harding entered with a velvet step mr harding s attendance at that bedside had been nearly as constant as that of the archdeacon and his ingress and egress was as much a matter of course as that of his son in law he was standing close beside the archdeacon before he was perceived and would also have knelt in prayer had he not feared that his doing so might have caused some sudden start and have disturbed the dying man dr grantly however instantly perceived him and rose from his knees as he did so mr harding took both his hands and pressed them warmly there was more fellowship between them at that moment than there had ever been before and it so happened that after circumstances greatly preserved the feeling as they stood there pressing each other s hands the tears rolled freely down their cheeks god bless you my dears said the bishop with feeble voice as he woke god bless you may god bless you both my dear children and so he died there was no loud rattle in the throat no dreadful struggle no palpable sign of death but the lower jaw fell a little from its place and the eyes which had been so constantly closed in sleep now remained fixed and open neither mr harding nor dr grantly knew that life was gone though both suspected it i believe it s all over said mr harding still pressing the other s hands i think nay i hope it is i will ring the bell said the other speaking all but in a whisper mrs phillips should be here mrs phillips the nurse was soon in the room and immediately with practised hand closed those staring eyes it s all over mrs phillips asked mr harding my lord s no more said mrs phillips turning round and curtseying low with solemn face his lordship s gone more like a sleeping babby than any that i ever saw it s a great relief archdeacon said mr harding a great relief dear good excellent old man oh that our last moments may be as innocent and as peaceful as his surely said mrs phillips the lord be praised for all his mercies but for a meek mild gentle spoken christian his lordship was and mrs phillips with unaffected but easy grief put up her white apron to her flowing eyes you cannot but rejoice that it is over said mr harding still consoling his friend the archdeacon s mind however had already travelled from the death chamber to the closet of the prime minister he had brought himself to pray for his father s life but now that that life was done minutes were too precious to be lost it was now useless to dally with the fact of the bishop s death useless to lose perhaps everything for the pretence of a foolish sentiment but how was he to act while his father in law stood there holding his hand how without appearing unfeeling was he to forget his father in the bishop to overlook what he had lost and think only of what he might possibly gain no i suppose not said he at last in answer to mr harding we have all expected it so long mr harding took him by the arm and led him from the room we will see him again to morrow morni

camacho s wedding will do for the peasantry roasted oxen and a capon in every platter with some fountains of ale and good porto our marmitons too can easily serve the provincial noblesse but there is to be a party at the castle of double cream princes of the blood high relatives and grandees of the golden fleece the duke s cook is not equal to the occasion tis an hereditary chef who gives dinners of the time of the continental blockade they have written to daubuz to send them the first artist of the age said leander and added he with some hesitation daubuz has written to me and he did quite right my child said prevost for there is not a man in europe that is your equal what do they say that abreu rivals you in flavour and that gaillard has not less invention but who can combine go t with new combinations tis yourself leander and there is no question though you have only twenty five years that you are the chef of the age you are always very good to me sir said leander bending his head with great respect and i will not deny that to be famous when you are young is the fortune of the gods but we must never forget that i had an advantage which abreu and gaillard had not and that i was your pupil i hope that i have not injured you said papa prevost with an air of proud self content what you learned from me came at least from a good school it is something to have served under napoleon added prevost with the grand air of the imperial kitchen had it not been for waterloo i should have had the cross but the bourbons and the cooks of the empire never could understand each other they brought over an emigrant chef who did not comprehend the taste of the age he wished to bring everything back to the time of the oeil de bouf when monsieur passed my soup of austerlitz untasted i knew the old family was doomed but we gossip you wished to consult me i want not only your advice but your assistance this affair of the duke of bellamont requires all our energies i hope you will accompany me and indeed we must muster all our forces it is not to be denied that there is a want not only of genius but of men in our art the cooks are like the civil engineers since the middle class have taken to giving dinners the demand exceeds the supply there is andrien said papa prevost you had some hopes of him he is too young i took him to hellingsley and he lost his head on the third day i entrusted the souffl es to him and but for the most desperate personal exertions all would have been lost it was an affair of the bridge of areola ah mon dieu those are moments

the bargain is still advantageous to the foreigner because the commodity which he receives in exchange though it has cost us less would have cost him more as often as a country possesses two commodities one of which it can produce with less labour comparatively to what it would cost in a foreign country than the other so often it is the interest of the country to export the first mentioned commodity and to import the second even though it might be able to produce both the one and the other at a less expense of labour than the foreign country can produce them but not less in the same degree or might be unable to produce either except at a greater expense but not greater in the same degree on the contrary if it produces both commodities with greater facility or both with greater difficulty and greater in exactly the same degree there will be no motive to interchange if the cloth and the corn each of which required days labour in poland required each days labour in england it would follow that the cloth of days labour in england if sent to poland would be equal to the cloth of days labour in poland if exchanged for corn therefore it would exchange for the corn of only days labour but the corn of days labour in poland was supposed to be the same quantity with that of days labour in england with days labour in cloth therefore england would only get as much corn in poland as she could raise with days labour at home and she would in importing it have the cost of carriage besides in these circumstances no exchange would take place if on the other hand while the cloth produced with days labour in poland was produced with days labour in england the corn which was produced in poland with days labour could not be produced in england with less than days labour an adequate motive to exchange would immediately arise with a quantity of cloth which england produced with days labour she would be able to purchase as much corn in poland as was there produced with days labour but the quantity which was there produced with days labour would be as great as the quantity produced in england with days labour the power of poland would be reciprocal with a quantity of corn which cost her days labour equal to the quantity produced in england by days labour she could in the supposed case purchase in england the produce of days labour in cloth but the produce of days labour in england in the article of cloth would be equal to the produce of days labour in poland the remainder of what mr ricardo has done for the philosophical exposition of the principles of foreign trade is to shew that the truth of the propositions now recapitulated is not affected by the introduction of money as a medium of exchange the precious metals always tending to distribute themselves in such a manner throughout the commercial world that every country shall import all that it would have imported and export all that it would have exported if exchanges had taken place as in the example above supposed by barter to this branch of the subject we shall in the sequel of this essay return at present it will be more convenient that we should continue to suppose that exchanges take place by the direct trucking of one commodity against another it is established that the advantage which two countries derive from trading with each other results from the more advantageous employment which thence arises of the labour and capital for shortness let us say the labour of both jointly the circumstances are such that if each country confines itself to the production of one commodity there is a greater total return to the labour of both together and this increase of produce forms the whole of what the two countries taken together gain by the trade it is the purpose of the present essay to inquire in what proportion the increase of produce arising from the saving of labour is divided between the two countries this question was not entered into by mr ricardo whose attention was engrossed by far more important questions and who having a science to create had not time or room to occupy himself with much more than the leading principles when he had done enough to enable any one who came after him and who took the necessary pains to do all the rest he was satisfied he very rarely followed out the principles of the science into the ramifications of their consequences but we believe that to no one who has thoroughly entered into the spirit of his discoveries will even the minutiae of the science offer any difficulty but that which is constituted by the necessity of patience and circumspection in tracing principles to their results mr ricardo while intending to go no further into the question of the advantage of foreign trade than to show what it consisted of and under what circumstances it arose unguardedly expressed himself as if each of the two countries making the exchange separately gained the whole of the difference between the comparative costs of the two commodities in one country and in the other but the whole gain of both countries together consisting in the saving of labour and the saving of labour being exactly equal to the difference between the costs in the two countries of the one commodity as compared with the other the two countries taken together gain no more than this difference and if either country gains the whole of it the other country derives no advantage from the trade suppose for example that yards of broad cloth cost in england as much labour as yards of linen and in germany as much as if england sends yards of broad cloth to germany and is able to exchange them for linen according to the german cost of production sh

shall walk about familiar places and we shall explore streets and houses that have been buried for centuries we shall go down deep into the earth and we shall float in a balloon high up into the air we shall see many beasts of the forest some that are bloody and cruel and others that are gentle and wise we will meet with birds fishes grand old buildings fleas vast woods bugs mummies snakes tight rope dancers gorillas will o the wisps beautiful blossoms boomerangs oceans birds nests and i cannot tell you what all besides we will also have some adventures hear some stories and have a peep at a fairy or two before we are done i shall not however be able to go with you everywhere when you are enjoying a bird chat buying the mirror learning when we must not believe our eyes visiting a city under the ground hearing of the coachman s troubles sitting under the oak tree finding out wonderful things about glass watching what happens when school s out or following the fortunes of carl your guide will be a lady and i think that you will all agree that she knows very well where she ought to go and how to get there the rest of the time you will be with me and now having talked enough suppose we start winter in the woods illustration what can be more delightful to a boy of spirit than a day in the woods when there has been a good snow if he also happens to have a good friend or two and some good dogs who are just as likely to be friends as his boy companions he ought to be much happier than an ordinary king a forest is a fine place at any time but when the ground is well covered with snow especially if there is a hard crust upon it the woods seem to possess a peculiar charm you can go anywhere then in the summer the thick undergrowth the intertwining vines and the heavy lower branches of the trees make it difficult even to see into the dark recesses of the forest but in the winter all is open the low wet places the deep holes the rotten bogs everything on the ground that is in the way of a good run and a jump is covered up you do not walk a hundred yards under the bare branches of the trees before up starts a rabbit or a hare if you would rather call him by his right name and away go the dogs and away you go all of you tearing along at the top of your speed but poor bunny has a small chance when a hard snow is on the ground his hiding places are all covered up and before he knows it the dogs have caught him and your mother will have stewed rabbit for supper it seems a hard fate for the poor little fellow but he was born partly for that purpose when you have caught your rabbit and come back to where the men are cutting wood you will be just as proud to tell the boy who is cutting up the branches all about your splendid hunt as if you had chased and killed a stag there s where we started him you will cry and away he scudded over there among the chestnuts and rover right at his heels and when we got down there to the creek rover turned heels over head on the ice he was going so fast but i gave one slide right across and just up there by the big walnut the other two dogs got him that boy is almost as much excited as you are and he would drop his axe in one minute and be off with you on another chase if his father were not there and now you find that you have reached the wood cutters exactly in time for that great tree is just about to come down there go the top branches moving slowly along through the tops of the other trees and now they move faster and everything begins to crack and with a rush and a clatter of breaking limbs the great oak comes crashing down jarring the very earth beneath your feet and making the snow fly about like a sparkling cloud while away run the dogs with their tails between their legs the tree is down now and you will want to be home in time for dinner farmer brown s sled has just passed and if you will cut across the woods you can catch up with him and have a ride home and tell him all about the rabbit hunt on the way if it is saturday and a holiday you will be out again this afternoon with some of the other boys perhaps and have a grand hunt suppose it is snowing what will you care you will not mind the snow any more than if it were a shower of blossoms from the apple trees in may tricks of light illustration there is nothing more straightforward in its ways than light when we let it alone but like many of us when it is introduced to the inventions and contrivances of the civilized world it often becomes exceedingly fond of vagaries and extravagances of all the companions of light which endeavor to induce it to forsake its former simple habits there is not one which has the influence possessed by glass when light and glass get together it is difficult to divine what tricks they are going to perform but some of these are very interesting if they are a little wild and there are very few of us who do not enjoy them illustration for instance what a delight to any company be it composed of young folks or old is a magic lantern the most beautiful and the most absurd pictures may be made to appear upon the wall or screen but there is an instrument called the phantasmagoria which is really nothing but an improved magic lantern which is capable of producing much more striking effects it is a much larger instrument than the other and when it is exhibited a screen is placed between it and the spectators so that they do not see how the pictures are produced it is mounted on castors so that at times it can be brought nearer and nearer to the screen until the picture seems to enlarge and grow in a wonderful manner then when it is drawn back the image diminishes and recedes far into

easy reinhart fell into step beside the bigger man they passed through the check and into the auxiliary labs no immediate coercion will be exerted over you or your staff you re free to continue your work as you see fit for the present let s get this straight my concern is to integrate your work with our total social needs as long as your work is sufficiently productive reinhart stopped in his tracks pretty isn t he sherikov said ironically what the hell is it icarus we call him remember the greek myth the legend of icarus icarus flew this icarus is going to fly one of these days sherikov shrugged you can examine him if you want i suppose this is what you came here to see reinhart advanced slowly this is the weapon you ve been working on how does he look rising up in the center of the chamber was a squat metal cylinder a great ugly cone of dark gray technicians circled around it wiring up the exposed relay banks reinhart caught a glimpse of endless tubes and filaments a maze of

same man who developed our instantaneous interstellar vidcasts forty years ago he was trying to find a method of faster than light travel when he was killed destroyed along with most of his work after that ftl research was abandoned it looked as if there were no future in it wasn t it shown that nothing could travel faster than light the interstellar vidcasts do no hedge developed a valid ftl drive he managed to propel an object at fifty times the speed of light but as the object gained speed its length began to diminish and its mass increased this was in line with familiar twentieth century concepts of mass energy transformation we conjectured that as hedge s object gained velocity it would continue to lose length and gain mass until its length became nil and its mass infinite nobody can imagine such an object go on but what actually occurred is this hedge s object continued to lose length and gain mass until it reached the theoretical limit of velocity the speed of light at that point the object still gaining speed simply ceased to exist having no length it ceased to occupy space it disappeared however the object had not been destroyed it continued on its way gaining momentum each moment moving in an arc across the galaxy away from the sol system hedge s object entered some other realm of being beyond our powers of conception the next phase of hedge s experiment consisted in a search for some way to slow the ftl object down back to a sub ftl speed hence back into our universe this counterprinciple was eventually worked out with what result the death of hedge and destruction of most of his equipment his experimental object in re entering the space time universe came into being in space already occupied by matter possessing an incredible mass just below infinity level hedge s object exploded in a titanic cataclysm it was obvious that no space travel was possible with such a drive virtually all space contains some matter to re enter space would bring

jumped down and followed him i don t get it reinhart said you said the principle is no good for space travel that s right what s this for then if the ship explodes as soon as it returns to our universe this is not a ship sherikov grinned slyly icarus is the first practical application of hedge s principles icarus is a bomb so this is our weapon reinhart said a bomb an immense bomb a bomb moving at a velocity greater than light a bomb which will not exist in our universe the centaurans won t be able to detect or stop it how could they as soon as it passes the speed of light it will cease to exist beyond all detection but icarus will be launched outside the lab on the surface he will align himself with proxima centaurus gaining speed rapidly by the time he reaches his destination he will be traveling at ftl icarus will be brought back to this universe within centaurus itself the explosion should destroy the star and wash away most of its planets including their central hub planet armun there is no way they can halt icarus once he has been launched no defense is possible nothing can stop him it is a real fact when will he be ready sherikov s eyes flickered soon exactly how soon the big pole hesitated as a matter of fact there s only one thing holding us back sherikov led reinhart around to the other side of the lab he pushed a lab guard out of the way see this he tapped a round globe open at one end the size of a grapefruit this is holding us up what is it the central control turret this thing brings icarus back to sub ftl flight at the correct moment it must be absolutely accurate icarus will be within the star only a matter of a microsecond if the turret does not function exactly icarus will pass out the other side and shoot beyond the centauran system

thoughts i gathered that must be so from your letter how i wonder i could not say i asked them and of course they were vague or perhaps it was just that i could not understand it involves a projector for the focussing of thought and even more than that conscious attention on the part of both projector and receptor it was quite a while before i realized they were trying to think at me such thought projectors may be part of the science they will give us perhaps said the industrialist yet think of the changes it would bring to society a thought projector why not change would be good for us i don

liked to see him he s such a glorious snake the lights and shades on his back are so glancing and so wonderful he s a perfect model of course you re painting him the stranger started i m painting him yes that s true he replied with a look of sudden surprise but why of course please how on earth could you tell i was an artist even elma glanced back in his face and wondered to herself too now she came to think of it how did she know that handsome young man with the charming features and the expressive eyes and the neatly cut brown beard and the attractive manner was an artist at all or anything like it and how did she know the snake was his model for the life of her she couldn t have answered those questions herself i suppose i just guessed it she answered after a short pause blushing still more deeply at the sudden way she had thus been dragged into conversation with the good looking stranger elma s skin was dark a clear and creamy olive brown complexion such as one sometimes sees in southern europe though rarely in england and the effect of the blush through it didn t pass unnoticed by cyril waring s artistic eye he would have given something for the chance of transferring that delicious effect to canvas the delicate transparency of the blush threw up those piercing dark eyes and reflected lustre even on the glossy black hair that fringed her forehead not an english type of beauty at all elma clifford s he thought to himself as he eyed her closely rather spanish or italian or say even hungarian well you guessed right at any rate he went on settling down in his seat once more after boxing his snake but this time face to face with her i m working at a beautiful bit of fern and foliage quite tropical in its way in a wood hereabout and i ve introduced sardanapalus coiled up in the foreground just to give life to the scene don t you know and an excuse for a title i mean to call it the rajah s rest behind great ferns and a mossy bank in front sardanapalus after tiffin rolled spirally round and taking his siesta this meeting was a long wished for occasion elma had never before met a real live painter now it was the cherished idea of her youth to see something some day of that wonderful non existent fantastic world which we still hope for and dream about and call bohemia she longed to move in literary and artistic circles she had fashioned to herself like many other romantic girls a rose coloured picture of bohemian existence not knowing indeed that bohemia is now alas an extinct province since belgravia and kensington swallowed it bodily down digested and assimilated it so this casual talk with the handsome young artist in the second class carriage on the great southern line was to elma as a charming and delightful glimpse of an enchanted region she could never enter it was paradise to the peri she turned the conversation at once therefore with resolute intent upon art and artists determined to make the most while it lasted of this unique opportunity and since the subject of self with an attentive listener is always an attractive one even to modest young men like cyril waring especially when it s a pretty girl who encourages you to dilate upon it why the consequence was that before many minutes were over the handsome young man was discoursing from his full heart to a sympathetic soul about his chosen art its hopes and its ideals accompanied by a running fire of thumb nail illustrations he had even got so far in the course of their intimacy as to take out the portfolio which lay hidden under the seat out of deference to his disguise as a stock broker no doubt and to display before elma s delighted eyes with many explanatory comments as to light and shade or perspective and foreshortening the studies for the picture he had just then engaged upon by and by as his enthusiasm warmed under elma s encouragement the young

grunted here he passed it to his companions i think this is what we ve been waiting for they certainly took their time about it so they want to talk terms scott said are we going along with them that s not for us to decide hendricks sat down where s the communications officer i want the moon base leone pondered as the communications officer raised the outside antenna cautiously scanning the sky above the bunker for any sign of a watching russian ship sir scott said to hendricks it s sure strange they suddenly came around we ve been using the claws for almost a year now all of a sudden they start to fold maybe claws have been getting down in their bunkers one of the big ones the kind with stalks got into an ivan bunker last week eric said it got a whole platoon of them before they got their lid shut how do you know a buddy told me the thing came back with with remains moon base sir the communications officer said on the screen the face of the lunar monitor appeared his crisp uniform contrasted to the uniforms in the bunker and he was clean shaven moon base this is forward command l whistle on terra let me have general thompson the monitor faded presently general thompson s heavy features came into focus what is it major our claws got a single russian runner with a message we don t know whether to act on it there have been tricks like this in the past what s the message the russians want us to send a single officer on policy level over to their lines for a conference they don t state the nature of the conference they say that matters of he consulted the slip matters of grave urgency make it advisable that discussion be opened between a representative of the un forces and themselves he held the message up to the screen for the general to scan thompson s eyes moved what should we do hendricks said send a man out you don t think it s a trap it might be but the location they give for their forward command is correct it s worth a try at any rate i ll send an officer out and report the results to you as soon as he returns all right major thompson broke the connection the screen died up above the antenna came slowly down hendricks rolled up the paper deep in thought i ll go leone said they want somebody at policy level hendricks rubbed his jaw policy level i haven t been outside in months maybe i could use a little air don t you think it s risky hendricks lifted the view sight and gazed into it the remains of the russian were gone only a single claw was in sight it was folding itself back disappearing into the ash like a crab like some hideous metal crab that s the only thing that bothers me hendricks rubbed his wrist i know i m safe as long as i have this on me but there s something about them i hate the damn things i wish we d never invented them there s something wrong with them relentless little if we hadn t invented them the ivans would have hendricks pushed the sight back anyhow it seems to be winning the war i guess that s good sounds like you re getting the same jitters as the ivans hendricks examined his wrist watch i guess i had better get started if i want to be there before dark he took a deep breath and then stepped out onto the gray rubbled ground after a minute he lit a cigarette and stood gazing around him the landscape was dead nothing stirred he could see for miles endless ash and slag ruins of buildings a few trees without leaves or branches only the trunks above him the eternal rolling clouds of gray drifting between terra and the sun major hendricks went on off to the right something scuttled something round and metallic a claw going lickety split after something probably after a small animal a rat they got rats too as a sort of sideline he came to the top of the little hill and lifted his fieldglasses the russian lines were a few miles ahead of him they had a forward command post there the runner had come from it a squat robot with undulating arms passed by him its arms weaving inquiringly the robot went on its way disappearing under some debris hendricks watched it go he had never seen that type before there were getting to be more and more types he had never seen new varieties and sizes coming up from the underground factories hendricks put out his cigarette and hurried on it was interesting the use of artificial forms in warfare how had they got started necessity the soviet union had gained great initial success usual with the side that got the war going most of north america had been blasted off the map retaliation was quick in coming of course the sky was full of circling disc bombers long before the war began they had been up there for years the discs began sailing down all over russia within hours after washington got it but that hadn t helped washington the american bloc governments moved to the moon base the first year there was not much else to do europe was gone a slag heap with dark weeds growing from the ashes and bones most of north america was useless nothing could be planted no one could live a few million people kept going up in canada and down in south america but during the second year soviet parachutists began to drop a few at first then more and more they wore the first really effective anti radiation equipment what was left of american production moved to the moon along with the governments all but the troops the remaining troops stayed behind as best they could a few thousand here a platoon there no one knew exactly where they were they stayed where they coul
0,2003,Kite Runner,5,that same night i wrote my first short story it took me thirty minutes it was a dark little tale about a man who found a magic cup and learned that if he wept into the cup his tears turned into pearls but even though he had always been poor he was a happy man and rarely shed a tear so he found ways to make himself sad so that his tears could make him rich as the pearls piled up so did his greed grow the story ended with the man sitting on a mountain of pearls knife in hand weeping helplessly into the cup with his beloved wife s slain body in his arms

3,2003,The curious incident of the dog in the night,5,a lie is when you say something happened which didn t happen but there is only ever one thing which happened at a particular time and a particular place and there are an infinite number of things which didn t happen at that time and that place and if i think about something which didn t happen i start thinking about all the other things which didn t happen for example this morning for breakfast i had ready brek and some hot raspberry milkshake but if i say that i actually had shreddies and a mug of tea i start thinking about coco pops and lemonade and porridge and dr pepper and how i wasn t eating my breakfast in egypt and there wasn t a rhinoceros in the room and father wasn t wearing a diving suit and so on and even writing this makes me feel shaky and scared like i do when i m standing on the top of a very tall building and there are thousands of houses and cars and people below me and my head is so full of all these things that i m afraid that i m going to forget to stand up straight and hang onto the rail and i m going to fall over and be killed
4,2005,Twilight,5,i didn t see him leap me it was much too fast i only found myself suddenly airborne and then we crashed onto the sofa knocking it into the wall all the while his arms formed an iron cage of protection around me i was barely jostled but i still was gasping as i tried to right myself he wasn t having that he curled me into a ball against his chest holding me more securely than iron chains i glared at him in alarm but he seemed well in control his jaw relaxed as he grinned his eyes bright only with humor
5,2001,Atonement,5,now and then an inch below the water s surface the muscles of his stomach tightened involuntarily as he recalled another detail a drop of water on her upper arm wet an embroidered flower a simple daisy sewn between the cups of her bra her breasts wide apart and small on her back a mole half covered by a strap when she climbed out of the pond a glimpse of the triangular darkness her knickers were supposed to conceal wet he saw it he made himself see it again the way her pelvic bones stretched the material clear of the skin the deep curve of her waist her startling whiteness when she reached for her skirt a carelessly raised foot revealed a patch of soil on each pad of her sweetly diminished toes another mole the size of a farthing on her thigh and something purplish on her calf a strawberry mark a scar not blemishes adornments
6,2005,never let me go,5,that was the only time as i stood there looking at that strange rubbish feeling the wind coming across those empty fields that i started to imagine just a little fantasy thing because this was norfolk after all and it was only a couple of weeks since i d lost him i was thinking about the rubbish the flapping plastic in the branches the shore line of odd stuff caught along the fencing and i half closed my eyes and imagined this was the spot where everything i d ever lost since my childhood had washed up and i was now standing here in front of it and if i waited long enough a tiny figure would appear on the horizon across the field and gradually get larger until i d see it was tommy and he d wave maybe even call the fantasy never got beyond that i didn t let it and though the tears rolled down my face i wasn t sobbing or out of control i just waited a bit then turned back to the car to drive off to wherever it was i was supposed to be
7,2002,middlesex,5,emotions in my experience aren t covered by single words i don t believe in sadness joy or regret maybe the best proof that the language is patriarchal is that it oversimplifies feeling i d like to have at my disposal complicated hybrid emotions germanic train car constructions like say the happiness that attends disaster or the disappointment of sleeping with one s fantasy i d like to show how intimations of mortality brought on by aging family members connects with the hatred of mirrors that begins in middle age i d like to have a word for the sadness inspired by failing restaurants as well as for the excitement of getting a room with a minibar i ve never had the right words to describe my life and now that i ve entered my story i need them more than ever

9,1999,the white teeth ,5,it s a funny thing about the modern world you hear girls in the toilets of clubs saying yeah he fucked off and left me he didn t love me he just couldn t deal with love he was too fucked up to know how to love me now how did that happen what was it about this unlovable century that convinced us we were despite everything eminently lovable as a people as a species what made us think that anyone who fails to love us is damaged lacking malfunctioning in some way and particularly if they replace us with a god or a weeping madonna or the face of christ in a ciabatta roll then we call them crazy deluded regressive we are so convinced of the goodness of ourselves and the goodness of our love we cannot bear to believe that there might be something more worthy of love than us more worthy of worship greeting cards routinely tell us everybody deserves love no everybody deserves clean water not everybody deserves love all the time

11,2003,a sorty history,5,thanks to ten minutes or so of balmy weather by the earth is covered in the great carboniferous forests whose residues give us all our coal and the first winged insects are evident dinosaurs plod onto the scene just before p m and hold sway for about three quarters of an hour at twenty one minutes to midnight they vanish and the age of mammals begins humans emerge one minute and seventeen seconds before midnight the whole of our recorded history on this scale would be no more than a few seconds a single human lifetime barely an instant throughout this greatly speeded up day continents slide about and bang together at a clip that seems positively reckless mountains rise and melt away ocean basins come and go ice sheets advance and withdraw and throughout the whole about three times every minute somewhere on the planet there is a flash bulb pop of light marking the impact of a manson sized meteor or one even larger it s a wonder that anything at all can survive in such a pummeled and unsettled environment in fact not many things do for long
12,2008,the white tiger,5,me and thousands of others in this country like me are half baked because we were never allowed to complete our schooling open our skulls look in with a penlight and you ll find an odd museum of ideas sentences of history or mathematics remembered from school textbooks no boy remembers his schooling like the one who was taken out of school let me assure you sentences about politics read in a newspaper while waiting for someone to come to an office triangles and pyramids seen on the torn pages of the old geometry textbooks which every tea shop in this country uses to wrap its snacks in bits of all india radio news bulletins things that drop into your mind like lizards from the ceiling in the half hour before falling asleep all these ideas half formed and half digested and half correct mix up with other half cooked ideas in your head and i guess these half formed ideas bugger one another and make more half formed ideas and this is what you act on and live with
13,2004,cloud atlas,5,belief like fear or love is a force to be understood as we understand the theory of relativity and principals of uncertainty phenomena that determine the course of our lives yesterday my life was headed in one direction today it is headed in another yesterday i believe i would never have done what i did today these forces that often remake time and space that can shape and alter who we imagine ourselves to be begin long before we are born and continue after we perish our lives and our choices like quantum trajectories are understood moment to moment that each point of intersection each encounter suggest a new potential direction proposition i have fallen in love with luisa rey is this possible i just met her and yet i feel like something important has happened to me
14,2006,the god delision,5,let us remind ourselves of the terminology a theist believes in a supernatural intelligence who in addition to his main work of creating the universe in the first place is still around to oversee and influence the subsequent fate of his initial creation in many theistic belief systems the deity is intimately involved in human affairs he answers prayers forgives or punishes sins intervenes in the world by performing miracles frets about good and bad deeds and knows when we do them or even think about doing them a deist too believes in a supernatural intelligence but one whose activities were confined to setting up the laws that govern the universe in the first place the deist god never intervenes thereafter and certainly has no specific interest in human affairs pantheists don t believe in a supernatural god at all but use the word god as a non supernatural synonym for nature or for the universe or for the lawfulness that governs its workings deists differ from theists in that their god does not answer prayers is not interested in sins or confessions does not read our thoughts and does not intervene with capricious miracles deists differ from pantheists in that the deist god is some kind of cosmic intelligence rather than the pantheist s metaphoric or poetic synonym for the laws of the universe pantheism is sexed up atheism deism is watered down theism
15,1993,the giver,5,lily appeared wearing her nightclothes in the doorway she gave an impatient sigh this is certainly a very long private conversation she said and there are certain people waiting for their comfort object lily her mother said fondly you re very close to being an eight and when you re an eight your comfort object will be taken away it will be recycled to the younger children you should be starting to go off to sleep without it but her father had already gone to the shelf and taken down the stuffed elephant which was kept there many of the comfort objects like lily s were soft stuffed imaginary creatures jonas s had been called a bear here you are lily billy he said i ll come help you remove your hair ribbons
16,1997,memoirsa of a geisha,5,to the eyes of the american soldiers who drove past i looked no different from the women around me and as i thought of it who could say i was any different if you no longer have leaves or bark or roots can you go on calling yourself a tree i am a peasant i said to myself and not a geisha at all any longer it was a frightening feeling to look at my hands and see their roughness to draw my mind away from my fears i turned my attention again to the truckloads of soldiers driving past weren t these the very american soldiers we d been taught to hate who had bombed our cities with such horrifying weapons now they rode through our neighborhood throwing pieces of candy to the children
17,1995,the golden compass,5,you are so young lyra too young to understand this but i shall tell you anyway and you ll understand it later men pass in front of our eyes like butterflies creatures of a brief season we love them they are brave proud beautiful clever and they die almost at once they die so soon that our hearts are continually racked with pain we bear their children who are witches if they are female human if not and then in the blink of an eye they are gone felled slain lost our sons too when a little boy is growing he thinks he is immortal his mother knows he isn t each time becomes more painful until finally your heart is broken perhaps that is when yambe akka comes for you she is older than the tundra perhaps for her witches lives are as brief as men s are to us
18,1998,the poison wood bible,5,but his kind will always lose in the end i know this and now i know why whether it s wife or nation they occupy their mistake is the same they stand still and their stake moves underneath them chains rattle rivers roll animals startle and bolt forests inspire and expand babies stretch open mouthed from the womb new seedlings arch their necks and creep forward into the light even a language won t stand still a territory is only possessed for a moment in time they stake everything on that moment posing for photographs while planting the flag casting themselves in bronze even before the flagpole begins to peel and splinter the ground underneath arches and slides forward into its own new destiny it may bear the marks of boots on its back but those marks become the possessions of the land
19,1999,the perks of being a wallflower,5,it s much easier to not know things sometimes things change and friends leave and life doesn t stop for anybody i wanted to laugh or maybe get mad or maybe shrug at how strange everybody was especially me i think the idea is that every person has to live for his or her own life and than make the choice to share it with other people you can t just sit their and put everybody s lives ahead of yours and think that counts as love you just can t you have to do things i m going to do what i want to do i m going to be who i really am and i m going to figure out what that is and we could all sit around and wonder and feel bad about each other and blame a lot of people for what they did or didn t do or what they didn t know i don t know i guess there could always be someone to blame it s just different maybe it s good to put things in perspective but sometimes i think that the only perspective is to really be there because it s okay to feel things i was really there and that was enough to make me feel infinite i feel infinite
20,1998,holes,5,he brought his tray to the table behind him a boy from one of the other tents said hey what happened to your face there was a crash stanley turned to see mr sir holding the boy s head against the oatmeal pot is something wrong with my face the boy tried to speak but couldn t mr sir had him by the throat does anyone see anything wrong with my face asked mr sir as he continued to choke the boy nobody said anything mr sir let the boy go his head banged against the table as he fell to the ground mr sir stood over him and asked how does my face look to you now a gurgling sound came out of the boy s mouth then he managed to gasp the word fine i m kind of handsome don t you think yes mr sir out

25,1992,the secret history,5,ery greek idea and a very profound one beauty is terror whatever we call beautiful we quiver before it and what could be more terrifying and beautiful to souls like the greeks or our own than to lose control completely to throw off the chains of being for an instant to shatter the accident of our mortal selves euripides speaks of the maenads head thrown i back throat to the stars more like deer than human being to be absolutely free one is quite capable of course of working out these destructive passions in more vulgar and less efficient ways but how glorious to release them in a single burst to sing to scream to dance barefoot in the woods in the dead of night with no more awareness of mortality than an animal these are powerful mysteries the bellowing of bulls springs of honey bubbling from the ground if we are strong enough in our souls we can rip away the veil and look that naked terrible beauty right in the face let god consume us devour us unstring our bones then spit us out reborn
26,1990,jurassic park,5,but now science is the belief system that is hundreds of years old and like the medieval system before it science is starting not to fit the world any more science has attained so much power that its practical limits begin to be apparent largely through science billions of us live in one small world densely packed and intercommunicating but science cannot help us decide what to do with that world or how to live science can make a nuclear reactor but it cannot tell us not to build it science can make pesticide but cannot tell us not to use it and our world starts to seem polluted in fundamental ways air and water and land because of ungovernable science

29,1991,sophies world,5,w you must choose are you a child who has not yet become world weary or are you a philosopher who will vow never to become so to children the world and everything in it is new something that gives rise to astonishment it is not like that for adults most adults accept the world as a matter of course this is precisely where philosophers are a notable exception a philosopher never gets quite used to the world to him or her the world continues to seem a bit unreasonable bewildering even enigmatic philosophers and small children thus have an important faculty in common the only thing we require to be good philosophers is the faculty of won

31,1985,the hand maids tale,5,falling in love we said i fell for him we were falling women we believed in it this downward motion so lovely like flying and yet at the same time so dire so extreme so unlikely god is love they once said but we reversed that and love like heaven was always just around the corner the more difficult it was to love the particular man beside us the more we believed in love abstract and total we were waiting always for the incarnation that word made flesh and sometimes it happened for a time that kind of love comes and goes and is hard to remember afterwards like pain you would look at the man one day and you would think i loved you and the tense would be past and you would be filled with a sense of wonder because it was such an amazing and precarious and dumb thing to have done and you would know too why your friends had been evasive about it at the time

expect from a free efficient and equal government state of the union address george washington december fellow citizens of the senate and house of representatives in meeting you again i feel much satisfaction in being able to repeat my congratulations on the favorable prospects which continue to distinguish our public affairs the abundant fruits of another year have blessed our country with plenty and with the means of a flourishing commerce the progress of public credit is witnessed by a considerable rise of american stock abroad as well as at home and the revenues allotted for this and other national purposes have been productive beyond the calculations by which they were regulated this latter circumstance is the more pleasing as it is not only a proof of the fertility of our resources but as it assures us of a further increase of the national respectability and credit and let me add as it bears an honorable testimony to the patriotism and integrity of the mercantile and marine part of our citizens the punctuality of the former in discharging their engagements has been exemplary in conformity to the powers vested in me by acts of the last session a loan of florins toward which some provisional measures had previously taken place has been completed in holland as well the celerity with which it has been filled as the nature of the terms considering the more than ordinary demand for borrowing created by the situation of europe give a reasonable hope that the further execution of those powers may proceed with advantage and success the secretary of the treasury has my directions to communicate such further particulars as may be requisite for more precise information since your last sessions i have received communications by which it appears that the district of kentucky at present a part of virginia has concurred in certain propositions contained in a law of that state in consequence of which the district is to become a distinct member of the union in case the requisite sanction of congress be added for this sanction application is now made i shall cause the papers on this very transaction to be laid before you the liberality and harmony with which it has been conducted will be found to do great honor to both the parties and the sentiments of warm attachment to the union and its present government expressed by our fellow citizens of kentucky can not fail to add an affectionate concern for their particular welfare to the great national impressions under which you will decide on the case submitted to you it has been heretofore known to congress that frequent incursions have been made on our frontier settlements by certain banditti of indians from the northwest side of the ohio these with some of the tribes dwelling on and near the wabash have of late been particularly active in their depredations and being emboldened by the impunity of their crimes and aided by such parts of the neighboring tribes as could be seduced to join in their hostilities or afford them a retreat for their prisoners and plunder they have instead of listening to the humane invitations and overtures made on the part of the united states renewed their violences with fresh alacrity and greater effect the lives of a number of valuable citizens have thus been sacrificed and some of them under circumstances peculiarly shocking whilst others have been carried into a deplorable captivity these aggravated provocations rendered it essential to the safety of the western settlements that the aggressors should be made sensible that the government of the union is not less capable of punishing their crimes than it is disposed to respect their rights and reward their attachments as this object could not be effected by defensive measures it became necessary to put in force the act which empowers the president to call out the militia for the protection of the frontiers and i have accordingly authorized an expedition in which the regular troops in that quarter are combined with such drafts of militia as were deemed sufficient the event of the measure is yet unknown to me the secretary of war is directed to lay before you a statement of the information on which it is founded as well as an estimate of the expense with which it will be attended the disturbed situation of europe and particularly the critical posture of the great maritime powers whilst it ought to make us the more thankful for the general peace and security enjoyed by the united states reminds us at the same time of the circumspection with which it becomes us to preserve these blessings it requires also that we should not overlook the tendency of a war and even of preparations for a war among the nations most concerned in active commerce with this country to abridge the means and thereby at least enhance the price of transporting its valuable productions to their markets i recommend it to your serious reflections how far and in what mode it may be expedient to guard against embarrassments from these contingencies by such encouragements to our own navigation as will render our commerce and agriculture less dependent on foreign bottoms which may

had to the full the independence the initiative which her woman was without or rather was without when acting for herself for when acting in the interests of her mistress amy was a different creature like all of defoe s principal characters roxana is eminently practical cold blooded and selfish after the first pang at parting with her five children she seldom thinks of them except as encumbrances she will provide for them as decently as she can without personal inconvenience but even a slight sacrifice for the sake of one of them is too much for her towards all the men with whom she has dealings and towards the friendly quakeress of the minories too she shows a calculating reticence which is most unfeminine the continuator of our story endowed the heroine with wholly characteristic selfishness when he made her on hearing of amy s death feel less sorrow for the miserable fate of her friend than for her own loss of an adviser and yet roxana is capable of fine feeling as is proved by those tears of joy for the happy change in her fortunes which bring about that realistic love scene between her and the prince in regard to the supposed paint on her cheeks again when shipwreck threatens her and amy her emotion and repentance are due as much to the thought that she has degraded amy to her own level as to thoughts of her more flagrant sins that she is capable of feeling gratitude she shows in her generosity to the quakeress and in her rage and remorse on suspecting that her daughter has been murdered and in her emotion several times on seeing her children roxana shows herself a true woman in short though for the most part monumentally selfish she is yet saved from being impossible by several displays of noble emotion one of the surprises to a student of defoe is that this thick skinned mercantile writer the vulgarest of all our great men of letters in the early eighteenth century seems to have known a woman s heart better than a man s at least he has succeeded in making two or three of his women characters more alive than any of his men it is another surprise that in writing of women defoe often seems ahead of his age in the argument between roxana and her dutch merchant about a woman s independence roxana talks like a character in a problem play or novel of our own day this perhaps is not to defoe s credit but it is to his credit that he has said elsewhere a woman well bred and well taught furnished with the accomplishments of knowledge and behaviour is a creature without comparison her society is the emblem of sublime enjoyments and the man that has such a one to his portion has nothing to do but to rejoice in her and be thankful after reading these words one cannot but regret that defoe did not try to create heroines more virtuous than moll flanders and roxana it is not only in drawing his characters that defoe in the fortunate mistress comes nearer than usual to producing a novel this narrative of his is less loosely constructed than any others except robinson crusoe and the journal of the plague year which it was easier to give structure to in both of them the story of a solitary on a desert island and the story of the visitation of a pestilence the nature of the subject made the author s course tolerably plain in the fortunate mistress the proper course was by no means so well marked the more credit is due defoe therefore that the book is so far from being entirely inorganised that had he taken sufficient pains with the ending it would have had as much structure as many good novels there is no strongly defined plot it is true but in general if a character is introduced he is heard from again a scene that impresses itself on the mind of the heroine is likely to be important in the sequel the story seems to be working itself out to a logical conclusion when unexpectedly it comes to an end defoe apparently grew tired of it for some reason and wound it up abruptly with only the meagre information as to the fate of roxana and amy that they fell into a dreadful course of calamities g h maynadier footnotes see memoirs of a cavalier an essay upon projects an academy for women author s preface the history of this beautiful lady is to speak for itself if it is not as beautiful as the lady herself is reported to be if it is not as diverting as the reader can desire and much more than he can reasonably expect and if all the most diverting parts of it are not adapted to the instruction and improvement of the reader the relator says it must be from the defect of his performance dressing up the story in worse clothes than the lady whose words he speaks prepared for the world he takes the liberty to say that this story differs from most of the modern performances of this kind though some of them have met with a very good reception in the world i say it differs from them in this great and essential article namely that the foundation of this is laid in truth of fact and so the work is not a story but a history the scene is laid so near the place where the main part of it was transacted that it was necessary to conceal names and persons lest what cannot be yet entirely forgot in that part of the town should be remembered and the facts traced back too plainly by the many people yet living who would know the persons by the particulars it is not always necessary that the names of persons should be discovered though the history may be many ways useful and if we should be always obliged to name the persons or not to relate the story the consequence might be only this that many a pleasant and delightful history would be buried in the dark and the world deprived both of the pleasure and the profit of it the writer says he was particularly acquainted with this lad

pamphlet as a contribution to criticism or critical theory defoe s comments upon specific writers are thoroughly conventional and commonplace as may be seen from a glance at his remarks about milton chaucer spenser shakespeare and others on p of more interest is his very high praise of dryden a man for learning and universal writing in poetry perhaps the greatest that england has produc d p l and his comment upon the critical detraction from which he suffered he compares pope interestingly enough with dryden remarking that pope a person tho inferior to mr dryden yet speaking impartially has few superiors in this age also is persecuted by envy and he has generous praise for that poet s translation of homer one may note that defoe avoids the shortcomings of the critics whom he condemns for judging according to party he distributes his praise indiscriminately between whig and tory writers in short his essay hardly does more than confirm the critical commonplaces of the time and attest to the catholicity of the author s taste of particular interest for students of defoe is the paragraph p l in which defoe defends the hack writers who must write for subsistence one should not expect their writings which are necessarily numerous to be as correct and finished as they might be after comparing their pens to prostitutes because of their venality he claims in a half ironic tone for both authors and booksellers the liberty of writing and printing for either or both sides without ignominy after all they must write and print to live such practice is certainly he observes no more unjust or disreputable than other ways of gaining wealth such as one finds in exchange alley this paragraph gains point when one remembers that defoe had served both whig and tory governments in as letters written to lord stanhope in that very year testify he was engaged in the perhaps dubious business of masquerading as a tory while actually in the service of the whig ministry to take the sting out of the more violent tory periodicals and he was much concerned with the danger of his ambiguous position in december of he had been identified as a writer for mist s weekly journal the leading tory paper and was subjected to growing attacks in the whig press one can hardly doubt that this paragraph is a thinly veiled defense of his own practice as a professional journalist it is no surprise to find the author of a vindication in discussing the qualifications of writers advocating the importance of genius and natural parts above mere learning he instances the author of the true born englishman and shakespeare the former characteriz d as a person of little learning but of prodigious natural parts and the latter having but a small share of literature the further example of the literary achievements of the fair sex who had of course no university education reminds one of defoe s championship elsewhere of women the business of a writer is to please and inform and the general implication is that genius is more necessary to this end than learning also characteristic of defoe is his emphasis upon the advantage to an author of conversation the aliment of genius the life of all airy performances p likewise his digression upon education pp f his charge that people of quality in england all too often neglect their children s education his remarks upon the advantages of travel and the need of training in the vernacular all will be familiar to readers of defoe a vindication of the press is chiefly important for the corroboration of our knowledge of daniel defoe it presents nothing that is new but it gives further evidence of his pride in authorship of his rationalization of his actions as a professional journalist and of his belief in the importance of a free press many of his characteristic ideas are repeated with his usual consistency in point of view although the critical comments in the essay are thoroughly conventional they offer evidence of contemporary literary judgments and reveal defoe as a well informed man of moderation and commonsense though certainly not as a profound critic in the catholicity of his tastes and interests defoe is far ahead of his puritan fellows and his essay may be taken as one indication of the growing interest of the middle classes for whom he wrote in the greater world of literature as professor trent remarks in his ms notes defoe rarely wrote a tract without introducing something worthy of attention and comment and the present pamphlet is no exception to the rule i should like to thank dr henry c

appearing to be a continuation of the same work and as such abridg d in the short chronicle it was thought proper to be added had the great author himself liv d to publish this work there would have been no occasion for this advertisement but as it is the reader is desired to allow for such imperfections as are inseparable from posthumous pieces and in so great a number of proper names to excuse some errors of the press that have escaped a short chronicle from the first memory of things in europe to the conquest of persia by alexander the great the introduction the greek antiquities are full of poetical fictions because the greeks wrote nothing in prose before the conquest of asia by cyrus the persian then pherecydes scyrius and cadmus milesius introduced the writing in prose pherecydes atheniensis about the end of the reign of darius hystaspis wrote of antiquities and digested his work by genealogies and was reckoned one of the best genealogers epimenides the historian proceeded also by genealogies and hellanicus who was twelve years older than herodotus digested his history by the ages or successions of the priestesses of juno argiva others digested theirs by the kings of the laced monians or archons of athens hippias the elean about thirty years before the fall of the persian empire published a breviary or list of the olympic victors and about ten years before the fall thereof ephorus the disciple of isocrates formed a chronological history of greece beginning with the return of the heraclides into peloponnesus and ending with the siege of perinthus in the twentieth year of philip the father of alexander the great but he digested things by generations and the reckoning by olympiads was not yet in use nor doth it appear that the reigns of kings were yet set down by numbers of years the arundelian marbles were composed sixty years after the death of alexander the great an olymp and yet mention not the olympiads but in the next olympiad tim us siculus published an history in several books down to his own times according to the olympiads comparing the ephori the kings of sparta the archons of athens and the priestesses of argos with the olympic victors so as to make the olympiads and the genealogies and successions of kings archons and priestesses and poetical histories suit with one another according to the best of his judgment and where he left off polybius began and carried on the history so then a little after the death of alexander the great they began to set down the generations reigns and successions in numbers of years and by putting reigns and successions equipollent to generations and three generations to an hundred or an hundred and twenty years as appears by their chronology they have made the antiquities of greece

ca ira something to distract the minds of the populace from the consequences of its own deeds and the helplessness of its legislators procureur chaumette enlarged upon his original idea like a true artist who sees the broad effect of a picture at a glance and then fills in the minute details he was already busy elaborating his scheme the goddess must be beautiful not too young reason can only go hand in hand with the riper age of second youth she must be decked out in classical draperies severe yet suggestive she must be rouged and painted for she is a mere idol easily to be appeased with incense music and laughter he was getting deeply interested in his subject seeking minutiae of detail with which to render his theme more and more attractive but patience was never the characteristic of the revolutionary government of france the national assembly soon tired of chaumette s dithyrambic utterances up aloft on the mountain danton was yawning like a gigantic leopard soon henriot was on his feet he had a far finer scheme than that of the procureur to place before his colleagues a grand national fete semi religious in character but of the new religion which destroyed and desecrated and never knelt in worship citizen chaumette s goddess of reason by all means henriot conceded that the idea was a good one but the goddess merely as a figure head around her a procession of unfrocked and apostate priests typifying the destruction of ancient hierarchy mules carrying loads of sacred vessels the spoils of ten thousand churches of france and ballet girls in bacchanalian robes dancing the carmagnole around the new deity public prosecutor foucquier tinville thought all these schemes very tame why should the people of france be led to think that the era of a new religion would mean an era of milk and water of pageants and of fireworks let every man woman and child know that this was an era of blood and again of blood oh he exclaimed in passionate accents would that all the traitors in france had but one head that it might be cut off with one blow of the guillotine he approved of the national fete but he desired an apotheosis of the guillotine he undertook to find ten thousand traitors to be beheaded on one grand and glorious day ten thousand heads to adorn the place de la revolution on a great never to be forgotten evening after the guillotine had accomplished this record work but collot d herbois would also have his say collot lately hailed from the south with a reputation for ferocity unparalleled throughout the whole of this horrible decade he would not be outdone by tinville s bloodthirsty schemes he was the inventor of the noyades which had been so successful at lyons and marseilles why not give the inhabitants of paris one of these exhilarating spectacles he asked with a coarse brutal laugh then he explained his invention of which he was inordinately proud some two or three hundred traitors men women and children tied securely together with ropes in great human bundles and thrown upon a barge in the middle of the river the barge with a hole in her bottom not too large only sufficient to cause her to sink slowly very slowly in sight of the crowd of delighted spectators the cries of the women and children and even of the men as they felt the waters rising and gradually enveloping them as they felt themselves powerless even for a fruitless struggle had proved most exhilarating so citizen collot declared to the hearts of the true patriots of lyons thus the discussion continued this was the era when every man had but one desire that of outdoing others in ferocity and brutality and but one care that of saving his own head by threatening that of his neighbour the great duel between the titanic leaders of these turbulent parties the conflict between hot headed danton on the one side and cold blooded robespierre on the other had only just begun the great all devouring monsters had dug their claws into one another but the issue of the combat was still at stake neither of these two giants had taken part in these deliberations anent the new religion and the new goddess danton gave signs now and then of the greatest impatience and muttered something about a new form of tyranny a new kind of oppression on the left robespierre in immaculate sea green coat and carefully gauffered linen was quietly polishing the nails of his right hand against the palm of his left but nothing escaped him of what was going on his ferocious egoism his unbounded ambition was even now calculating what advantages to himself might accrue from this idea of the new religion and of the national fete what personal aggrandisement he could derive therefrom the matter outwardly seemed trivial enough but already his keen and calculating mind had seen various side issues which might tend to place him robespierre on a yet higher and more unassailable pinnacle surrounded by those who hated him those who envied and those who feared him he ruled over them all by the strength of his own cold blooded savagery by the resistless power of his merciless cruelty he cared about nobody but himself about nothing but his own exaltation every action of his career since he gave up his small practice in a quiet provincial town in order to throw himself into the wild vortex of revolutionary politics every word he ever uttered had but one aim himself he saw his colleagues and comrades of the old jacobin clubs ruthlessly destroyed around him friends he had none and all left him indifferent and now he had hundreds of enemies

have been a good one because in order to know human things beforehand you use preternatural mediums which destroy the goodness of the courses which nature herself was taking for you and annexes to them diabolical influences which commonly carry along with them fatalities in this world as well as the next you will therefore give me your pardon likewise ladies if i relate some other of these practices which bare relation of itself after what i have said before seems to me sufficient to explode them another of the nurse s prescriptions is this upon a st agnes s night the st day of january take a row of pins and pull out every one one after another saying a pater noster or our father sticking a pin in your sleeve and you will dream of her you shall marry ben johnson in one of his masks makes some mention of this and on sweet agnes night please you with the promis d sight some of husbands some of lovers which an empty dream discovers now what can be more infinitely profane than to use the prayer our lord instituted in such a way there is another prescription which is as follows you must lie in another county and knit the left garter about the right legged stocking let the other garter and stocking alone and as you rehearse these following verses at every comma knit a knot this knot i knit to know the thing i know not yet that i may see the man that shall my husband be how he goes and what he wears and what he does all days and years accordingly in your dream you will see him if a musician with a lute or other instrument if a scholar with a book c now i appeal to you ladies what a ridiculous prescription is this but yet as slight a thing as it is it may be of great importance if it be brought about because then it must be construed to be done by preternatural means and then those words are nothing less than an application to the devil mr aubrey of the royal society says a gentlewoman that he knew confessed in his hearing that she used this method and dreamt of her husband whom she had never seen about two or three years after as she was one sunday at church up pops a young oxonian in the pulpit she cries out presently to her sister this is the very face of the man i saw in my dream sir william somes s lady did the like another way is to charm the moon thus as the old nurses give out at the first appearance of the moon after new year s day some say any other new moon is as good go out in the evening and stand over the spars of a gate or stile looking on the moon here remark that in yorkshire they kneel on a ground fast stone and say all hail to the moon all hail to thee i prithee good moon reveal to me this night who my husband shall be you must presently after go to bed the aforesaid mr aubrey knew two gentlewomen that did thus when they were young maids and they had dreams of those that married them but a great many of the wittiest part of your sex laugh at these common superstitions but then they are apt to run into worse they give themselves up to the reading of the cabalistical systems of sylphs and gnomes and mandrakes which are very wicked and delusive imaginations i would not have you imagine ladies that i impute these things as infirmities and frailties peculiar to your sex no men and great men too and scholars and even statesmen and princes themselves have been tainted with superstitions and where they infect the minds of such great personages they make the deeper impression according to the stronger and more manly ideas they have of them their greater degree of strength in the intellect only subjects them to greater weaknesses such was even the great paracelsus the wonder and miracle of learning in the age wherein he lived and such were all his followers scholars statesmen divines and princes that are talismanists these talismans that paracelsus pretends to owe to the excogitation and invention of honest art seem to me to be of a very diabolical nature and to owe their rise to being dedicated by the author to the heathen gods thus the cabalists pretending to a vast penetration into arts and sciences though all their thoughts are chimeras and extravagancies unless they be helped by preternatural means say they have found out the several methods appropriated to the several planets they have appropriated gold to the sun on the sunday silver to the moon on the monday iron to mars on the tuesday quicksilver to mercury on the wednesday tin to jupiter on the thursday copper or brass to venus on the friday and lead to saturn on the saturday the methods they take in forming these talismans are too long to dwell upon here but the properties which they pretend belong to them are that the first talisman or seal of the sun will make a man beloved by all princes and potentates and cause him to abound with all the riches his heart can wish the second preserves travellers from danger and is favourable to merchants tradesmen and workmen the third carries destruction to any place where it is put and it is said that a certain great minister of state ordered one of these to be carried into england in the times of the revolution of government caused by oliver cromwell the fourth

whether you have forsaken your sins and returned from your evil ways and answered the visitation of the love of god in your souls do you believe in the lord jesus christ who came to seek and to save them that were lost he is the physician of value that was wounded to heal our wounds he was wounded for our transgressions bruised for our iniquities and had the chastisement of our peace upon him that by his stripes we might be healed it is he alone that could do this who is sufficient for these things the lord found out one that is sufficient he hath laid help upon one that is mighty that is able to save to the uttermost all that come unto god by him god hath given him the spirit without measure and filled him with grace and truth that of his fullness we might all receive and grace for grace he is mighty to save the sons and daughters of men and to give them power to become the children of god this was testified of old john i but as many as received him to them gave he power to become the sons of god even to them who believe on his name men want power over their sins when sin appears to be exceeding sinful they would overcome it and be rid of it when it is troublesome and when they are under a deep conviction of the evil of it and see the woful and miserable state that sin hath brought mankind into how they have lost the image of god and the favour of god they then desire to be restored and brought back again into their primitive state you that know the truth of god see how the work goes on in your hearts see how the image of god is carrying on upon you consider that the lord is a holy god of purer eyes than to behold iniquity with approbation there is no peace to the wicked that walk in the broad way and grieve the holy spirit and do not answer his divine call there is a two fold call concerning man a call to repentance and a call to judgment the call to repentance is in this day of god s visitation they that receive it now that are so wise as to answer god s call and believe in the son of god and in his inward appearance that obey his voice when they hear his call saying come away come out of thy sins come out of the wickedness filthiness and pollution of the world come into the divine nature of the son of god come into his life into what life into the spiritual life the divine life thou hast been dead to god and alive to the world now that thou mayst sic be dead to sin and alive to god come unto him that hath all power in heaven and in earth committed to him o come unto christ the dear and blessed son of god in this day of grace and salvation and receive power to overcome thy sins then thou wilt be a conqueror and overcome the devil we are of ourselves altogether insufficient for these things we are weak and impotent and our saviour hath told us without me ye can do nothing we are justified freely by god s grace through the redemption that is in jesus christ not justified by our own works how great a contradiction is it to charge them with the contrary that say they cannot preach nor pray but as the spirit of god moveth them blessed be god that hath made us sensible of our own weakness emptiness and poverty our help hath been in the name of the lord who made heaven and earth who hath given his son to be an helper and an all sufficient saviour to us with him he hath given sufficient power and strength whereby we are enabled to overcome the devil the enemy of our souls so that we may be enabled to stand against principalities and powers against spiritual wickedness and conquer all the powers of darkness and fight the good fight of faith and finish our course with joy and keep the faith seeing there is laid up for us a crown of righteousness which the lord the righteous judge shall give us at that day and not only to us saith the apostle but unto all them that love his appearing we have not an high priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities but was in all points tempted like as we are yet without sin christ our redeemer was tempted that he might succour those that are tempted when the devil tempted our saviour in the wilderness and could not prevail he went away and left him the prince of this world found nothing in him upon which he could fasten his temptation christ will enable those that believe in him to overcome the devil and to be more than conquerors through him that loved them he came into the world to purge and purify his people and to be the author of eternal salvation to all them that believe in him and obey him but it is said he did not many mighty works among some to whom he preached the everlasting gospel because of their unbelief many will not believe in the inward and spiritual appearance of jesus christ the son of god who is the light of the world they will neither believe in the light nor walk in the light which will enable them to conquer the evil one who is the prince of darkness it is only through christ jesus the great captain of our salvation that we are victorious therefore my friends open your hearts to the lord jesus christ receive this blessed gift of god which he offers to you and can god give you a greater gift than the son of his love and will not you gladly receive him and that great salvation which he hath purchased for you with his own blood but say some people we have received christ and believe in him and believe

107,1792,the vindication of woman,1,urely there can be but one rule of right if morality has an eternal foundation and whoever sacrifices virtue strictly so called to present convenience or whose duty it is to act in such a manner lives only for the passing day and cannot be an accountable creature the poet then should have dropped his sneer when he says if weak women go astray the stars are more in fault than they for that they are bound by the adamantine chain of destiny is most certain if it be proved that they are never to exercise their own reason never to be independent never to rise above opinion or to feel the dignity of a rational will that only bows to god and often forgets that the universe contains any being but itself and the model of perfection to which its ardent gaze is turned to adore attributes that softened into virtues may be imitated in kind though the degree overwhelms the enraptured mind

amendment by precept or example and so it has proved for instead of seeing a full stop put to all abuses and corruptions at least in this little island as i had reason to expect behold after above six months warning i cannot learn that my book has produced one single effect according to my intentions i desired you would let me know by a letter when party and faction were extinguished judges learned and upright pleaders honest and modest with some tincture of common sense and smithfield blazing with pyramids of law books the young nobility x x s education entirely changed the physicians banished the female yahoos abounding in virtue honour truth and good sense courts and levees of great ministers thoroughly weeded and swept wit merit and learning rewarded all disgracers of the press in prose and verse condemned to eat nothing but their own cotton and quench their thirst with their own ink these and a thousand other reformations i firmly counted upon by your encouragement as indeed they were plainly deducible from the precepts delivered in my book and it must be owned that seven months were a sufficient time to correct every vice and folly to which yahoos are subject if their natures had been capable of the least disposition to virtue or wisdom yet so far have you been from answering my expectation in any of your letters that on the contrary you are loading our carrier every week with libels and keys and reflections and memoirs and second parts wherein i see myself accused of reflecting upon great state folk of degrading human nature for so they have still the confidence to style it and of abusing the female sex i find likewise that the writers of those bundles are not agreed among themselves for some of them will not allow me to be the author of my own travels and others make me author of books to which i am wholly a stranger i find likewise that your printer has been so careless as to confound the times and mistake the dates of my several voyages and returns neither assigning the true year nor the true month nor day of the month and i hear the original manuscript is all destroyed since the publication of my book neither have i any copy left however i have sent you some corrections which you may insert if ever there should be a second edition and yet i cannot stand to them but shall leave that matter to my judicious and candid readers to adjust it as they please i hear some of our sea yahoos find fault with my sea language as not proper in many parts nor now in use i cannot help it in my first voyages while i was young i was instructed by the oldest mariners and learned to speak as they did but i have since found that the sea yahoos are apt like the land ones to become new fangled in their words which the latter change every year insomuch as i remember upon each return to my own country their old dialect was so altered that i could hardly understand the new and i observe when any yahoo comes from london out of curiosity to visit me at my house we neither of us are able to deliver our conceptions in a manner intelligible to the other if the censure of the yahoos could any way affect me i should have great reason to complain that some of them are so bold as to think my book of travels a mere fiction out of mine own brain and have gone so far as to drop hints that the houyhnhnms and yahoos have no more existence than the inhabitants of utopia indeed i must confess that as to the people of lilliput brobdingrag for so the word should have been spelt and not erroneously brobdingnag and laputa i have never yet heard of any yahoo so presumptuous as to dispute their being or the facts i have related concerning them because the truth immediately strikes every reader with conviction and is there less probability in my account of the houyhnhnms or yahoos when it is manifest as to the latter there are so many thousands even in this country who only differ from their brother brutes in houyhnhnmland because they use a sort of jabber and do not go naked i wrote for their amendment and not their approbation the united praise of the whole race would be of less consequence to me than the neighing of those two degenerate houyhnhnms i keep in my stable because from these degenerate as they are i still improve in some virtues without any mixture of vice do these miserable animals presume to think that i am so degenerated as to defend my veracity yahoo as i am it is well known through all houyhnhnmland that by the instructions and example of my illustrious master i was able in the compass of two years although i confess with the utmost difficulty to remove that infernal habit of lying shuffling deceiving and equivocating so deeply rooted in the very souls of all my species especially the europeans i have other complaints to make upon this vexatious occasion but i forbear troubling myself or you any further i must freely confess that since my last return some corruptions of my yahoo nature have revived in me by conversing with a few of your species and particularly those of my own family by an unavoidable necessity else i should never have attempted so absurd a project as that of reforming the yahoo race in this kingdom but i have now done with all such visionary schemes for ever april part i a voyage to lilliput chapter i the author gives some account of himself and family his first

separated at the outset i never saw him when we forded the river when we planted the english flag in the first breach when we crossed the ditch beyond and fighting every inch of our way entered the town it was only at dusk when the place was ours and after general baird himself had found the dead body of tippoo under a heap of the slain that herncastle and i met we were each attached to a party sent out by the general s orders to prevent the plunder and confusion which followed our conquest the camp followers committed deplorable excesses and worse still the soldiers found their way by a guarded door into the treasury of the palace and loaded themselves with gold and jewels it was in the court outside the treasury that my cousin and i met to enforce the laws of discipline on our own soldiers herncastle s fiery temper had been as i could plainly see exasperated to a kind of frenzy by the terrible slaughter through which we had passed he was very unfit in my opinion to perform the duty that had been entrusted to him there was riot and confusion enough in the treasury but no violence that i saw the men if i may use such an expression disgraced themselves good humouredly all sorts of rough jests and catchwords were bandied about among them and the story of the diamond turned up again unexpectedly in the form of a mischievous joke who s got the moonstone was the rallying cry which perpetually caused the plundering as soon as it was stopped in one place to break out in another while i was still vainly trying to establish order i heard a frightful yelling on the other side of the courtyard and at once ran towards the cries in dread of finding some new outbreak of the pillage in that direction i got to an open door and saw the bodies of two indians by their dress as i guessed officers of the palace lying across the entrance dead a cry inside hurried me into a room which appeared to serve as an armoury a third indian mortally wounded was sinking at the feet of a man whose back was towards me the man turned at the instant when i came in and i saw john herncastle with a torch in one hand and a dagger dripping with blood in the other a stone set like a pommel in the end of the dagger s handle flashed in the torchlight as he turned on me like a gleam of fire the dying indian sank to his knees pointed to the dagger in herncastle s hand and said in his native language the moonstone will have its vengeance yet on you and yours he spoke those words and fell dead on the floor before i could stir in the matter the men who had followed me across the courtyard crowded in my cousin rushed to meet them like a madman clear the room he shouted to me and set a guard on the door the men fell back as he threw himself on them with his torch and his dagger i put two sentinels of my own company on whom i could rely to keep the door through the remainder of the night i saw no more of my cousin early in the morning the plunder still going on general baird announced publicly by beat of drum that any thief detected in the fact be he whom he might should be hung the provost marshal was in attendance to prove that the general was in earnest and in the throng that followed the proclamation herncastle and i met again he held out his hand as usual and said good morning i waited before i gave him my hand in return tell me first i said how the indian in the armoury met his death and what those last words meant when he pointed to the dagger in your hand the indian met his death as i suppose by a mortal wound said herncastle what his last words meant i know no more than you do i looked at him narrowly his frenzy of the previous day had all calmed down i determined to give him another chance is that all you have to tell me i asked he answered that is all i turned my back on him and we have not spoken since iv i beg it to be understood that what i write here about my cousin unless some necessity should arise for making it public is for the information of the family only herncastle has said nothing that can justify me in speaking to our commanding officer he has been taunted more than once about the diamond by those who recollect his angry outbreak before the assault but as may easily be imagined his own remembrance of the circumstances under which i surprised him in the armoury has been enough to keep him silent it is reported that he means to exchange into another regiment avowedly for the purpose of separating himself from me whether this be true or not i cannot prevail upon myself to become his accuser and i think with good reason if i made the matter public i have no evidence but moral evidence to bring forward i have not only no proof that he killed the two men at the door i cannot even declare that he killed the third man inside for i cannot say that my own eyes saw the deed committed it is true that i heard the dying indian s words but if those words were pronounced to be the ravings of delirium how could i contradict the assertion from my own knowledge let our relatives on either side form their own opinion on what i have written and decide for themselves whether the aversion i now feel towards this man is well or ill founded although i attach no sort of credit to the fantastic indian legend of the gem i must acknowledge before i conclude that i am influenced by a certain superstition of my own in this matter it is my conviction or my delusion no matter which that crime brings its own fatality with it i am not only persuaded of herncastle s guilt i am even fanciful enough to believe that he will live to regret it if he keeps the diamond and that others will live to regret taking it from him if he gives the diamond away

consider what state all men are naturally in and that is a state of perfect freedom to order their actions and dispose of their possessions and persons as they think fit within the bounds of the law

nothing more evident than that creatures of the same species and rank promiscuously born to all the same advantages of nature and the use of the same faculties should also be equal one amongst another

pamphlet as a contribution to criticism or critical theory defoe s comments upon specific writers are thoroughly conventional and commonplace as may be seen from a glance at his remarks about milton chaucer spenser shakespeare and others on p of more interest is his very high praise of dryden a man for learning and universal writing in poetry perhaps the greatest that england has produc d p l and his comment upon the critical detraction from which he suffered he compares pope interestingly enough with dryden remarking that pope a person tho inferior to mr dryden yet speaking impartially has few superiors in this age also is persecuted by envy and he has generous praise for that poet s translation of homer one may note that defoe avoids the shortcomings of the critics whom he condemns for judging according to party he distributes his praise indiscriminately between whig and tory writers in short his essay hardly does more than confirm the critical commonplaces of the time and attest to the catholicity of the author s taste of particular interest for students of defoe is the paragraph p l in which defoe defends the hack writers who must write for subsistence one should not expect their writings which are necessarily numerous to be as correct and finished as they might be after comparing their pens to prostitutes because of their venality he claims in a half ironic tone for both authors and booksellers the liberty of writing and printing for either or both sides without ignominy after all they must write and print to live such practice is certainly he observes no more unjust or disreputable than other ways of gaining wealth such as one finds in exchange alley this paragraph gains point when one remembers that defoe had served both whig and tory governments in as letters written to lord stanhope in that very year testify he was engaged in the perhaps dubious business of masquerading as a tory while actually in the service of the whig ministry to take the sting out of the more violent tory periodicals and he was much concerned with the danger of his ambiguous position in december of he had been identified as a writer for mist s weekly journal the leading tory paper and was subjected to growing attacks in the whig press one can hardly doubt that this paragraph is a thinly veiled defense of his own practice as a professional journalist it is no surprise to find the author of a vindication in discussing the qualifications of writers advocating the importance of genius and natural parts above mere learning he instances the author of the true born englishman and shakespeare the former characteriz d as a person of little learning but of prodigious natural parts and the latter having but a small share of literature the further example of the literary achievements of the fair sex who had of course no university education reminds one of defoe s championship elsewhere of women the business of a writer is to please and inform and the general implication is that genius is more necessary to this end than learning also characteristic of defoe is his emphasis upon the advantage to an author of conversation the aliment of genius the life of all airy performances p likewise his digression upon education pp f his charge that people of quality in england all too often neglect their children s education his remarks upon the advantages of travel and the need of training in the vernacular all will be familiar to readers of defoe a vindication of the press is chiefly important for the corroboration of our knowledge of daniel defoe it presents nothing that is new but it gives further evidence of his pride in authorship of his rationalization of his actions as a professional journalist and of his belief in the importance of a free press many of his characteristic ideas are repeated with his usual consistency in point of view although the critical comments in the essay are thoroughly conventional they offer evidence of contemporary literary judgments and reveal defoe as a well informed man of moderation and commonsense though certainly not as a profound critic in the catholicity of his tastes and interests defoe is far ahead of his puritan fellows and his essay may be taken as one indication of the growing interest of the middle classes for whom he wrote in the greater world of literature as professor trent remarks in his ms notes defoe rarely wrote a tract without introducing something worthy of attention and comment and the present pamphlet is no exception to the rule i should like to thank dr henry c

now of his son the lord castlemain of which hereafter went over the same river which we now pass at ilford and passing that part of the great forest which we now call hainault forest came into that which is now the great road a little on this side the whalebone a place on the road so called because the rib bone of a great whale which was taken in the river thames the same year that oliver cromwell died was fixed there for a monument of that monstrous creature it being at first about eight and twenty feet long according to my first intention of effectually viewing the sea coast of these three counties i went from stratford to barking a large market town but chiefly inhabited by fishermen whose smacks ride in the thames at the mouth of their river from whence their fish is sent up to london to the market at billingsgate by small boats of which i shall speak by itself in my description of london one thing i cannot omit in the mention of these barking fisher smacks viz that one of those fishermen a very substantial and experienced man convinced me that all the pretences to bringing fish alive to london market from the north seas and other remote places on the coast of great britain by the new built sloops called fish pools have not been able to do anything but what their fishing smacks are able on the same occasion to perform these fishing smacks are very useful vessels to the public upon many occasions as particularly in time of war they are used as press smacks running to all the northern and western coasts to pick up seamen to man the navy when any expedition is at hand that requires a sudden equipment at other times being excellent sailors they are tenders to particular men of war and on an expedition they have been made use of as machines for the blowing up of fortified ports and havens as at calais st malo and other places this parish of barking is very large and by the improvement of lands taken in out of the thames and out of the river which runs by the town the tithes as the townsmen assured me are worth above pounds per annum including small tithes note this parish has two or three chapels of ease viz one at ilford and one on the side of hainault forest called new chapel sir thomas fanshaw of an ancient roman catholic family has a very good estate in this parish a little beyond the town on the road to dagenham stood a great house ancient and now almost fallen down where tradition says the gunpowder treason plot was at first contrived and that all the first consultations about it were held there this side of the county is rather rich in land than in inhabitants occasioned chiefly by the unhealthiness of the air for these low marsh grounds which with all the south side of the county have been saved out of the river thames and out of the sea where the river is wide enough to be called so begin here or rather begin at west ham by stratford and continue to extend themselves from hence eastward growing wider and wider till we come beyond tilbury when the flat country lies six seven or eight miles broad and is justly said to be both unhealthy and unpleasant however the lands are rich and as is observable it is very good farming in the marshes because the landlords let good pennyworths for it being a place where everybody cannot live those that venture it will have encouragement and indeed it is but reasonable they should several little observations i made in this part of the county of essex we saw passing from barking to dagenham the famous breach made by an inundation of the thames which was so great as that it laid near acres of land under water but which after near ten years lying under water and being several times blown up has been at last effectually stopped by the application of captain perry the gentleman who for several years had been employed in the czar of muscovy s works at veronitza on the river don this breach appeared now effectually made up and they assured us that the new work where the breach was is by much esteemed the strongest of all the sea walls in that level it was observable that great part of the lands in these levels especially those on this side east tilbury are held by the farmers cow keepers and grazing butchers who live in and near london and that they are generally stocked all the winter half year with large fat sheep viz lincolnshire and leicestershire wethers which they buy in smithfield in september and october when the lincolnshire and leicestershire graziers sell off their stock and are kept here till christmas or candlemas or thereabouts and though they are not made at all fatter here than they were when bought in yet the farmer or butcher finds very good advantage in it by the difference of the price of mutton between michaelmas when it is cheapest and candlemas when it is dearest this is what the butchers value themselves upon when they tell us at the market that it is right marsh mutton in the bottom of these marshes and close to the edge of the river stands the strong fortress of tilbury called tilbury fort which may justly be looked upon as the key of the river thames and consequently the key of the city of london it is a regular fortification the design of it was a pentagon but the water bastion as it would have been called was never built the plan was laid out by sir martin beckman chief engineer to

put us into an imperfect state where we have perpetual occasion of each other s assistance there is none so low as not to be in a capacity of assisting the highest nor so high as not to want the assistance of the lowest it plainly appears from what hath been said that no one human creature is more worthy than another in the sight of god further than according to the goodness or holiness of their lives and that power wealth and the like outward advantages are so far from being the marks of god s approving or preferring those on whom they are bestowed that on the contrary he is pleased to suffer them to be almost engrossed by those who have least title to his favour now according to this equality wherein god hath placed all mankind with relation to himself you will observe that in all the relations between man and man there is a mutual dependence whereby the one cannot subsist without the other thus no man can be a prince without subjects nor a master without servants nor a father without children and this both explains and confirms the doctrine of the text for where there is a mutual dependence there must be a mutual duty and consequently a mutual subjection for instance the subject must obey his prince because god commands it human laws require it and the safety of the public makes it necessary for the same reasons we must obey all that are in authority and submit ourselves not only to the good and gentle but also to the froward whether they rule according to our liking or not on the other side in those countries that pretend to freedom princes are subject to those laws which their people have chosen they are bound to protect their subjects in liberty property and religion to receive their petitions and redress their grievances so that the best prince is in the opinion of wise men only the greatest servant of the nation not only a servant to the public in general but in some sort to every man in it in the like manner a servant owes obedience and diligence and faithfulness to his master from whom at the same time he hath a just demand for protection and maintenance and gentle treatment nay even the poor beggar hath a just demand of an alms from the rich man who is guilty of fraud injustice and oppression if he does not afford relief according to his abilities but this subjection we all owe one another is nowhere more necessary than in the common conversations of life for without it there could be no society among men if the learned would not sometimes submit to the ignorant the wise to the simple the gentle to the froward the old to the weaknesses of the young there would be nothing but everlasting variance in the world this our saviour himself confirmed by his own example for he appeared in the form of a servant and washed his disciples feet adding those memorable words ye call me lord and master and ye say well for so i am if i then your lord and master wash your feet how much more ought ye to wash one another s feet under which expression of washing the feet is included all that subjection assistance love and duty which every good christian ought to pay his brother in whatever station god hath placed him for the greatest prince and the meanest slave are not by infinite degrees so distant as our saviour and those disciples whose feet he vouchsafed to wash and although this doctrine of subjecting ourselves to one another may seem to grate upon the pride and vanity of mankind and may therefore be hard to be digested by those who value themselves upon their greatness or their wealth yet it is really no more than what most men practise upon other occasions for if our neighbour who is our inferior comes to see us we rise to receive him we place him above us and respect him as if he were better than ourselves and this is thought both decent and necessary and is usually called good manners now the duty required by the apostle is only that we should enlarge our minds and that what we thus practise in the common course of life we should imitate in all our actions and proceedings whatsoever since our saviour tells us that every man is our neighbour and since we are so ready in point of civility to yield to others in our own houses where only we have any title to govern having thus shown you what sort of subjection it is which all men owe one another and in what manner it ought to be paid i shall now draw some observations from what hath been said and first a thorough practice of this duty of subjecting ourselves to the wants and infirmities of each other would utterly extinguish in us the vice of pride for if god has pleased to intrust me with a talent not for my own sake but for the service of others and at the same time hath left me full of wants and necessities which others must supply i can then have no cause to set any extraordinary value upon myself or to despise my brother because he hath not the same talents which were lent to me his being may probably be as useful to the public as mine and therefore by the rules of right reason i am in no sort preferable to him secondly it is very manifest from what has been said that no man ought to look upon the advantages of life such as riches honour power and the like as his property but merely as a trust which god hath deposited with him to be employed for the use of his brethren and god will certainly punish the breach of that trust though the laws of man will not or rather indeed cannot because the trust was conferred only by god who has not left it to any power on earth to decide infallibly whether a man makes a good use of his talents or not or to punish him where he fails and therefore god seems to have more particularly taken this matter into his own hands and will most certainly reward or punish

tribes were captivated a priest or the captivity was sent back to bethel by order of the king of assyria to instruct the new inhabitants of samaria in the manner of the god of the land and the samaritans had the pentateuch from this priest as containing the law or manner of the god of the land which he was to teach them for they persevered in the religion which he taught them joining with it the worship of their own gods and by persevering in what they had been taught they preserved this book of their law in the original character of the hebrews while the two tribes after their return from babylon changed the character to that of the chaldees which they had learned at babylon and since the pentateuch was received as the book of the law both by the two tribes and by the ten tribes it follows that they received it before they became divided into two kingdoms for after the division they received not laws from one another but continued at variance judah could not reclaim israel from the sin of jeroboam and israel could not bring judah to it the pentateuch therefore was the book of the law in the days of david and solomon the affairs of the tabernacle and temple were ordered by david and solomon according to the law of this book and david in the th psalm admonishing the people to give ear to the law of god means the law of this book for in describing how their forefathers kept it not he quotes many historical things out of the books of exodus and numbers the race of the kings of edom before there reigned any king over israel is set down in the book of genesis and therefore that book was not written entirely in the form now extant before the reign of saul the writer set down the race of those kings till his own time and therefore wrote before david conquered edom the pentateuch is composed of the law and the history of god s people together and the history hath been collected from several books such as were the history of the creation composed by moses gen ii the book of the generations of adam gen v i and the book of the wars of the lord num xxi this book of wars contained what was done at the red sea and in the journeying of israel thro the wilderness and therefore was begun by moses and joshua might carry it on to the conquest of canaan for joshua wrote some things in the book of the law of god josh xxiv and therefore might write his own wars in the book of wars those being the principal wars of god these were publick books and therefore not written without the authority of moses and joshua and samuel had leisure in the reign of saul to put them into the form of the books of moses and joshua now extant inserting into the book of genesis the race of the kings of edom until there reigned a king in israel the book of the judges is a continued history of the judges down to the death of sampson and therefore was compiled after his death out of the acts of the judges several things in this book are said to be done when there was no king in israel judg xvii xviii xix xxi and therefore this book was written after the beginning of the reign of saul when it was written the jebusites dwelt in jerusalem jud i and therefore it was written before the eighth year of david sam v and chron xi the books of moses joshua and judges contain one continued history down from the creation to the death of sampson where the pentateuch ends the book of joshua begins and where the book of joshua ends the book of judges begins therefore all these books have been composed out of the writings of moses joshua and other records by one and the same hand after the beginning of the reign of saul and before the eighth year of david and samuel was a sacred writer sam x acquainted with the history of moses and the judges sam xii and had leisure in the reign of saul and sufficient authority to compose these books he was a prophet and judged israel all the days of his life and was in the greatest esteem with the people and the law by which he was to judge the people was not to be published by less authority than his own the law maker being not inferior to the judge and the book of jasher which is quoted in the book of joshua josh x was in being at the death of saul sam i at the dedication of the temple of solomon when the ark was brought into the most holy place there was nothing in it but the two tables kings viii and therefore when the philistines took the ark they took out of it the book of the law and the golden pot of manna and aaron s rod and this and other losses in the desolation of israel by the conquering philistines might give occasion to samuel after some respite from those enemies to recollect the scattered writings of moses and joshua and the records of the patriarchs and judges and compose them in the form now extant the book of ruth is a history of things done in the days of the judges and may be looked upon as an addition to the book of the judges written by the same author and at the same time for it was written after the birth of david ruth iv and not long after because the history of boaz and ruth the great grandfather and great grandmother of david and that of their contemporaries could not well be remembered above two or three generations and since this book derives the genealogy of david from boaz and ruth and omits david s elder brothers and his sons it was written in honour

people it now ceased to be so almost completely with the support which such methods secured along with encouragement from his ministers the king was prepared to put in operation his policy for regulating the affairs of america writs of assistance were followed by the passage of the stamp act the ostensible object of both these measures was to help pay the debt incurred by the french war but the real purpose lay deeper and was nothing more or less than the ultimate extension of parliamentary rule in great things as well as small to america at this crisis so momentous for the colonists the rockingham ministry was formed and burke together with pitt supported a motion for the unconditional repeal of the stamp act after much wrangling the motion was carried and the first blunder of the mother country seemed to have been smoothed over only a few months elapsed however when the question of taxing the colonies was revived pitt lay ill and could take no part in the proposed measure through the influence of other members of his party notably townshend a series of acts were passed imposing duties on several exports to america this was followed by a suspension of the new york assembly because it had disregarded instructions in the matter of supplies for the troops the colonists were furious matters went from bad to worse to withdraw as far as possible without yielding the principle at stake the duties on all the exports mentioned in the bill were removed except that on tea but it was precisely the principle for which the colonists were contending they were not in the humor for compromise when they believed their freedom was endangered and the strength and determination of their resistance found a climax in the boston tea party in the meantime lord north who was absolutely obedient to the king had become prime minister five bills were prepared the tenor of which it was thought would overawe the colonists of these the boston port bill and the regulating act are perhaps the most famous though the ultimate tendency of all was blindly coercive while the king and his friends were busy with these the opposition proposed an unconditional repeal of the tea act the bill was introduced only to be overwhelmingly defeated by the same parliament that passed the five measures of lord north in america the effect of these proceedings was such as might have been expected by thinking men the colonies were as a unit in their support of massachusetts the regulating act was set at defiance public officers in the king s service were forced to resign town meetings were held and preparations for war were begun in dead earnest to avert this some of england s greatest statesmen pitt among the number asked for a reconsideration on february the first a bill was introduced which would have gone far toward bringing peace one month later burke delivered his speech on conciliation with the colonies edmund burke there is nothing unusual in burke s early life he was born in dublin ireland in his father was a successful lawyer and a protestant his mother a catholic at the age of twelve he became a pupil of abraham shackleton a quaker who had been teaching some fifteen years at ballitore a small town thirty miles from dublin in after years burke was always pleased to speak of his old friend in the kindest way if i am anything he declares it is the education i had there that has made me so and again at shackleton s death when burke was near the zenith of his fame and popularity he writes i had a true honor and affection for that excellent man i feel something like a satisfaction in the midst of my concern that i was fortunate enough to have him under my roof before his departure it can hardly be doubted that the old quaker schoolmaster succeeded with his pupil who was already so favorably inclined and it is more than probable that the daily example of one who lived out his precepts was strong in its influence upon a young and generous mind burke attended school at ballitore two years then at the age of fourteen he became a student at trinity college dublin and remained there five years at college he was unsystematic and careless of routine he seems to have done pretty much as he pleased and however methodical he became in after life his study during these five years was rambling and spasmodic the only definite knowledge we have of this period is given by burke himself in letters to his former friend richard shackleton son of his old schoolmaster what he did was done with a zest that at times became a feverish impatience first i was greatly taken with natural philosophy which while i should have given my mind to logic employed me incessantly this i call my furor mathematicus following in succession come his furor logicus furor historicus and furor peoticus each of which absorbed him for the time being it would be wrong however to think of burke as a trifler even in his youth he read in the library three hours every day and we may be sure he read as intelligently as eagerly it is more than probable that like a few other great minds he did not need a rigid system to guide him if he chose his subjects of study at pleasure there is every reason to believe he mastered them of intimate friends at the university we hear nothing goldsmith came one year later but there is no evidence that they knew each other it is probable that burke always reserved had little in common with his young associates his own musings with occasional attempts at writing poetry long walks through the country and frequent letters to and from richard shackleton employed him when not at his books two years after taking his degree burke went to london and established himself at the middle temple for the u

consideration and necessary to convey to you that information of the state of the union which it is my duty to afford the welfare of our country is the great object to which our cares and efforts ought to be directed and i shall derive great satisfaction from a cooperation with you in the pleasing though arduous task of insuring to our fellow citizens the blessings which they have a right to expect from a free efficient and equal government state of the union address george washington december fellow citizens of the senate and house of representatives in meeting you again i feel much satisfaction in being able to repeat my congratulations on the favorable prospects which continue to distinguish our public affairs the abundant fruits of another year have blessed our country with plenty and with the means of a flourishing commerce the progress of public credit is witnessed by a considerable rise of american stock abroad as well as at home and the revenues allotted for this and other national purposes have been productive beyond the calculations by which they were regulated this latter circumstance is the more pleasing as it is not only a proof of the fertility of our resources but as it assures us of a further increase of the national respectability and credit and let me add as it bears an honorable testimony to the patriotism and integrity of the mercantile and marine part of our citizens the punctuality of the former in discharging their engagements has been exemplary in conformity to the powers vested in me by acts of the last session a loan of florins toward which some provisional measures had previously taken place has been completed in holland as well the celerity with which it has been filled as the nature of the terms considering the more than ordinary demand for borrowing created by the situation of europe give a reasonable hope that the further execution of those powers may proceed with advantage and success the secretary of the treasury has my directions to communicate such further particulars as may be requisite for more precise information since your last sessions i have received communications by which it appears that the district of kentucky at present a part of virginia has concurred in certain propositions contained in a law of that state in consequence of which the district is to become a distinct member of the union in case the requisite sanction of congress be added for this sanction application is now made i shall cause the papers on this very transaction to be laid before you the liberality and harmony with which it has been conducted will be found to do great honor to both the parties and the sentiments of warm attachment to the union and its present government expressed by our fellow citizens of kentucky can not fail to add an affectionate concern for their particular welfare to the great national impressions under which you will decide on the case submitted to you it has been heretofore known to congress that frequent incursions have been made on our frontier settlements by certain banditti of indians from the northwest side of the ohio these with some of the tribes dwelling on and near the wabash have of late been particularly active in their depredations and being emboldened by the impunity of their crimes and aided by such parts of the neighboring tribes as could be seduced to join in their hostilities or afford them a retreat for their prisoners and plunder they have instead of listening to the humane invitations and overtures made on the part of the united states renewed their violences with fresh alacrity and greater effect the lives of a number of valuable citizens have thus been sacrificed and some of them under circumstances peculiarly shocking whilst others have been carried into a deplorable captivity these aggravated provocations rendered it essential to the safety of the western settlements that the aggressors should be made sensible that the government of the union is not less capable of punishing their crimes than it is disposed to respect their rights and reward their attachments as this object could not be effected by defensive measures it became necessary to put in force the act which empowers the president to call out the militia for the protection of the frontiers and i have accordingly authorized an expedition in which the regular troops in that quarter are combined with such drafts of militia as were deemed sufficient the event of the measure is yet unknown to me the secretary of war is directed to lay before you a statement of the information on which it is founded as well as an estimate of the expense with which it will be attended the disturbed situation of europe and particularly the critical posture of the great maritime powers whilst it ought to make us the more thankful for the general peace and security enjoyed by the united states reminds us at the same time of the circumspection with which it becomes us to preserve these blessings it requires also that we should not overlook the tendency of a war and even of preparations for a war among the nations most concerned in active commerce with this country to abridge the means and thereby at least enhance the price of transporting its valuable productions to their markets i recommend it to your serious reflections how far and in what mode it may be expedient to guard against embarrassments from these contingencies by such encouragements to our own navigation as will render our commerce and agriculture less dependent on foreign bottoms which may fail us in the very moments most interesting to both of th

these weeks although it was at a time of the year when usually the bills are very moderate the usual number of burials within the bills of mortality for a week was from about or thereabouts to the last was esteemed a pretty high bill but after this we found the bills successively increasing as follows buried increased december the th to the th th rd january january the rd th th th th th this last bill was really frightful being a higher number than had been known to have been buried in one week since the preceding visitation of however all this went off again and the weather proving cold and the frost which began in december still continuing very severe even till near the end of february attended with sharp though moderate winds the bills decreased again and the city grew healthy and everybody began to look upon the danger as good as over only that still the burials in st giles s continued high from the beginning of april especially they stood at twenty five each week till the week from the th to the th when there was buried in st giles s parish thirty whereof two of the plague and eight of the spotted fever which was looked upon as the same thing likewise the number that died of the spotted fever in the whole increased being eight the week before and twelve the week above named this alarmed us all again and terrible apprehensions were among the people especially the weather being now changed and growing warm and the summer being at hand however the next week there seemed to be some hopes again the bills were low the number of the dead in all was but there was none of the plague and but four of the spotted fever but the following week it returned again and the distemper was spread into two or three other parishes viz st andrew s holborn st clement danes and to the great affliction of the city one died within the walls in the parish of st mary woolchurch that is to say in bearbinder lane near stocks market in all there were nine of the plague and six of the spotted fever it was however upon inquiry found that this frenchman who died in bearbinder lane was one who having lived in long acre near the infected houses had removed for fear of the distemper not knowing that he was already infected this was the beginning of may yet the weather was temperate variable and cool enough and people had still some hopes that which encouraged them was that the city was healthy the whole ninety seven parishes buried but fifty four and we began to hope that as it was chiefly among the people at that end of the town it might go no farther and the rather because the next week which was from the th of may to the th there died but three of which not one within the whole city or liberties and st andrew s buried but fifteen which was very low tis true st giles s buried two and thirty but still as there was but one of the plague people began to be easy the whole bill also was very low for the week before the bill was but and the week above mentioned but we continued in these hopes for a few days but it was but for a few for the people were no more to be deceived thus they searched the houses and found that the plague was really spread every way and that many died of it every day so that now all our extenuations abated and it was no more to be concealed nay it quickly appeared that the infection had spread itself beyond all hopes of abatement that in the parish of st giles it was gotten into several streets and several families lay all sick together and accordingly in the weekly bill for the next week the thing began to show itself there was indeed but fourteen set down of the plague but this was all knavery and collusion for in st giles s parish they buried forty in all whereof it was certain most of them died of the plague though they were set down of other distempers and though the number of all the burials were not increased above thirty two and the whole bill being but yet there was fourteen of the spotted fever as well as fourteen of the plague and we took it for granted upon the whole that there were fifty died that week of the plague the next bill was from the rd of may to the th when the number of the plague was seventeen but the burials in st giles s were fifty three a frightful number of whom they set down but nine of the plague but on an examination more strictly by the justices of peace and at the lord mayor s request it was found there were twenty more who were really dead of the plague in that parish but had been set down of the spotted fever or other distempers besides others concealed but those were trifling things to what followed immediately after for now the weather set in hot and from the first week in june the infection spread in a dreadful manner and the bills rose high the articles of the fever spotted fever and teeth began to swell for all that could conceal their distempers did it to prevent their neighbours shunning and refusing to converse with them and also to prevent authority shutting up their houses which though it was not yet practised yet was threatened and people were extremely terrified at the thoughts of it the second week in june the parish of st giles

not only is the spirit of the institutions in harmony with these leases but so is the letter also men must draw a distinction between the spirit of the institutions and their own spirits the latter being often nothing more than a stomach that is not easily satisfied it would be just as true to affirm that domestic slavery is opposed to the institutions of the united states as to say the same of these leases it would be just as rational to maintain because a does not choose to make an associate of b that he is acting in opposition to the spirit of the institutions inasmuch as the declaration of independence advances the dogmas that men are born equal as it is to say it is opposed to the same spirit for b to pay rent to a according to his covenant it is pretended that the durable leases are feudal in their nature we do not conceive this to be true but admitting it to be so it would only prove that feudality to this extent is a part of the institutions of the state what is more it would become a part over which the state itself has conceded all power of control beyond that which it may remotely possess as one out of twenty eight communities as respects this feudal feature it is not easy to say where it must be looked for it is not to be found in the simple fact of paying rent for that is so general as to render the whole country feudal could it be true it cannot be in the circumstance that the rent is to be paid in kind as it is called and in labour for that is an advantage to the tenant by affording him the option since the penalty of a failure leaves the alternative of paying in money it must be therefore that these leases are feudal because they run for ever now the length of the lease is clearly a concession to the tenant and was so regarded when received and there is not probably a single tenant under lives who would not gladly exchange his term of possession for that of one of these detestable durable leases among the absurdities that have been circulated on this subject of feudality it has been pretended that the well known english statute of quia emptores has prohibited fines for alienation or that the quarter sales fifth sales sixth sales c of our own leases were contrary to the law of the realm when made under the common law in certain cases of feudal tenures the fines for alienation were an incident of the tenure the statute of quia emptores abolished that general principle but it in no manner forbade parties to enter into covenants of the nature of quarter sales did they see fit the common law gives all the real estate to the eldest son our statute divides the real estate among the nearest of kin without regard even to sex it might just as well be pretended that the father cannot devise all his lands to his eldest son under our statute as to say that the law of edward i prevents parties from bargaining for quarter sales altering a provision of the common law does not preclude parties from making covenants similar to its ancient provisions feudal tenures were originally divided into two great classes those which were called the military tenures or knight s service and soccage the first tenure was that which became oppressive in the progress of society soccage was of two kinds free and villian the first has an affinity to our own system as connected with these leases the last never existed among us at all when the knight s service or military tenures of england were converted into free soccage in the reign of charles ii the concession was considered of a character so favourable to liberty as to be classed among the great measures of the time one of which was the habeas corpus act the only feature of our own leases in the least approaching villian soccage is that of the day s works but every one acquainted with the habits of american life will understand that husbandmen in general throughout the northern states would regard it as an advantage to be able to pay their debts in this way and the law gives them an option since a failure to pay in kind or in work merely incurs the forfeiture of paying what the particular thing is worth in money in point of fact money has always been received for these day s works and at a stipulated price but it is pretended whatever may be the equity of these leasehold contracts they are offensive to the tenants and ought to be abrogated for the peace of the state the state is bound to make all classes of men respect its laws and in nothing more so than in the fulfilment of their legal contracts the greater the number of the offenders the higher the obligation to act with decision and efficiency to say that these disorganizers ought not to be put down is to say that crime is to obtain impunity by its own extent and to say that they cannot be put down under our form of government is a direct admission that the government is unequal to the discharge of one of the plainest and commonest obligations of all civilized society if this be really so the sooner we get rid of the present form of government the better the notion of remedying such an evil by concession is as puerile as it is dishonest the larger the concessions become the greater

the author to the heathen gods thus the cabalists pretending to a vast penetration into arts and sciences though all their thoughts are chimeras and extravagancies unless they be helped by preternatural means say they have found out the several methods appropriated to the several planets they have appropriated gold to the sun on the sunday silver to the moon on the monday iron to mars on the tuesday quicksilver to mercury on the wednesday tin to jupiter on the thursday copper or brass to venus on the friday and lead to saturn on the saturday the methods they take in forming these talismans are too long to dwell upon here but the properties which they pretend belong to them are that the first talisman or seal of the sun will make a man beloved by all princes and potentates and cause him to abound with all the riches his heart can wish the second preserves travellers from danger and is favourable to merchants tradesmen and workmen the third carries destruction to any place

not only is the spirit of the institutions in harmony with these leases but so is the letter also men must draw a distinction between the spirit of the institutions and their own spirits the latter being often nothing more than a stomach that is not easily satisfied it would be just as true to affirm that domestic slavery is opposed to the institutions of the united states as to say the same of these leases it would be just as rational to maintain because a does not choose to make an associate of b that he is acting in opposition to the spirit of the institutions inasmuch as the declaration of independence advances the dogmas that men are born equal as it is to say it is opposed to the same spirit for b to pay rent to a according to his covenant it is pretended that the durable leases are feudal in their nature we do not conceive this to be true but admitting it to be so it would only prove that feudality to this extent is a part of the institutions of the state what is more it would become a part over which the state itself has conceded all power of control beyond that which it may remotely possess as one out of twenty eight communities as respects this feudal feature it is not easy to say where it must be looked for it is not to be found in the simple fact of paying rent for that is so general as to render the whole country feudal could it be true it cannot be in the circumstance that the rent is to be paid in kind as it is called and in labour for that is an advantage to the tenant by affording him the option since the penalty of a failure leaves the alternative of paying in money it must be therefore that these leases are feudal because they run for ever now the length of the lease is clearly a concession to the tenant and was so regarded when received and there is not probably a single tenant under lives who would not gladly exchange his term of possession for that of one of these detestable durable leases among the absurdities that have been circulated on this subject of feudality it has been pretended that the well known english statute of quia emptores has prohibited fines for alienation or that the quarter sales fifth sales sixth sales c of our own leases were contrary to the law of the realm when made under the common law in certain cases of feudal tenures the fines for alienation were an incident of the tenure the statute of quia emptores abolished that general principle but it in no manner forbade parties to enter into covenants of the nature of quarter sales did they see fit the common law gives all the real estate to the eldest son our statute divides the real estate among the nearest of kin without regard even to sex it might just as well be pretended that the father cannot devise all his lands to his eldest son under our statute as to say that the law of edward i prevents parties from bargaining for quarter sales altering a provision of the common law does not preclude parties from making covenants similar to its ancient provisions feudal tenures were originally divided into two great classes those which were called the military tenures or knight s service and soccage the first tenure was that which became oppressive in the progress of society soccage was of two kinds free and villian the first has an affinity to our own system as connected with these leases the last never existed among us at all when the knight s service or military tenures of england were converted into free soccage in the reign of charles ii the concession was considered of a character so favourable to liberty as to be classed among the great measures of the time one of which was the habeas corpus act the only feature of our own leases in the least approaching villian soccage is that of the day s works but every one acquainted with the habits of american life will understand that husbandmen in general throughout the northern states would regard it as an advantage to be able to pay their debts in this way and the law gives them an option since a failure to pay in kind or in work merely incurs the forfeiture of paying what the particular thing is worth in money in point of fact money has always been received for these day s works and at a stipulated price but it is pretended whatever may be the equity of these leasehold contracts they are offensive to the tenants and ought to be abrogated for the peace of the state the state is bound to make all classes of men respect its laws and in nothing more so than in the fulfilment of their legal contracts the greater the number of the offenders the higher the obligation to act with decision and efficiency to say that these disorganizers ought not to be put down is to say that crime is to obtain impunity by its own extent and to say that they cannot be put down under our form of government is a direct admission that the government is unequal to the discharge of one of the plainest and commonest obligations of all civilized society if this be really so the sooner we get rid of the present form of government the better the notion of remedying such an evil by concession is as puerile as it is dishonest the larger the concessions become the greater will be the exactions of a cormorant cupidity as soon as quiet is obtained by these means in reference to the leasehold tenures it will be demanded by some fresh combination to attain some other end when lee told washington at monmouth sir your troops will not stand against british grenadiers washington is said to have answered sir you have never tried them the same reply might be given to those

ought to be directed and i shall derive great satisfaction from a cooperation with you in the pleasing though arduous task of insuring to our fellow citizens the blessings which they have a right to expect from a free efficient and equal government state of the union address george washington december fellow citizens of the senate and house of representatives in meeting you again i feel much satisfaction in being able to repeat my congratulations on the favorable prospects which continue to distinguish our public affairs the abundant fruits of another year have blessed our country with plenty and with the means of a flourishing commerce the progress of public credit is witnessed by a considerable rise of american stock abroad as well as at home and the revenues allotted for this and other national purposes have been productive beyond the calculations by which they were regulated this latter circumstance is the more pleasing as it is not only a proof of the fertility of our resources but as it assures us of a further increase of the national respectability and credit and let me add as it bears an honorable testimony to the patriotism and integrity of the mercantile and marine part of our citizens the punctuality of the former in discharging their engagements has been exemplary in conformity to the powers vested in me by acts of the last session a loan of florins toward which some provisional measures had previously taken place has been completed in holland as well the celerity with which it has been filled as the nature of the terms considering the more than ordinary demand for borrowing created by the situation of europe give a reasonable hope that the further execution of those powers may proceed with advantage and success the secretary of the treasury has my directions to communicate such further particulars as may be requisite for more precise information since your last sessions i have received communications by which it appears that the district of kentucky at present a part of virginia has concurred in certain propositions contained in a law of that state in consequence of which the district is to become a distinct member of the union in case the requisite sanction of congress be added for this sanction application is now made i shall cause the papers on this very transaction to be laid before you the liberality and harmony with which it has been conducted will be found to do great honor to both the parties and the sentiments of warm attachment to the union and its present government expressed by our fellow citizens of kentucky can not fail to add an affectionate concern for their particular welfare to the great national impressions under which you will decide on the case submitted to you it has been heretofore known to congress that frequent incursions have been made on our frontier settlements by certain banditti of indians from the northwest side of the ohio these with some of the tribes dwelling on and near the wabash have of late been particularly active in their depredations and being emboldened by the impunity of their crimes and aided by such parts of the neighboring tribes as could be seduced to join in their hostilities or afford them a retreat for their prisoners and plunder they have instead of listening to the humane invitations and overtures made on the part of the united states renewed their violences with fresh alacrity and greater effect the lives of a number of valuable citizens have thus been sacrificed and some of them under circumstances peculiarly shocking whilst others have been carried into a deplorable captivity these aggravated provocations rendered it essential to the safety of the western settlements that the aggressors should be made sensible that the government of the union is not less capable of punishing their crimes than it is disposed to respect their rights and reward their attachments as this object could not be effected by defensive measures it became necessary to put in force the act which empowers the president to call out the militia for the protection of the frontiers and i have accordingly authorized an expedition in which the regular troops in that quarter are combined with such drafts of militia as were deemed sufficient the event of the measure is yet unknown to me the secretary of war is directed to lay before you a statement of the information on which it is founded as well as an estimate of the expense with which it will be attended the disturbed situation of europe and particularly the critical posture of the great maritime powers whilst it ought to make us the more thankful for the general peace and security enjoyed by the united states reminds us at the same time of the circumspection with which it becomes us to preserve these blessings it requires also that we should not overlook the tendency of a war and even of preparations for a war among the nations most concerned in active commerce with this country to abridge the means and thereby at least enhance the price of transporting its valuable productions to their markets i recommend it to your serious reflections how far and in what mode it may be

now of his son the lord castlemain of which hereafter went over the same river which we now pass at ilford and passing that part of the great forest which we now call hainault forest came into that which is now the great road a little on this side the whalebone a place on the road so called because the rib bone of a great whale which was taken in the river thames the same year that oliver cromwell died was fixed there for a monument of that monstrous creature it being at first about eight and twenty feet long according to my first intention of effectually viewing the sea coast of these three counties i went from stratford to barking a large market town but chiefly inhabited by fishermen whose smacks ride in the thames at the mouth of their river from whence their fish is sent up to london to the market at billingsgate by small boats of which i shall speak by itself in my description of london one thing i cannot omit in the mention of these barking fisher smacks viz that one of those fishermen a very substantial and experienced man convinced me that all the pretences to bringing fish alive to london market from the north seas and other remote places on the coast of great britain by the new built sloops called fish pools have not been able to do anything but what their fishing smacks are able on the same occasion to perform these fishing smacks are very useful vessels to the public upon many occasions as particularly in time of war they are used as press smacks running to all the northern and western coasts to pick up seamen to man the navy when any expedition is at hand that requires a sudden equipment at other times being excellent sailors they are tenders to particular men of war and on an expedition they have been made use of as machines for the blowing up of fortified ports and havens as at calais st malo and other places this parish of barking is very large and by the improvement of lands taken in out of the thames and out of the river which runs by the town the tithes as the townsmen assured me are worth above pounds per annum including small tithes note this parish has two or three chapels of ease viz one at ilford and one on the side of hainault forest called new chapel sir thomas fanshaw of an ancient roman catholic family has a very good estate in this parish a little beyond the town on the road to dagenham stood a great house ancient and now almost fallen down where tradition says the gunpowder treason plot was at first contrived and that all the first consultations about it were held there this side of the county is rather rich in land than in inhabitants occasioned chiefly by the unhealthiness of the air for these low marsh grounds which with all the south side of the county have been saved out of the river thames and out of the sea where the river is wide enough to be called so begin here or rather begin at west ham by stratford and continue to extend themselves from hence eastward growing wider and wider till we come beyond tilbury when the flat country lies six seven or eight miles broad and is justly said to be both unhealthy and unpleasant however the lands are rich and as is observable it is very good farming in the marshes because the landlords let good pennyworths for it being a place where everybody cannot live those that venture it will have encouragement and indeed it is but reasonable they should several little observations i made in this part of the county of essex we saw passing from barking to dagenham the famous breach made by an inundation of the thames which was so great as that it laid near acres of land under water but which after near ten years lying under water and being several times blown up has been at last effectually stopped by the application of captain perry the gentleman who for several years had been employed in the czar of muscovy s works at veronitza on the river don this breach appeared now effectually made up and they assured us that the new work where the breach was is by much esteemed the strongest of all the sea walls in that level it was observable that great part of the lands in these levels especially those on this side east tilbury are held by the farmers cow keepers and grazing butchers who live in and near london and that they are generally stocked all the winter half year with large fat sheep viz lincolnshire and leicestershire wethers which they buy in smithfield in september and october when the lincolnshire and leicestershire graziers sell off their stock and are kept here till christmas or candlemas or thereabouts and though they are not made at all fatter here than they were when bought in yet the farmer or butcher finds very good advantage in it by the difference of the price of mutton between michaelmas when it is cheapest and candlemas when it is dearest this is what the butchers value themselves upon when they tell us at the market that it is right marsh mutton in the bottom of these marshes and close to the edge of the river stands the strong fortress of tilbury called tilbury fort which may justly be looked upon as the key of the river thames and consequently the key of the city of london it is a regular fortification the design of it was a pentagon but the water bastion as it would have been called was never built the plan was laid out by sir martin beckman chief engineer to

and according to luttrell s brief historical relation i in many places was not very pleasing but afforded matter of sport to some persons among several replies was one entitled a letter from a person of quality to his friend clearly there was need to answer this pamphlet and to state more fully the case against the whigs this task was undertaken by two of the greatest writers of english prose george savile then earl later marquis of halifax and john dryden halifax in the tract lately identified as his by hugh macdonald cambridge observations upon a late libel though he might scarify an individual opponent like shaftesbury or pour ridicule upon a sentence from a letter set himself the task of answering the whig case as a whole the text he dilated upon was there seemeth to be no other rule allowed by one sort of men than that they cannot err and the king cannot be in the right with superb irony and wit he demonstrated how inconsistent such an attitude was with the constitution of that day dryden s tract his majesties declaration defended is like the one he is answering in the form of a letter to a friend who has asked the writer s opinion of the declaration and the answer to it i shall obey you the more willingly dryden responds because i know you are a lover of the peace and quietness of your country which the author of this seditious pamphlet is endeavouring to disturb he writes to show the goodness and equity of the prince because once they are understood the faction will lose its power and the well meaning but misled crowd will be no longer deceived by the specious names of religion and liberty after these introductory paragraphs dryden began to reply to the pamphlet point by point his method is to quote or more strictly partly to quote and partly to paraphrase a sentence and then refute its argument in so doing he is following the method of the author of a letter accordingly to understand and judge the fairness of dryden s refutation it is well first to read his majesties declaration then a letter and finally dryden the first has not been reprinted in full but a substantial extract may be found in echard s history of england iii and in arthur bryant s the letters of charles ii pp the second is available in a not uncommon folio state tracts being a collection of several treatises privately printed in the reign of k charles ii and the third is here reproduced for the first time after the perusal of these three tracts the student may well turn to absalom and achitophel and find instruction in comparing the prose and the verse he may reach the conclusion that while both were written to win converts to the royal cause the first was designed to weaken the whig party and the second to take advantage of a tide that had turned to ruin the whig leaders for a fuller discussion of the relationship of dryden s tract and his poem see the writer s article the conclusion of dryden s absalom and achitophel in the huntington library

touching the reasons which moved him to dissolve the two last parliaments at westminster and oxford london printed for t davies the kings declaration defended sir since you are pleas d to require my opinion of the kings declaration and the answer to it which you write me word was sent you lately i shall obey you the more willingly because i know you are a lover of the peace and quietness of your country which the author of this seditious pamphlet is endeavouring to disturb be pleas d to understand then that before the declaration was yet published and while it was only the common news that such an one there was intended to justifie the dissolution of the two last parliaments it was generally agreed by the heads of the discontented party that this declaration must be answer d and that with all the ingredients of malice which the ablest amongst them could squeeze into it accordingly upon the first appearance of it in print five several pens of their cabal were set to work and the product of each having been examin d a certain person of quality appears to have carried the majority of votes and to be chosen like a new matthias to succeed in the place of their deceas d judas he seems to be a man cut out to carry on vigorously the designs of the phanatique party which are manifestly in this paper to hinder the king from making any good impression on his subjects by giving them all possible satisfaction and the reason of this undertaking is manifest for if once the goodness and equity of the prince comes to be truly understood by the people the authority of the faction is extinguish d and the well meaning crowd who are misled will no longer gape after the specious names of religion and liberty much like the folly of the jews expecting a messiah still to come whose

engage in religious controversy and the furious contest civil and ecclesiastical which ensued on the accession of queen anne gave him an opportunity of gratifying his favourite passion he therefore published a tract entitled the shortest way with the dissenters or proposals for the establishment of the church which contained an ironical recommendation of persecution but written in so serious a strain that many persons particularly dissenters at first mistook its real intention the high church party however saw and felt the ridicule and by their influence a prosecution was commenced against him and a proclamation published in the gazette offering a reward for his apprehension when de foe found with how much rigour himself and his pamphlet were about to be treated he at first secreted himself but his printer and bookseller being taken into custody he surrendered being resolved as he expresses it to throw himself upon the favour of government rather than that others should be ruined for his mistakes in july he was brought to trial found guilty and sentenced to be imprisoned to stand in the pillory and to pay a fine of two hundred marks he underwent the infamous part of the punishment with great fortitude and it seems to have been generally thought that he was treated with unreasonable severity so far was he from being ashamed of his fate himself that he wrote a hymn to

newgate his family ruined and himself without hopes of deliverance till sir robert harley who approved of his principles and foresaw that during a factious age such a genius could be converted to many uses represented his unmerited sufferings to the queen and at length procured his release the treasurer lord godolphin also sent a considerable sum to his wife and family and to him money to pay his fine and the expense of his discharge gratitude and fidelity are inseparable from an honest man and it was this benevolent act that prompted de foe to support harley with his able and ingenious pen when anne lay lifeless and his benefactor in the vicissitude of party was persecuted by faction and overpowered though not conquered by violence the talents and perseverance of de foe began now to be properly estimated and as a firm supporter of the administration he was sent by lord godolphin to scotland on an errand which as he says was far from being unfit for a sovereign to direct or an honest man to perform his knowledge of commerce and revenue his powers of insinuation and above all his readiness of pen were deemed of no small utility in promoting the union of the two kingdoms of which he wrote an able history in with two dedications one to the queen and another to the duke of queensbury soon afterwards he unhappily by some equivocal writings rendered himself suspected by both parties so that he once more retired to newington in hopes of spending the remainder of his days in peace his pension being withdrawn and wearied with politics he began to compose works of a different kind the year may therefore be regarded as the period of de foe s political life faction henceforth found other advocates and parties procured other writers to disseminate their suggestions and to propagate their falsehoods in de foe published the family instructor a work inculcating the domestic duties in a lively manner by narration and dialogue and displaying much knowledge of life in the middle ranks of society religious courtship also appeared soon after which like the family instructor is eminently religious and moral in its tendency and strongly impresses on the mind that spirit of

some of the true meaning of the way of god in the whirle wind and in the storm the design of this discourse therefore is to put the nation in general upon proper resolutions if we pretend to believe that there is any such thing as a collateral sympathy a communication of circumstances between a nations follies and her fate any harmony between merit and mischief between the crimes of men and the vengeance of heaven we cannot but allow this extra pulpit admonition to be just and let not any man object against this being call d a sermon and its being introduc d from a text of scripture while the remainer of this discourse seems wholly civil and political if all our measures in civil affairs were deduc d as inferences from sacred texts i am of the opinion the text would be well improv d and publick matters never the worse guided and for this reason tho the subject be not treated with the gravity of a sermon nor in so serious a manner as would become a pulpit yet it may be not the less suitable to the occasion and for the manner it must be placed to the authors account besides the title i think has provided for the method and if so he that expected it otherwise than it is tis his fault and not mine the term sermon which is but sermo a speech may justify all the novelty of my method if those who find fault please to give themselves leave to allow it and since it has never profain d the pulpit i believe the text will receive no prejudice by it i wish every sermon equally improv d and what tho your humble servant be no man of the text if he be a man of honesty he may have a hand in making you all men of application in publick callamities every circumstance is a sermon and every thing we see a preacher the trembling habitations of an unthinking people preach to us and might have made any nation in the world tremble but us when we were rock d out of our sleep as children are rock d into it and when the terrible hand of soveraign power rock d many a wretch from one sleep to another and made a grave of the bed without the ceremony of waking in the passage the shatter d palaces of our princes preach to us and tell us aloud that without respect to dignity he is able to put that dreadful text in execution that if a nation does wickedly they shall be destroy d both they and their king the fallen oaks which stood before to tell us they were the longest liv d of all god s creatures preach to us and tell us that the most towring object of humane beauty and strength must lye humble and prostrate when he is pleased to give a check to that splendor which was deriv d from his power the wrecks of our navies and fleets preach to us that tis in vain we pretend to be wall d about by the ocean and ride masters of the sea and that if he who bestow d that scituation upon us thinks fit he can make that element which has been our strength and the encreaser of our wealth be the grave of our treasure and the enemy of our commerce he can put it into so violent agitation by the blast of his mouth that all our defence and the naval strength we have vallued our selves so much upon shall at once be swallow d up in the mouth of our friend the sea and we shall find our destruction in the very thing from which we expected our defence our seamen and soldiers whose dead bodies embrace the english shores preach aloud to us that whenever we think fit to embark them on any design which heaven approves not of he can blast the embrio and devour those people whose hands are lifted up against justice and right also they preach to us not to build our hopes of success upon the multitude of ships or men who are thus easily reduc d and the strength of a whole nation brought to ruine in a moment these are the monitors of our missfortunes and some of these admonitions would be well preach d from the mouths of those whose tallent as well as office gives them reason to do it and us to expect it but since the sons of the prophets have not yet thought it proper to enter very far into this matter not doubting but they will in due time find it as suitable to their inclination as tis to their duty in the mean time let us see if no uncommon application may be made of so uncommon a circumstance first tis matter of wonder that any man can be so senceless as to suppose there is nothing extraordinary in so signal an instance of a supream power but tis much more remarkable that those who have religion enough to own it a judgment are yet at a loss how to appropriate it s signification every one thinks it to be a judgment upon the person or parties

last bill was really frightful being a higher number than had been known to have been buried in one week since the preceding visitation of however all this went off again and the weather proving cold and the frost which began in december still continuing very severe even till near the end of february attended with sharp though moderate winds the bills decreased again and the city grew healthy and everybody began to look upon the danger as good as over only that still the burials in st giles s continued high from the beginning of april especially they stood at twenty five each week till the week from the th to the th when there was buried in st giles s parish thirty whereof two of the plague and eight of the spotted fever which was looked upon as the same thing likewise the number that died of the spotted fever in the whole increased being eight the week before and twelve the week above named this alarmed us all again and terrible apprehensions were among the people especially the weather being now changed and growing warm and the summer being at hand however the next week there seemed to be some hopes again the bills were low the number of the dead in all was but there was none of the plague and but four of the spotted fever but the following week it returned again and the distemper was spread into two or three other parishes viz st andrew s holborn st clement danes and to the great affliction of the city one died within the walls in the parish of st mary woolchurch that is to say in bearbinder lane near stocks market in all there were nine of the plague and six of the spotted fever it was however upon inquiry found that this frenchman who died in bearbinder lane was one who having lived in long acre near the infected houses had removed for fear of the distemper not knowing that he was already infected this was the beginning of may yet the weather was temperate variable and cool enough and people had still some hopes that which encouraged them was that the city was healthy the whole ninety seven parishes buried but fifty four and we began to hope that as it was chiefly among the people at that end of the town it might go no farther and the rather because the next week which was from the th of may to the th there died but three of which not one within the whole city or liberties and st andrew s buried but fifteen which was very low tis true st

and that many died of it every day so that now all our extenuations abated and it was no more to be concealed nay it quickly appeared that the infection had spread itself beyond all hopes of abatement that in the parish of st giles it was gotten into several streets and several families lay all sick together and accordingly in the weekly bill for the next week the thing began to show itself there was indeed but fourteen set down of the plague but this was all knavery and collusion for in st giles s parish they buried forty in all whereof it was certain most of them died of the plague though they were set down of other distempers and though the number of all the burials were not increased above thirty two and the whole bill being but yet there was fourteen of the spotted fever as well as fourteen of the plague and we took it for granted upon the whole that there were fifty died that week of the plague the next bill was from the rd of may to the th when the number of the plague was seventeen but the burials in st giles s were fifty three a frightful number of whom they set down but nine of the plague but on an examination more strictly by the justices of peace and at the lord mayor s request it was found there were twenty more who were really dead of the plague in that parish but had been set down of the spotted fever or other distempers besides others concealed but those were trifling things to what followed immediately after for now the weather set in hot and from the first week in june the infection spread in a dreadful manner and the bills rose high the articles of

of quality to his friend clearly there was need to answer this pamphlet and to state more fully the case against the whigs this task was undertaken by two of the greatest writers of english prose george savile then earl later marquis of halifax and john dryden halifax in the tract lately identified as his by hugh macdonald cambridge observations upon a late libel though he might scarify an individual opponent like shaftesbury or pour ridicule upon a sentence from a letter set himself the task of answering the whig case as a whole the text he dilated upon was there seemeth to be no other rule allowed by one sort of men than that they cannot err and the king cannot be in the right with superb irony and wit he demonstrated how inconsistent such an attitude was with the constitution of that day dryden s tract his majesties declaration defended is like the one he is answering in the form of a letter to a friend who has asked the writer s opinion of the declaration and the answer to it i shall obey you the more willingly dryden responds because i know you are a lover of the peace and quietness of your country which the author of this seditious pamphlet is endeavouring to disturb he writes to show the goodness and equity of the prince because once they are understood the faction will lose its power and the well meaning but misled crowd will be no longer deceived by the specious names of religion and liberty after these introductory paragraphs dryden began to reply to the pamphlet point by point his method is to quote or more strictly partly to quote and partly to paraphrase a sentence and then refute its argument in so doing he is following the method of the author of a letter accordingly to understand and judge the fairness of dryden s refutation it is well first to read his majesties declaration then a letter and finally dryden the first has not been reprinted in full but a substantial extract may be found in echard s history of england iii and in arthur bryant s the letters of charles ii pp the second is available in a not uncommon folio state tracts being a collection of several treatises privately printed in the reign of k charles ii and the third is here reproduced for the first time after the perusal of these three tracts the student may well turn to absalom and achitophel and find instruction in comparing the prose and the verse he may reach the conclusion that while both were written to win converts to the royal cause the first was designed to weaken the whig party and the second to take advantage of a tide that had turned to ruin the whig leaders for a fuller discussion of the relationship of dryden s tract and his poem see the writer s article the conclusion of dryden s absalom and achitophel in the huntington library

opinion of the kings declaration and the answer to it which you write me word was sent you lately i shall obey you the more willingly because i know you are a lover of the peace and quietness of your country which the author of this seditious pamphlet is endeavouring to disturb be pleas d to understand then that before the declaration was yet published and while it was only the common news that such an one there was intended to justifie the dissolution of the two last parliaments it was generally agreed by the heads of the discontented party that this declaration must be answer d and that with all the ingredients of malice which the ablest amongst them could squeeze into it accordingly upon the first appearance of it in print five several pens of their cabal were set to work and the product of each having been examin d a certain person of quality appears to have carried the majority of votes and to be chosen like a new matthias to succeed in the place of their deceas d judas he seems to be a man cut out to carry on vigorously the designs of the phanatique party which are manifestly in this paper to hinder the king from making any good impression on his subjects by giving them all possible satisfaction and the reason of this undertaking is manifest for if once the goodness and equity of the prince comes to be truly understood by the people the authority of the faction

mine eyes here therefore courteous reader i present thee with the life and death of mr badman indeed yea i do trace him in his life from his childhood to his death that thou mayest as in a glass behold with thine own eyes the steps that take hold of hell and also discern while thou art reading of mr badmans death whether thou thy self art treading in his path thereto and let me entreat thee to forbear quirking and mocking for that i say mr badman is dead but rather gravely enquire concerning thy self by the word whether thou art one of his linage or no for mr badman has left many of his relations behind him yea the very world is overspread with his kindred true some of his relations as he are gone to their place and long home but thousands of thousands are left behind as brothers sisters cousens nephews besides innumerable of his friends and associates i may say and yet speak nothing but too much truth in so saying that there is scarce a fellowship a community or fraternity of men in the world but some of mr badmans relations are there yea rarely can we find a family or houshold in a town where he has not left behind him either brother nephew or friend the butt therefore that at this time i shoot at is wide and twill be as impossible for this book to go into several families and not to arrest some as for the kings messenger to rush into an house full of traitors and find none but honest men there i cannot but think that this shot will light upon many since our fields are so full of this game but how many it will kill to mr badmans course and make alive to the pilgrims progress that is not in me to determine this secret is with the lord our god only and he alone knows to whom he will bless it to so good and so blessed an end however i have put fire to the pan and doubt not but the report will quickly be heard i told you before that mr badman had left many of his friends and relations behind him but if i survive them as that s a great question to me i may also write of their lives however whether my life be longer or shorter this is my prayer at present that god will stir up witnesses against them that may either convert or confound them for wherever they live and roll in their wickedness they are the pest and plague of that countrey england shakes and totters already by reason of the burden that mr badman and his friends have wickedly laid upon it yea our earth reels and staggereth to and fro like a drunkard the transgression thereof is heavy upon it courteous reader i will treat thee now even at the door and threshold of this house but only with this intelligence that mr badman lies dead within be pleased therefore if thy leisure will serve thee to enter in and behold the state in which he is laid betwixt his death bed and the grave he is not buried as yet nor doth he stink as is designed he shall before he lies down in oblivion now as others have had their funerals solemnized according to their greatness and grandure in the world so likewise mr badman forasmuch as he deserveth not to go down to his grave with silence has his funeral state according to his deserts four things are usual at great mens funerals which we will take leave and i hope without offence to allude to in the funeral of mr badman first they are sometimes when dead presented to their friends by their compleatly wrought images as lively as by cunning mens hands they can be that the remembrance of them may be renewed to their survivors the remembrance of them and their deeds and this i have endeavoured to answer in my discourse of mr badman and therefore i have drawn him forth in his featours and actions from his childhood to his gray hairs here therefore thou hast him lively set forth as in cutts both as to the minority flower and seniority of his age together with those actions of his life that he was most capable of doing in and under those present circumstances of time place strength and the opportunities that did attend him in these secondly there is also usual at great mens funerals those badges and scutcheons of their honour that they have received from their ancestors or have been thought worthy of for the deeds and exploits they have done in their life and here mr badman has his but such as vary from all men of worth but so much the more agreeing with the merit of his doings they all have descended in state he only as an abominable branch his deserts are the deserts of sin and therefore the scutcheons of honour that he has are only that he died without honour and at his end became a fool thou shalt not be joyned with them in burial the seed of evil doers shall never be renowned the funeral pomp therefore of mr badman is to wear upon his hearse the badges of a dishonourable and wicked life since his bones are full of the sins of his youth which shall lye down as job sayes in the dust with him nor is it fit that any should be his attendants now at his death but such as with him conspired against their own souls in their life persons whose transgressions have made them infamous to all that have or shall know what they have done some notice therefore i have also here in this little discourse given the reader of them who were his confederates in his life and attendants at his death with a hint either of some high villany committed by them as also of those judgments that have overtaken and fallen upon them from the just and revenging hand of god all which are things either fully known by me as being eye and ear witness thereto or that i have received from such hands whose relation as to this i am bound to believe and that the reader may know them from other things and passages herein contained i have pointed at them in the margent

thus one mr owen parry a welsh gentleman of good repute coming from bristol to padstow a little seaport in the county of cornwall near the place where dickory dwelt and hearing much of this dumb man s perfections would needs have him sent for and finding by his significant gestures and all outward appearances that he much exceeded the character that the country gave of him took a mighty liking to him insomuch that he told him if he would go with him into pembrokeshire he would be kind to him and take care of him as long as he lived this kind and unexpected offer was so welcome to poor dickory that without any farther consideration he got a pen and ink and writ a note and in a very handsome and submissive manner returned him thanks for his favour assuring him he would do his best to continue and improve it and that he would be ready to wait upon him whenever he should be pleased to command to shorten the account as much as possible all things were concluded to their mutual satisfaction and in about a fortnight s time they set forward for wales where dickory notwithstanding his dumbness behaved himself with so much diligence and affability that he not only gained the love of the family where he lived but of everybody round him in this station he continued till the death of his master which happened about twenty years afterwards in all which time as has been confirmed by several of the family he was never observed to be any ways disguised by drinking or to be guilty of any of the follies and irregularities incident to servants in gentlemen s houses on the contrary when he had any spare time his constant custom was to retire with some good book into a private place within call and there employ himself in reading and then writing down his observations upon what he read after the death of his master whose loss afflicted him to the last degree one mrs mary mordant a gentlewoman of great virtue and piety and a very good fortune took him into her service and carried him with her first to bath and then to bristol where after a lingering distemper which continued for about four years she died likewise upon the loss of his mistress dickory grew again exceeding melancholy and disconsolate at length reflecting that death is but a common debt which all mortals owe to nature and must be paid sooner or later he became a little better satisfied and so determines to get together what he had saved in his service and then to return to his native country and there finish his life in privacy and retirement having been as has been mentioned about twenty four years a servant and having in the interim received two legacies viz one of thirty pounds left him by his master and another of fifteen pounds by his mistress and being always very frugal he had got by him in the whole upwards of sixty pounds this thinks he with prudent management will be enough to support me as long as i live and so i ll e en lay aside all thoughts of future business and make the best of my way to cornwall and there find out some safe and solitary retreat where i may have liberty to meditate and make my melancholy observations upon the several occurrences of human life this resolution prevailed so far that no time was let slip to get everything in readiness to go with the first ship as to his money he always kept that locked up by him unless he sometimes lent it to a friend without interest for he had a mortal hatred to all sorts of usury or extortion his books of which he had a considerable quantity and some of them very good ones together with his other equipage he got packed up that nothing might be wanting against the first opportunity in a few days he heard of a vessel bound to padstow the very port he wished to go to being within four or five miles of the place where he was born when he came thither which was in less than a week his first business was to inquire after the state of his family it was some time before he could get any information of them until an old man that knew his father and mother and remembered they had a son was born dumb recollected him and after a great deal of difficulty made him understand that all his family except his youngest sister were dead and that she was a widow and lived at a little town called st helen s about ten miles farther in the country this doleful news we must imagine must be extremely shocking and add a new sting to his former affliction and here it was that he began to exercise the philosopher and to demonstrate himself both a wise and a good man all these things thinks he are the will of providence and must not be disputed and so he bore up under them with an entire resignation resolving that as soon as he could find a place where he might deposit his trunk and boxes with safety he would go to st helen s in quest of his sister how his sister and he met and how transported they were to see each other after so long an interval i think is not very material it is enough for the present purpose that dickory soon recollected his sister and she him and after a great many endearing tokens of love and tenderness he wrote to her telling her that he believed providence had bestowed on him as much as would support him as long as he lived and that if she thought proper he would come and spend the remainder of his days with her the good woman no sooner read his proposal than she accepted it adding withal that she could wish her entertainment was better but if he would accept of it as it was she would do her best to make everything easy and that he should be welcome upon his own terms to stay with her as long as he pleased this affair being so happily settled to his full satisfaction he returns to padstow to fetch the things he had left behind him and

these weeks although it was at a time of the year when usually the bills are very moderate the usual number of burials within the bills of mortality for a week was from about or thereabouts to the

last bill was really frightful being a higher number than had been known to have been buried in one week since the preceding visitation of however all this went off again and the weather proving cold and the frost which began in december still continuing very severe even till near the end of february attended with sharp though moderate winds the bills decreased again and the city grew healthy and everybody began to look upon the danger as good as over only that still the burials in st giles s continued high from the beginning of april especially they stood at twenty five each week till the week from the th to the th when there was buried in st giles s parish thirty whereof two of the plague and eight of the spotted fever which was looked upon as the same thing likewise the number that died of the spotted fever in the whole increased being eight the week before and twelve the week above named this alarmed us all again and terrible apprehensions were among the people especially the weather being now changed and growing warm and the summer being at hand however the next week there seemed to be some hopes again the bills were low the number of the dead in all was but there was none of the plague and but four of the spotted fever but the following week it returned again and the distemper was spread into two or three other parishes viz st andrew s holborn st clement danes and to the great affliction of the city one died within the walls in the parish of st mary woolchurch that is to say in bearbinder lane near stocks market in all there were nine of the plague and six of the spotted fever it was however upon inquiry found that this frenchman who died in bearbinder lane was one who having lived in long acre near the infected houses had removed for fear of the distemper not knowing that he was already infected this was the beginning of may yet the weather was temperate variable and cool enough and people had still some hopes that which encouraged them was that the city was healthy the whole ninety seven parishes buried but fifty four and we began to hope that as it was chiefly among the people at that end of the town it might go no farther and the rather because the next week which was from the th of may to the th there died but three of which not one within the whole city or liberties and st andrew s buried but fifteen which was very low tis true st giles s buried two and thirty but still as there was but one of the plague people began to be easy the whole bill also was very low for the week before the bill was but and the week above mentioned but we continued in these hopes for a few days but it was but for a few for the people were no more to be deceived thus they searched the houses and found that the plague was really spread every way and that many died of it every day so that now all our extenuations abated and it was no more to be concealed nay it quickly appeared that the infection had spread itself beyond all hopes of abatement that in the parish of st giles it was gotten into several streets and several families lay all sick together and accordingly in the weekly bill for the next week the thing began to show itself there was indeed but fourteen set down of the plague but this was all knavery and collusion for in st giles s parish they buried forty in all whereof it was certain most of them died of the plague though they were set down of other distempers and though the number of all the burials were not increased above thirty two and the whole bill being but yet there was fourteen of the spotted fever as well as fourteen of the plague and we took it for granted upon the whole that there were fifty died that week of the plague the next bill was from the rd of may to the th when the number of the plague was seventeen but the burials in st giles s were fifty three a frightful number of whom they set down but nine of the plague but on an examination more strictly by the justices of peace and at the lord mayor s request it was found there were twenty more who were really dead of the plague in that parish but had been set down of the spotted fever or other distempers besides others concealed but those were trifling things to what followed immediately after for now the weather set in hot and from the first week in june the infection spread in a dreadful manner and the bills rose high the articles of the fever spotted fever and teeth began to swell for all that could conceal their distempers did it to prevent their neighbours shunning and refusing to converse with them and also to prevent

lamentable cry saying what shall i do bedford jail in which bunyan was twelve years a prisoner in this plight therefore he went home and restrained himself as long as he could that his wife and children should not perceive his distress but he could not be silent long because that his trouble increased wherefore at length he brake his mind to his wife and children and thus he began to talk to them oh my dear wife said he and you my sweet children i your dear friend am in myself undone by reason of a burden that lieth hard upon me moreover i am told to a certainty that this our city will be burned with fire from heaven in which fearful overthrow both myself with thee my wife and you my sweet babes shall miserably come to ruin except some way of escape can be found whereby we may be delivered at this all his family were sore amazed not for that they believed that what he had said to them was true but because they thought that some frenzy or madness had got into his head therefore it drawing towards night and they hoping that sleep might settle his brain with all haste they got him to bed but the night was as troublesome to him as the day wherefore instead of sleeping he spent it in sighs and tears so when the morning was come they would know how he did he told them worse and worse he also set to talking to them again but they began to be hardened they also thought to drive away his madness by harsh and surly treatment of him sometimes they would ridicule sometimes they would chide and sometimes they would quite neglect him wherefore he began to retire himself to his chamber to pray for and pity them and also to sorrow over his own misery he would also walk solitary in the fields sometimes reading and sometimes praying and thus for some days he spent his time sidenote christian s distress of mind now i saw upon a time when he was walking in the fields that he was as he was wont reading in his book and greatly distressed in his mind and as he read he burst out as he had done before crying what shall i do to be saved i saw also that he looked this way and that way as if he would run yet he stood still because as i perceived he could not tell which way to go i looked then and saw a man named evangelist coming to him who asked wherefore dost thou cry illustration evangelist points to wicket gate page he answered sir i read in the book in my hand that i am condemned to die and after that to come to judgment and i find that i am not willing to do the first nor able to do the second then said evangelist why not willing to die since this life is troubled with so many evils the man answered because i fear that this burden that is upon my back will sink me lower than the grave and i shall fall into tophet and sir if i be not fit to go to prison i am not fit to go to judgment and from thence to death and the thoughts of these things make me cry tophet here means hell then said evangelist if this be thy condition why standest thou still he answered because i know not whither to go then he gave him a parchment roll and there was written within flee from the wrath to come the man therefore read it and looking upon evangelist very carefully said whither must i fly then said evangelist pointing with his finger over a very wide field do you see yonder wicket gate the man said no then said the other do you see yonder shining light he said i think i do then said evangelist keep that light in your eye and go up directly thereto so shalt thou see the gate at which when thou knockest it shall be told thee what thou shalt do so i saw in my dream that the man began to run now he had not run far from his own door when his wife and children perceiving it began to cry after him to return but the man put his fingers in his ears and ran on crying life life eternal life so he looked not behind him but fled towards the middle of the plain sidenote christian flees from the city the neighbors also came out to see him run and as he ran some mocked others threatened and some cried after him to return and among those that did so there were two that resolved to fetch him back by force the name of the one was obstinate and the name of the other pliable now by this time the man was got a good distance from them but however they were resolved to pursue him which they did and in a little time they overtook him then said the man neighbors wherefore are ye come they said to persuade you to go back with us but he said that can by no means be you dwell said he in the city of destruction the place also where i was born i see it to be so and dying there sooner or later you will sink lower than the grave into a place that burns with fire and brimstone be content good neighbors and go along with me obst what said obstinate and leave our friends and comforts behind us chris yes said christian for that was his name because that all which you forsake is not worthy to be compared with a little of that i am seeking to enjoy and if you would go along with me and hold it you shall fare as i myself for there where i go is enough and to spare come away and pr

hand britannic majesty in person shortly after gets across to hanover and friedrich despatches truchsess with bielfeld adjoined to return the courtesy friedrich does not neglect these points of good manners along with which something of substantial may be privately conjoined for example if he had in secret his eye on julich and berg could anything be fitter than to ascertain what the french will think of such an enterprise what the french and next to them what the english that is to say hanoverians who meddle much in affairs of the reich for these reasons and others he likewise probably with

years full of observation experience and sound sense with one arm which he makes do the work of two and nobody can notice that the other arm resting in his coat breast is of cork so expert is he will do in this matter what is feasible probably not much for the present he is to call on voltaire as he passes who is in holland again at the hague for some months back and deliver him a little cask of hungary wine which probably his majesty had thought exquisite of which and the other insignificant passages between them we hear more than enough in the writings and correspondences of voltaire about

mere hope and exuberance as yet and may even be made worse than nothing according to the knights he shall manage to have happily it proved a successful new order in this last all essential particular

thus one mr owen parry a welsh gentleman of good repute coming from bristol to padstow a little seaport in the county of cornwall near the place where dickory dwelt and hearing much of this dumb man s perfections would needs have him sent for and finding by his significant gestures and all outward appearances that he much exceeded the character that the country gave of him took a mighty liking to him insomuch that he told him if he would go with him into pembrokeshire he would be kind to him and take care of him as long as he lived this kind and unexpected offer was so welcome to poor dickory that without any farther consideration he got a pen and ink and writ a note and in a very handsome and submissive manner returned him thanks for his favour assuring him he would do his best to continue and improve it and that he would be ready to wait upon him whenever he should be pleased to command to shorten the account as much as possible all things were concluded to their mutual satisfaction and in about a fortnight s time they set forward for wales where dickory notwithstanding his dumbness behaved himself with so much diligence and affability that he not only gained the love of the family where he lived but of everybody round him in this station he continued till the death of his master which happened about twenty years afterwards in all which time as has been confirmed by several of the family he was never observed to be any ways disguised by drinking or to be guilty of any of the follies and irregularities incident to servants in gentlemen s houses on the contrary when he had any spare time his constant custom was to retire with some good book into a private place within call and there employ himself in reading and then writing down his observations upon what he read after the death of his master whose loss afflicted him to the last degree one mrs mary mordant a gentlewoman of great virtue and piety and a very good fortune took him into her service and carried him with her first to bath and then to bristol where after a lingering distemper which continued for about four years she died likewise upon the loss of his mistress dickory grew again exceeding melancholy and disconsolate at length reflecting that death is but a common debt which all mortals owe to nature and must be paid sooner or later he became a little better satisfied and so determines to get together what he had saved in his service and then to return to his native country and there finish his life in privacy and retirement having been as has been mentioned about twenty four years a servant and having in the interim received two legacies viz one of thirty pounds left him by his master and another of fifteen pounds by his mistress and being always very frugal he had got by him in the whole upwards of sixty pounds this thinks he with prudent management will be enough to support me as long as i live and so i ll e en lay aside all thoughts of future business and make the best of my way to cornwall and there find out some safe and solitary retreat where i may have liberty to meditate and make my melancholy observations upon the several occurrences of human life this resolution prevailed so far that no time was let slip to get everything in readiness to go with the first ship as to his money he always kept that locked up by him unless he sometimes lent it to a friend without interest for he had a mortal hatred to all sorts of usury or extortion his books of which he had a considerable quantity and some of them very good ones together with his other equipage he got packed up that nothing might be wanting against the first opportunity in a few days he heard of a vessel bound to padstow the very port he wished to go to being within four or five miles of the place where he was born when he came thither which was in less than a week his first business was to inquire after the state of his family it was some time before he could get any information of them until an old man that knew his father and mother and remembered they had a son was born dumb recollected him and after a great deal of difficulty made him understand that all his family except his youngest sister were dead and that she was a widow and lived at a little town called st helen s about ten miles farther in the country this doleful news we must imagine must be extremely shocking and add a new sting to his former affliction and here it was that he began to exercise the philosopher and to demonstrate himself both a wise and a good man all these things thinks he are the will of providence and must not be disputed and so he bore up under them with an entire resignation resolving that as soon as he could find a place where he might deposit his trunk and boxes with safety he would go to st helen s in quest of his sister how his sister and he met and how transported they were to see each other after so long an interval i think is not very material it is enough for the present purpose that dickory soon recollected his sister and she him and after a great many endearing tokens of love and tenderness he wrote to her telling her that he believed providence had bestowed on him as much as would support him as long as he lived and that if she thought proper he would come and spend the remainder of his days with her the good woman no sooner read his proposal than she accepted it adding withal that she could wish her entertainment was better but if he would accept of it as it was she would do her best to make everything easy and that he should be welcome upon his own terms to stay with her as long as he pleased this affair being so happily settled to his full satisfaction he returns to padstow to fetch the things he had left behind him and

engage in religious controversy and the furious contest civil and ecclesiastical which ensued on the accession of queen anne gave him an opportunity of gratifying his favourite passion he therefore published a tract entitled the shortest way with the dissenters or proposals for the establishment of the church which contained an ironical recommendation of persecution but written in so serious a strain that many persons particularly dissenters at first mistook its real intention the high church party however saw and felt the ridicule and by their influence a prosecution was commenced against him and a proclamation published in the gazette offering a reward for his apprehension when de foe found with how much rigour himself and his pamphlet were about to be treated he at first secreted himself but his printer and bookseller being taken into custody he surrendered being resolved as he expresses it to throw himself upon the favour of government rather than that others should be ruined for his mistakes in july he was brought to trial found guilty and sentenced to be imprisoned to stand in the pillory and to pay a fine of two hundred marks he underwent the infamous part of the punishment with great fortitude and it seems to have been generally thought that he was treated with unreasonable severity so far was he from being ashamed of his fate himself that he wrote a hymn to

newgate his family ruined and himself without hopes of deliverance till sir robert harley who approved of his principles and foresaw that during a factious age such a genius could be converted to many uses represented his unmerited sufferings to the queen and at length procured his release the treasurer lord godolphin also sent a considerable sum to his wife and family and to him money to pay his fine and the expense of his discharge gratitude and fidelity are inseparable from an honest man and it was this benevolent act that prompted de foe to support harley with his able and ingenious pen when anne lay lifeless and his benefactor in the vicissitude of party was persecuted by faction and overpowered though not conquered by violence the talents and perseverance of de foe began now to be properly estimated and as a firm supporter of the administration he was sent by lord godolphin to scotland on an errand which as he says was far from being unfit for a sovereign to direct or an honest man to perform his knowledge of commerce and revenue his powers of insinuation and above all his readiness of pen were deemed of no small utility in promoting the union of the two kingdoms of which he wrote an able history in with two dedications one to the queen and another to the duke of queensbury soon afterwards he unhappily by some equivocal writings rendered himself suspected by both parties so that he once more retired to newington in hopes of spending the remainder of his days in peace his pension being withdrawn and wearied with politics he began to compose works of a different kind the year may therefore be regarded as the period of de foe s political life faction henceforth found other advocates and parties procured other writers to disseminate their suggestions and to propagate their falsehoods in de foe published the family instructor a work inculcating the domestic duties in a lively manner by narration and dialogue and displaying much knowledge of life in the middle ranks of society religious courtship also appeared soon after which like the family instructor is eminently religious and moral in its tendency and strongly impresses on the mind that spirit of

should be obliged to blame the favourites of the people he will be considered as the tool of power if he censures those in power he will be looked on as an instrument of faction but in all exertions of duty something is to be hazarded in cases of tumult and disorder our law has invested every man in some sort with the authority of a magistrate when the affairs of the nation are distracted private people are by the spirit of that law justified in stepping a little out of their ordinary sphere they enjoy a privilege of somewhat more dignity and effect than that of idle lamentation over the calamities of their country they may look into them narrowly they may reason upon them liberally and if they should be so fortunate as to discover the true source of the mischief and to suggest any probable method of removing it though they may displease the rulers for the day they are certainly of service to the cause of government government is deeply interested in everything which even through the medium of some temporary uneasiness may tend finally to compose the minds of the subjects and to conciliate their affections i have nothing to do here with the abstract value of the voice of the people but as long as reputation the most precious possession of every individual and as long as opinion the great support of the state depend entirely upon that voice it can never be considered as a thing of little consequence either to individuals or to government nations are not primarily ruled by laws less by violence whatever original energy may be supposed either in force or regulation the operation of both is in truth merely instrumental nations are governed by the same methods and on the same principles by which an individual without authority is often able to govern those who are his equals or his superiors by a knowledge of their temper and by a judicious management of it i mean when public affairs are steadily and quietly conducted not when government is nothing but a continued scuffle between the magistrate and the multitude in which sometimes the one and sometimes the other is uppermost in which they alternately yield and prevail in a series of contemptible victories and scandalous submissions the temper of the people amongst whom he presides ought therefore to be the first study of a statesman and the knowledge of this temper it is by no means impossible for him to attain if he has not an interest in being ignorant of what it is his duty to learn to complain of the age we live in to murmur at the present possessors of power to lament the past to conceive extravagant hopes of the future are the common dispositions of the greater part of mankind indeed the necessary effects of the ignorance and levity of the vulgar such complaints and humours have existed in all times yet as all times have not been alike true political sagacity manifests itself in distinguishing that complaint which only characterises the general infirmity of human nature from those which are symptoms of the particular distemperature of our own air and season nobody i believe will consider it merely as the language of spleen or disappointment if i say that there is something particularly alarming in the present conjuncture there is hardly a man in or out of power who holds any other language that government is at once dreaded and contemned that the laws are despoiled of all their respected and salutary terrors that their inaction is a subject of ridicule and their exertion of abhorrence that rank and office and title and all the solemn plausibilities of the world have lost their reverence and effect that our foreign politics are as much deranged as our domestic economy that our dependencies are slackened in their affection and loosened from their obedience that we know neither how to yield nor how to enforce that hardly anything above or below abroad or at home is sound and entire but that disconnection and confusion in offices in parties in families in parliament in the nation prevail beyond the disorders of any former time these are facts universally admitted and lamented this state of things is the more extraordinary because the great parties which formerly divided and agitated the kingdom are known to be in a manner entirely dissolved no great external calamity has visited the nation no pestilence or famine we do not labour at present under any scheme of taxation new or oppressive in the quantity or in the mode nor are we engaged in unsuccessful war in which our misfortunes might easily pervert our judgment and our minds sore from the loss of national glory might feel every blow of fortune as a crime in government it is impossible that the cause of this strange distemper should not sometimes become a subject of discourse it is a compliment due and which i willingly pay to those who administer our affairs to take notice in the first place of their speculation our ministers are of opinion that the increase of our trade and manufactures that our growth by colonisation and by conquest have concurred to accumulate immense wealth in the hands of some individuals and this again being dispersed amongst the people has rendered them universally proud ferocious and ungovernable that the insolence of some from their enormous wealth and the boldness of others from a guilty poverty have rendered them capable of the most atrocious attempts so that they have trampled upon all subordination and violently borne down the unarmed laws of a free government barriers too feeble against the fury of a populace so fierce and licentious as ours they contend that no adequate provocation has been given for so spreading a discontent our affairs having been conducted throughout with remarkable temper and consummate

these weeks although it was at a time of the year when usually the bills are very moderate the usual number of burials within the bills of mortality for a week was from about or thereabouts to the last was esteemed a pretty high bill but after this we found the bills successively increasing as follows buried increased december the th to the th th rd january january the rd th th th th th this last bill was really frightful being a higher number than had been known to have been buried in one week since the preceding visitation of however all this went off again and the weather proving cold and the frost which began in december still continuing very severe even till near the end of february attended with sharp though moderate winds the bills decreased again and the city grew healthy and everybody began to look upon the danger as good as over only that still the burials in st giles s continued high from the beginning of april especially they stood at twenty five each week till the week from the th to the th when there was buried in st giles s parish thirty whereof two of the plague and eight of the spotted fever which was looked upon as the same thing likewise the number that died of the spotted fever in the whole increased being eight the week before and twelve the week above named this alarmed us all again and terrible apprehensions were among the people especially the weather being now changed and growing warm and the summer being at hand however the next week there seemed to be some hopes again the bills were low the number of the dead in all was but there was none of the plague and but four of the spotted fever but the following week it returned again and the distemper was spread into two or three other parishes viz st andrew s holborn st clement danes and to the great affliction of the city one died within the walls in the parish of st mary woolchurch that is to say in bearbinder lane near stocks market in all there were nine of the plague and six of the spotted fever it was however upon inquiry found that this frenchman who died in bearbinder lane was one who having lived in long acre near the infected houses had removed for fear of the distemper not knowing that he was already infected this was the beginning of may yet the weather was temperate variable and cool enough and people had still some hopes that which encouraged them was that the city was healthy the whole ninety seven parishes buried but fifty four and we began to hope that as it was chiefly among the people at that end of the town it might go no farther and the rather because the next week which was from the th of may to the th there died but three of which not one within the whole city or liberties and st andrew s buried but fifteen which was very low tis true st giles s buried two and thirty but still as there was but one of the plague people began to be easy the whole bill also was very low for the week before the bill was but and the week above mentioned but we continued in these hopes for a few days but it was but for a few for the people were no more to be deceived thus they searched the houses and found that the plague was really spread every way and that many died of it every day so that now all our extenuations abated and it was no more to be concealed nay it quickly appeared that the infection had spread itself beyond all hopes of abatement that in the parish of st giles it was gotten into several streets and several families lay all sick together and accordingly in the weekly bill for the next week the thing began to show itself there was indeed but fourteen set down of the plague but this was all knavery and collusion for in st giles s parish they buried forty in all whereof it was certain most of them died of the plague though they were set down of other distempers and though the number of all the burials were not increased above thirty two and the whole bill being but yet there was fourteen of the spotted fever as well as fourteen of the plague and we took it for granted upon the whole that there were fifty died that week of the plague the next bill was from the rd of may to the th when the number of the plague was seventeen but the burials in st giles s were fifty three a frightful number of whom they set down but nine of the plague but on an examination more strictly by the justices of peace and at the lord mayor s request it was found there were twenty more who were really dead of the plague in that parish but had been set down of the spotted fever or other distempers besides others concealed but those were trifling things to what followed immediately after for now the weather set in hot and from the first week in june the infection spread in a dreadful manner and the bills rose high the articles of the fever spotted fever and teeth began to swell for all that could conceal their distempers did it to prevent their neighbours shunning and refusing to converse with them and also to prevent authority shutting up their houses which though it was not yet practised yet was threatened and people were extremely terrified at the thoughts of it the second week in june the parish of st giles

separated at the outset i never saw him when we forded the river when we planted the english flag in the first breach when we crossed the ditch beyond and fighting every inch of our way entered the town it was only at dusk when the place was ours and after general baird himself had found the dead body of tippoo under a heap of the slain that herncastle and i met we were each attached to a party sent out by the general s orders to prevent the plunder and confusion which followed our conquest the camp followers committed deplorable excesses and worse still the soldiers found their way by a guarded door into the treasury of the palace and loaded themselves with gold and jewels it was in the court outside the treasury that my cousin and i met to enforce the laws of discipline on our own soldiers herncastle s fiery temper had been as i could plainly see exasperated to a kind of frenzy by the terrible slaughter through which we had passed he was very unfit in my opinion to perform the duty that had been entrusted to him there was riot and confusion enough in the treasury but no violence that i saw the men if i may use such an expression disgraced themselves good humouredly all sorts of rough jests and catchwords were bandied about among them and the story of the diamond turned up again unexpectedly in the form of a mischievous joke who s got the moonstone was the rallying cry which perpetually caused the plundering as soon as it was stopped in one place to break out in another while i was still vainly trying to establish order i heard a frightful yelling on the other side of the courtyard and at once ran towards the cries in dread of finding some new outbreak of the pillage in that direction i got to an open door and saw the bodies of two indians by their dress as i guessed officers of the palace lying across the entrance dead a cry inside hurried me into a room which appeared to serve as an armoury a third indian mortally wounded was sinking at the feet of a man whose back was towards me the man turned at the instant when i came in and i saw john herncastle with a torch in one hand and a dagger dripping with blood in the other a stone set like a pommel in the end of the dagger s handle flashed in the torchlight as he turned on me like a gleam of fire the dying indian sank to his knees pointed to the dagger in herncastle s hand and said in his native language the moonstone will have its vengeance yet on you and yours he spoke those words and fell dead on the floor before i could stir in the matter the men who had followed me across the courtyard crowded in my cousin rushed to meet them like a madman clear the room he shouted to me and set a guard on the door the men fell back as he threw himself on them with his torch and his dagger i put two sentinels of my own company on whom i could rely to keep the door through the remainder of the night i saw no more of my cousin early in the morning the plunder still going on general baird announced publicly by beat of drum that any thief detected in the fact be he whom he might should be hung the provost marshal was in attendance to prove that the general was in earnest and in the throng that followed the proclamation herncastle and i met again he held out his hand as usual and said good morning i waited before i gave him my hand in return tell me first i said how the indian in the armoury met his death and what those last words meant when he pointed to the dagger in your hand the indian met his death as i suppose by a mortal wound said herncastle what his last words meant i know no more than you do i looked at him narrowly his frenzy of the previous day had all calmed down i determined to give him another chance is that all you have to tell me i asked he answered that is all i turned my back on him and we have not spoken since iv i beg it to be understood that what i write here about my cousin unless some necessity should arise for making it public is for the information of the family only herncastle has said nothing that can justify me in speaking to our commanding officer he has been taunted more than once about the diamond by those who recollect his angry outbreak before the assault but as may easily be imagined his own remembrance of the circumstances under which i surprised him in the armoury has been enough to keep him silent it is reported that he means to exchange into another regiment avowedly for the purpose of separating himself from me whether this be true or not i cannot prevail upon myself to become his accuser and i think with good reason if i made the matter public i have no evidence but moral evidence to bring forward i have not only no proof that he killed the two men at the door i cannot even declare that he killed the third man inside for i cannot say that my own eyes saw the deed committed it is true that i heard the dying indian s words but if those words were pronounced to be the ravings of delirium how could i contradict the assertion from my own knowledge let our relatives on either side form their own opinion on what i have written and decide for themselves whether the aversion i now feel towards this man is well or ill founded although i attach no sort of credit to the fantastic indian legend of the gem i must acknowledge before i conclude that i am influenced by a certain superstition of my own in this matter it is my conviction or my delusion no matter which that crime brings its own fatality with it i am not only persuaded of herncastle s guilt i am even fanciful enough to believe that he will live to regret it if he keeps the diamond and that others will live to regret taking it from him if he gives the diamond away

her majesty s justices of peace so as he may be apprehended shall have a reward of l which her majesty has ordered immediately to be paid upon such discovery london gaz no this is one of those instances of injustice and malignity which so frequently occur in the dunciad and which reflect more dishonour on the author than on the parties traduced de foe lay friendless and distressed in newgate his family ruined and himself without hopes of deliverance till sir robert harley who approved of his principles and foresaw that during a factious age such a genius could be converted to many uses represented his unmerited sufferings to the queen and at length procured his release the treasurer lord godolphin also sent a considerable sum to his wife and family and to him money to pay his fine and the expense of his discharge gratitude and fidelity are inseparable from an honest man and it was this benevolent act that prompted de foe to support harley with his able and ingenious pen when anne lay lifeless and his benefactor in the vicissitude of party was persecuted by faction and overpowered though not conquered by violence the talents and perseverance of de foe began now to be properly estimated and as a firm supporter of the administration he was sent by lord godolphin to scotland on an errand which as he says was far from being unfit for a sovereign to direct or an honest man to perform his knowledge of commerce and revenue his powers of insinuation and above all his readiness of pen were deemed of no small utility in promoting the union of the two kingdoms of which he wrote an able history in with two dedications one to the queen and another to the duke of queensbury soon afterwards he unhappily by some equivocal writings rendered himself suspected by both parties so that he once more retired to newington in hopes of spending the remainder of his days in peace his pension being withdrawn and wearied with politics he began to compose works of a different kind the year may therefore be regarded as the period of de foe s political life faction henceforth found other advocates and parties procured other writers to disseminate their suggestions and to propagate their falsehoods in de foe published the family instructor a work inculcating the domestic duties in a lively manner by narration and dialogue and displaying much knowledge of life in the middle ranks of society religious courtship also appeared soon after which like the family instructor is eminently religious and moral in its tendency and strongly impresses on the mind that spirit of sobriety and private devotion for which the dissenters have generally been distinguished the most celebrated of all his works the life and adventures of robinson crusoe appeared in this work has passed through numerous editions and been translated into almost all modern languages the great invention which is displayed in it the variety of incidents and circumstances which it contains related in the most easy and natural manner together with the excellency of the moral and religious reflections render it a performance of very superior and uncommon merit and one of the most interesting works that ever appeared it is strongly recommended by rosseau as a book admirably calculated to pr

mine eyes here therefore courteous reader i present thee with the life and death of mr badman indeed yea i do trace him in his life from his childhood to his death that thou mayest as in a glass behold with thine own eyes the steps that take hold of hell and also discern while thou art reading of mr badmans death whether thou thy self art treading in his path thereto and let me entreat thee to forbear quirking and mocking for that i say mr badman is dead but rather gravely enquire concerning thy self by the word whether thou art one of his linage or no for mr badman has left many of his relations behind him yea the very world is overspread with his kindred true some of his relations as he are gone to their place and long home but thousands of thousands are left behind as brothers sisters cousens nephews besides innumerable of his friends and associates i may say and yet speak nothing but too much truth in so saying that there is scarce a fellowship a community or fraternity of men in the world but some of mr badmans relations are there yea rarely can we find a family or houshold in a town where he has not left behind him either brother nephew or friend the butt therefore that at this time i shoot at is wide and twill be as impossible for this book to go into several families and not to arrest some as for the kings messenger to rush into an house full of traitors and find none but honest men there i cannot but think that this shot will light upon many since our fields are so full of this game but how many it will kill to mr badmans course and make alive to the pilgrims progress that is not in me to determine this secret is with the lord our god only and he alone knows to whom he will bless it to so good and so blessed an end however i have put fire to the pan and doubt not but the report will quickly be heard i told you before that mr badman had left many of his friends and relations behind him but if i survive them as that s a great question to me i may also write of their lives however whether my life be longer or shorter this is my prayer at present that god will stir up witnesses against them that may either convert or confound them for wherever they live and roll in their wickedness they are the pest and plague of that countrey england shakes and totters already by reason of the burden that mr badman and his friends have wickedly laid upon it yea our earth reels and staggereth to and fro like a drunkard the transgression thereof is heavy upon it courteous reader i will treat thee now even at the door and threshold of this house but only with this intelligence that mr badman lies dead within be pleased therefore if thy leisure will serve thee to enter in and behold the state in which he is laid betwixt his death bed and the grave he is not buried as yet nor doth he stink as is designed he shall before he lies down in oblivion now as others have had their funerals solemnized according to their greatness and grandure in the world so likewise mr badman forasmuch as he deserveth not to go down to his grave with silence has his funeral state according to his deserts four things are usual at great mens funerals which we will take leave and i hope without offence to allude to in the funeral of mr badman first they are sometimes when dead presented to their friends by their compleatly wrought images as lively as by cunning mens hands they can be that the remembrance of them may be renewed to their survivors the remembrance of them and their deeds and this i have endeavoured to answer in my discourse of mr badman and therefore i have drawn him forth in his featours and actions from his childhood to his gray hairs here therefore thou hast him lively set forth as in cutts both as to the minority flower and seniority of his age together with those actions of his life that he was most capable of doing in and under those present circumstances of time place strength and the opportunities that did attend him in these secondly there is also usual at great mens funerals those badges and scutcheons of their honour that they have received from their ancestors or have been thought worthy of for the deeds and exploits they have done in their life and here mr badman has his but such as vary from all men of worth but so much the more agreeing with the merit of his doings they all have descended in state he only as an abominable branch his deserts are the deserts of sin and therefore the scutcheons of honour that he has are only that he died without honour and at his end became a fool thou shalt not be joyned with them in burial the seed of evil doers shall never be renowned the funeral pomp therefore of mr badman is to wear upon his hearse the badges of a dishonourable and wicked life since his bones are full of the sins of his youth which shall lye down as job sayes in the dust with him nor is it fit that any should be his attendants now at his death but such as with him conspired against their own souls in their life persons whose transgressions have made them infamous to all that have or shall know what they have done some notice therefore i have also here in this little discourse given the reader of them who were his confederates in his life and attendants at his death with a hint either of some high villany committed by them as also of those judgments that have overtaken and fallen upon them from the just and revenging hand of god all which are things either fully known by me as being eye and ear witness thereto or that i have received from such hands whose relation as to this i am bound to believe and that the reader may know them from other things and passages herein contained i have pointed at them in the margent

'ONMUTUALSUBJECTION{1}--(FirstPrintedin1744)', '""Yea,allofyoubesubjectonetoanother.""--IPeterv.5', 'TheAp']",1,re of that subjection which we all owe to one another god almighty hath been pleased to put us into an imperfect state where we have perpetual occasion of each other s assistance there is none so low as not to be in a capacity of assisting the highest nor so high as not to want the assistance of the lowest it plainly appears from what hath been said that no one human creature is more worthy than another in the sight of god further than according to the goodness or holiness of their lives and that power wealth and the like outward advantages are so far from being the marks of god s approving or preferring those on whom they are bestowed that on the contrary he is pleased to suffer them to be almost engrossed by those who have least title to his favour now according to this equality wherein god hath placed all mankind with relation to himself you will observe that in all the relations between man and man there is a mutual dependence whereby the one cannot subsist without the other thus no man can be a prince without subjects nor a master without servants nor a father without children and this both explains and confirms the doctrine of the text for where there is a mutual dependence there must be a mutual duty and consequently a mutual subjection for instance the subject must obey his prince because god commands it human laws require it and the safety of the public makes it necessary for the same reasons we must obey all that are in authority and submit ourselves not only to the good and gentle but also to the froward whether they rule according to our liking or not on the other side in those countries that pretend to freedom princes are subject to those laws which their people have chosen they are bound to protect their subjects in liberty property and religion to receive their petitions and redress their grievances so that the best prince is in the opinion of wise men only the greatest servant of the nation not only a servant to the public in general but in some sort to every man in it in the like manner a servant owes obedience and diligence and faithfulness to his master from whom at the same time he hath a just demand for protection and maintenance and gentle treatment nay even the poor beggar hath a just demand of an alms from the rich man who is guilty of fraud injustice and oppression if he does not afford relief according to his abilities but this subjection we all owe one another is nowhere more necessary than in the common conversations of life for without it there could be no society among men if the learned would not sometimes submit to the ignorant the wise to the simple the gentle to the froward the old to the weaknesses of the young there would be nothing but everlasting variance in the world this our saviour himself confirmed by his own example for he appeared in the form of a servant and washed his disciples feet adding those memorable words ye call me lord and master and ye say well for so i am if i then your lord and master wash your feet how much more ought ye to wash one another s feet under which expression of washing the feet is included all that subjection assistance love and duty which every good christian ought to pay his brother in whatever station god hath placed him for the greatest prince and the meanest slave are not by infinite degrees so distant as our saviour and those disciples whose feet he vouchsafed to wash and although this doctrine of subjecting ourselves to one another may seem to grate upon the pride and vanity of mankind and may therefore be hard to be digested by those who value themselves upon their greatness or their wealth yet it is really no more than what most men practise upon other occasions for if our neighbour who is our inferior comes to see us we rise to receive him we place him above us and respect him as if he were better than ourselves and this is thought both decent and necessary and is usually called good manners now the duty required by the apostle is only that we should enlarge our minds and that what we thus practise in the common course of life we should imitate in all our actions and proceedings whatsoever since our saviour tells us that every man is our neighbour and since we are so ready in point of civility to yield to others in our own houses where only we have any title to govern having thus shown you what sort of subjection it is which all men owe one another and in what manner it ought to be paid i shall now draw some observations from what hath been said and first a thorough practice of this duty of subjecting ourselves to the wants and infirmities of each other would utterly extinguish in us the vice of pride for if god has pleased to intrust me with a talent not for my own sake but for the service of others and at the same time hath left me full of wants and necessities which others must supply i can then have no cause to set any extraordinary value upon myself or to despise my brother because he hath not the same talents which were lent to me his being may probably be as useful to the public as mine and therefore by the rules of right reason i am in no sort preferable to him secondly it is very manifest from what has been said that no man ought to look upon the advantages of life such as riches honour power and the like as his property but merely as a trust which god hath deposited with him to be employed for the use of his brethren and god will certainly punish the breach of that trust though the laws of man will not or rather indeed cannot because the trust was conferred only by god who has not left it to any power on earth to decide infallibly whether a man makes a good use of his talents or not or to punish him where he fails and therefore god seems to have more particularly taken this matter into his own hands and will most certainly reward or punish

of twelve new peers harley s job of using diverse elements to form a moderate government became more complex he found it expedient to establish and maintain influence with groups ranging from the radical tory october club to swift s country squire and clergy examiner readers to moderate whigs such as shrewsbury moreover defoe had impressed upon him the importance of assuring the nation that moderate and sensible men were at the bottom of all of the political changes harley therefore prepared for at least three apparently exclusive possibilities prosecuting the war for several more years negotiating a peace with the allies or making a separate peace with france without the allies to keep all these possibilities alive harley had to remain in harmony with marlborough the general s popularity with the soldiers and the european powers and france s awe of his military prowess necessitated the appearance that marlborough s command was secure while the examiner with its tory audience and its emphasis on pressure for peace was essential to harley so were swift s and defoe s appeals for moderation at a time when sympathy for marlborough was rampant and the call no peace without spain was still defended even by the october club for the same reasons he was glad to have bolingbroke openly associated with the examiner january of brought the decisive defeat at brihuega which effectively took the issue of spanish succession away in the ensuing witch hunt almanza and the peace talks of were revived to distract the people while these inquiries proceeded england received word that france was ready to discuss terms the delay between this february and france s formal proposal may was an anxious time for harley and his schemers defoe was busy setting the stage for the outcome while swift the high tory could easily set about discrediting marlborough the hero and standard bearer and by so doing weaken the whig s position defoe s readers required different handling his most effective writing at this time was in pamphlets which reached a wider audience and which were not bound by the consistency of the review defoe and swift primed with the minister s inside knowledge set about to discredit the whig ministry in basically the same way in the february examiner swift wrote no body that i know of did ever dispute the duke of marlborough s courage conduct or success they have been always unquestionable and will continue to be so in spight of the malice of his enemies or which is yet more the weakness of his advocates the nation only wished to see him taken out of ill hands and put into better but what is all this to the conduct of the late ministry the shameful mismanagements in spain or the wrong steps in the treaty of peace defoe remarks our general wants neither conduct or courage and describes his greatest successes as daughters to preserve his memory while dissociating him somewhat from the jacobites whigs and business of making peace and war when the review finally discusses marlborough s fall defoe suggests that the greatest guilt is the error in policy and prudence among his friends both writers presented the duke as a means to an end and discredited him on personal grounds avarice ambition thereby protecting the military hero and the newborn glory of england fathered by his victories faced with dissenters and moderate whig readers defoe s review had to seem to oppose swift s examiner with its sneers at trade not only must it be consistent but it was obliged to shift its readers attention more slowly to the earlier failures of the whig ministry and the rich commercial advantages gained in the separate peace the life of marlborough is part of a stream of pamphlets which defoe wrote supporting the harley administration a supplement to the faults on both sides a discussion of the sacheverell case by two displac d officers of state rogues on both sides a study in contrasts between old and new whigs and old high flyer and new tories and a seasonable caution to the general assembly were published immediately before and after that same year his pamphlets discuss the october club the spanish succession mr harley and the state of religion by summer when the peace was nearly assured though still secret defoe was writing reasons for a peace or the war at an end taken in chronological order defoe s pamphlets indicate two emerging directions first the reasons for ending the war become more positive and entirely unconcerned with the general and second defoe s comments about the duke become less wholeheartedly admiring especially in no queen or no general rogues on both sides is witty praise for moderate men who act according to english principles of law and liberty regardless of people and party rather than believing any demagogue who cries it rains butter d turnips after this the pamphlets become more informative and solemn defoe demonstrates whigs and tories want the same things and that the country bleeds to death armageddon or the necessity of carrying on the war october reasons why this nation ought to put a speedy end to this expensive war october and reasons for a peace or the war at an end for example catalog the economic ailments taxes pirates hard to replace sailors and soldiers killed but far worse a decline in trade resulting in closed shops and declining manufacturing increasing unemployment the whole kingdom sold to usury and consumption of the growth of the country as the year passed defoe mentioned marlborough less and less but the general s possible mistakes were progressively forced into balance with his victories while seeming to be moderate

them that were lost he is the physician of value that was wounded to heal our wounds he was wounded for our transgressions bruised for our iniquities and had the chastisement of our peace upon him that by his stripes we might be healed it is he alone that could do this who is sufficient for these things the lord found out one that is sufficient he hath laid help upon one that is mighty that is able to save to the uttermost all that come unto god by him god hath given him the spirit without measure and filled him with grace and truth that of his fullness we might all receive and grace for grace he is mighty to save the sons and daughters of men and to give them power to become the children of god this was testified of old john i but as many as received him to them gave he power to become the sons of god even to them who believe on his name men want power over their sins when sin appears to be exceeding sinful they would overcome it and be rid of it when it is troublesome and when they are under a deep conviction of the evil of it and see the woful and miserable state that sin hath brought mankind into how they have lost the image of god and the favour of god they then desire to be restored and brought back again into their primitive state you that know the truth of god see how the work goes on in your hearts see how the image of god is carrying on upon you consider that the lord is a holy god of purer eyes than to behold iniquity with approbation there is no peace to the wicked that walk in the broad way and grieve the holy spirit and do not answer his divine call there is a two fold call concerning man a call to repentance and a call to judgment the call to repentance is in this day of god s visitation they that receive it now that are so wise as to answer god s call and believe in the son of god and in his inward appearance that obey his voice when they hear his call saying come away come out of thy sins come out of the wickedness filthiness and pollution of the world come into the divine nature of the son of god come into his life into what life into the spiritual life the divine life thou hast been dead to god and alive to the world now

and salvation and receive power to overcome thy sins then thou wilt be a conqueror and overcome the devil we are of ourselves altogether insufficient for these things we are weak and impotent and our saviour hath told us without me ye can do nothing we are justified freely by god s grace through the redemption that is in jesus christ not justified by our own works how great a contradiction is it to charge them with the contrary that say they cannot preach nor pray but as the spirit of god moveth them blessed be god that hath made us sensible of our own weakness emptiness and poverty our help hath been in the name of the lord who made heaven and earth who hath given his son to be an helper and an all sufficient saviour to us with him he hath given sufficient power and strength whereby we are enabled to overcome the devil the enemy of our souls so that we may be enabled to stand against principalities and powers against spiritual wickedness and conquer all the powers of darkness and fight the good fight of faith and finish our course with joy and keep the faith seeing there is laid up for us a crown of righteousness which the lord the righteous judge shall give us at that day and not only to us saith the apostle but unto all them that love his appearing we have not an high priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities but was in all points tempted like as we are yet without sin christ our redeemer was tempted that he might succour those that are tempted when the devil tempted our saviour in the wilderness and could not prevail he went away and left him the prince of this world found nothing in him upon which he could fasten his temptation christ will enable those that believe in him to overcome the devil and to be more than conquerors through him that loved them he came into the world to purge and purify his people and to be the author of eternal salvation to all them that believe in him and obey him but it is said he did not many mighty works among some to whom he preached the everlasting gospel because of their unbelief many will not believe in the inward and spiritual appearance of jesus christ the son of god who is the light of the world they will neither believe in the light nor walk in the light which will enable them to conquer the evil one who is the prince of darkness it is only through christ jesus the great captain of our salvation that we are victorious therefore my friends open your hearts to the lord jesus christ receive this blessed gift of god which he offers to you and can god give you a greater gift than the son of his love and will not you gladly receive him and that great salvation which he hath purchased for you with his own blood but say some people we have received christ and believe in him and believe

where was a den and laid me down in that place to sleep and as i slept i dreamed a dream i dreamed and behold i saw a man clothed with rags standing in a certain place with his face from his own house a book in his hand and a great burden upon his back i looked and saw him open the book and read therein and as he read he wept and trembled and not being able longer to contain he brake out with a lamentable cry saying what shall i do bedford jail in which bunyan was twelve years a prisoner in this plight therefore he went home and restrained himself as long as he could that his wife and children should not perceive his distress but he could not be silent long because that his trouble increased wherefore at length he brake his mind to his wife and children and thus he began to talk to them oh my dear wife said he and you my sweet children i your dear friend am in myself undone by reason of a burden that lieth hard upon me moreover i am told to a certainty that this our city will be burned with fire from heaven in which fearful overthrow both myself with thee my wife and you my sweet babes shall miserably come to ruin except some way of escape can be found whereby we may be delivered at this all his family were sore amazed not for that they believed that what he had said to them was true but because they thought that some frenzy or madness had got into his head therefore it drawing towards night and they hoping that sleep might settle his brain with all haste they got him to bed but the night was as troublesome to him as the day wherefore instead of sleeping he spent it in sighs and tears so when the morning was come they would know how he did he told them worse and worse he also set to talking to them again but they began to be hardened they also thought to drive away his madness by harsh and surly treatment of him sometimes they would ridicule sometimes they would chide and sometimes they would quite neglect him wherefore he began to retire himself to his chamber to pray for and pity them and also to sorrow over his own misery he would also walk solitary in the fields sometimes reading and sometimes praying and thus for some days he spent his time sidenote christian s distress of mind now i saw upon a time when he was walking in the fields that he was as he was wont reading in his book and greatly distressed in his mind and as he read he burst out as he had done before crying what shall i do to be saved i saw also that he looked this way and that way as if he would run yet he stood still because as i perceived he could not tell which way to go i looked then and saw a man named evangelist coming to him who asked wherefore dost thou cry illustration evangelist points to wicket gate page he answered sir i read in the book in my hand that i am condemned to die and after that to come to judgment and i find that i am not willing to do the first nor able to do the second then said evangelist why not willing to die since this life is troubled with so many evils the man answered because i fear that this burden that is upon my back will sink me lower than the grave and i shall fall into tophet and sir if i be not fit to go to prison i am not fit to go to judgment and from thence to death and the thoughts of these things make me cry tophet here means hell then said evangelist if this be thy condition why standest thou still he answered because i know not whither to go then he gave him a parchment roll and there was written within flee from the wrath to come the man therefore read it and looking upon evangelist very carefully said whither must i fly then said evangelist pointing with his finger over a very wide field do you see yonder wicket gate the man said no then said the other do you see yonder shining light he said i think i do then said evangelist keep that light in your eye and go up directly thereto so shalt thou see the gate at which when thou knockest it shall be told thee what thou shalt do so i saw in my dream that the man began to run now he had not run far from his own door when his wife and children perceiving it began to cry after him to return but the man put his fingers in his ears and ran on crying life life eternal life so he looked not behind him but fled towards the middle of the plain sidenote christian flees from the city the neighbors also came out to see him run and as he ran some mocked others threatened and some cried after him to return and among those that did so there were two that resolved to fetch him back by force the name of the one was obstinate and the name of the other pliable now by this time the man was got a good distance from them but however they were resolved to pursue him which they did and in a little time they overtook him then said the man neighbors wherefore are ye come they said to persuade you to go back with us but he said that can by no means be you dwell said he in the city of destruction the place also where i was born i see it

cromwell died was fixed there for a monument of that monstrous creature it being at first about eight and twenty feet long according to my first intention of effectually viewing the sea coast of these three counties i went from stratford to barking a large market town but chiefly inhabited by fishermen whose smacks ride in the thames at the mouth of their river from whence their fish is sent up to london to the market at billingsgate by small boats of which i shall speak by itself in my description of london one thing i cannot omit in the mention of these barking fisher smacks viz that one of those fishermen a very substantial and experienced man convinced me that all the pretences to bringing fish alive to london market from the north seas and other remote places on the coast of great britain by the new built sloops called fish pools have not been able to do anything but what their fishing smacks are able on the same occasion to perform these fishing smacks are very useful vessels to the public upon many occasions as particularly in time of war they are used as press smacks running to all the northern and western coasts to pick up seamen to man the navy when any expedition is at hand that requires a sudden equipment at other times being excellent sailors they are tenders to particular men of war and on an expedition they have been made use of as machines for the blowing up of fortified ports and havens as at calais st malo and other places this parish of barking is very large and by the improvement of lands taken in out of the thames and out of the river which runs by the town the tithes as the townsmen assured me are worth above pounds per annum including small tithes note this parish has two or three chapels of ease viz one at ilford and one on the side of hainault forest called new chapel sir thomas fanshaw of an ancient roman catholic family has a very good estate in this parish a little beyond the town on the road to dagenham stood a great house ancient and now almost fallen down where tradition says the gunpowder treason plot was at first contrived and that all the first consultations about it were held there this side of the county is rather rich in land than in inhabitants occasioned chiefly by the unhealthiness of the air for these low marsh grounds which with all the south side of the county have been saved out of the river

wider till we come beyond tilbury when the flat country lies six seven or eight miles broad and is justly said to be both unhealthy and unpleasant however the lands are rich and as is observable it is very good farming in the marshes because the landlords let good pennyworths for it being a place where everybody cannot live those that venture it will have encouragement and indeed it is but reasonable they should several little observations i made in this part of the county of essex we saw passing from barking to dagenham the famous breach made by an inundation of the thames which was so

leicestershire wethers which they buy in smithfield in september and october when the lincolnshire and leicestershire graziers sell off their stock and are kept here till christmas or candlemas or thereabouts and though they are not made at all fatter here than they were when bought in yet the farmer or butcher finds very good advantage in it by the difference of the price of mutton between michaelmas when it is cheapest and candlemas when it is dearest this is what the butchers value themselves upon when they tell us at the market that it is right marsh mutton in the bottom of these marshes and close to the edge of the river stands the strong fortress of tilbury called tilbury fort which may justly be looked upon as the key of the river thames and consequently the key of the city

south seas a trade carried on with the greatest advantage and to the greatest degree that any particular commerce has been carried on in the world for many ages past insomuch that we found the return of silver that came back to france by those ships was not only the enriching of the merchants of st malo rochelle and other ports in france some of whom we saw get immense estates in a few years even to a million sterling a man but it was evident the king of france himself was enabled by the circulation of so much bullion through his mints to carry on that war with very great advantage it was just at the close of this war when some merchants of london looking with envy on the success of that trade and how the french notwithstanding the peace would apparently carry it on for some years at least to infinite advantage began to consider whether it might not be possible to come in for a portion of it with france as they were allied to spain and yet go abroad in the nature of a private cruiser to bring this to pass it was thought proper in the first place to get a share if possible in a new design of an east india trade in flanders just then intended to be set up by some british merchants by the assistance of an imperial charter or at least under colour of it and so we might go to sea in a threefold capacity to be made use of as occasion might present viz when on the coast of new spain we sought to trade we were frenchmen had a french captain and a sufficient number of french seamen and flemish or walloon seamen who spoke french so to appear on all proper occasions when at sea we met with any spanish ship worth our while we were english cruisers had letters of mart from england had no account of the peace and were fitted for the attack and when in the east indies we had occasion to trade either at the english or dutch settlements we should have imperial colours and two flemish merchants at least in appearance to transact everything as we found occasion however this last part of our project failed us that affair not being fully ripe as this mysterious equipment may be liable to some exceptions and perhaps to some inquiries i shall for the present conceal my name and that of the ship also by inquiries i mean inquiries of private persons concerned for as to public inquiries we have no uneasiness having acted nothing in contradiction to the rules and laws of our country but i say as to private persons it is thought fit to prevent their inquiries to which end the captain in whose name i write this gives me leave to make use of his name and conceal my own the ship sailed from the river the th of december and went directly over to the coast of flanders lying at an anchor in newport pitts as they are called where we took in our french captain jean michael merlotte who with thirty two french seamen came on board us in a large snow from dunkirk bringing with them one hundred and twenty two small ankers or rundlets of brandy and some hampers and casks of french wine in wickered bottles while we were here we lay under english colours with pendants flying our ship being upwards of five hundred ton and had forty six guns mounted manned with three hundred and fifty six men we took the more men on board because we resolved as occasion should present to fit ourselves with another ship which we did not question we should meet with in the south seas we had also a third design in our voyage though it may be esteemed an accident to the rest viz we were resolved to make some attempts for new discoveries as opportunity offered and we had two persons on board who were exceeding well qualified for our direction in this part all which was derived from the following occasion the person who was principally concerned in the adventure was a man not only of great wealth but of great importance he was particularly addicted to what we call new discoveries and it was indeed upon his genius to such things that the first thought of the voyage was founded this gentleman told me that he had already sent one ship fully equipped and furnished for a new attempt upon the north west or north east passages which had been so often in vain tried by former navigators and that he did not question the success because he had directed them by new measures and to steer a course that was never attempted yet and his design in our voyage was to make like discoveries towards the south pole where as he said and gave us very good reasons for it he did not doubt but we might discover even to the pole itself and find out new worlds and new seas which had never been heard of before with these designs this gentleman came into the other part of our project and contributed the more largely and with the more freedom to the whole upon that account in particular all the needful preparations for such discoveries were made wholly at his expense which i take notice of here as being most proper in the beginning of our story and that the reader may the less wonder at the particular way we took to perform a voyage which might with much more ease have been done by the usual and ordinary way we sailed from the coast of flanders the nd of january and without any extraordinary incident made the coast of galway in ireland the th where we stayed and took in a very extraordinary store of provisions three times as much as usual the beef being also well pickled or double packed that we might have a sufficient reserve for the length of our voyage resolving also to spare it as much as possible we had a very rich cargo on board consisting of all sorts of british manufactures suitable for the spanish trade in their west indies and as we aimed at nothing of trade till we came to the spanish coast we sailed directly

year they set off early in september with never a thought that any danger might menace their dear ones after so many years of peace and comparative prosperity the children had work in plenty to keep them from idleness during the week of ten days their fathers might be absent and no sooner had the little vessel sailed out of the harbor than they set about their several tasks in order that all the labor might be performed by the time the fishermen returned mark and luke were engaged in setting up the flakes or framework on which the fish were to be dried and this labor was performed near the shore of the harbor quite beyond sight of the homesteads with the high palisade which last hid from view all save the roofs of the buildings the future hopes which was the name of the small vessel belonging to the settlers had left her moorings when the first gray light of the coming day could be seen stealing over the waters and while she was yet close in shore the two lads set about building the flakes counting on completing the task within three days and to that end working so industriously as to give little or no heed to what might be passing around them therefore it was that they failed to see a canoe in which were five indians come swiftly up from the southward past what is now known as pulpit rock and sail straight for the island at the mouth of the harbor which the people of to day call bar island here the frail craft was hidden from view of the boys and when half an hour or more had gone by another canoe this one carrying six men executed the same maneuver five minutes later a third craft appeared but just as she came in view past the rock luke stood erect to drive in one of the stakes and therefore saw the strangers as they were evidently trying to steal by without being seen more than once since luke could remember had mount desert been visited by red men of the abenakis tribe but the visitors had always approached boldly like friends and this skulking from rock to island seemed much like a show of enmity certain it is that the lad was alarmed but he understood from what his father had said many times that it was not wise to let the indians know of his fear and continuing at the labor he said in a low tone to mark don t raise your head nor look around a canoe filled with abenakis has sneaked in behind the harbor island can it be mischief is intended they may be after rock cod and count on coming ashore later mark replied continuing his work in such a fashion that he could look seaward without seeming to do so at this moment the occupants of the last canoe were moving around the point of the island as if to gain a position where a full view of the buildings might be had for there could be no possibility the visitors were engaged in fishing of any other such peaceful pursuit there s trouble of some kind and it s for us to find out what mark said in a whisper there must have been other canoes than the one you saw for i have already counted eleven men on the island and they could not all have come in a single boat the boys had had no experience fortunately for them in indian warfare but they had heard enough from their parents to be fully alive to the possibilities and after a few moments during which time fear had held them speechless mark said in a low tone although there was no chance the enemy could have heard him we must get over to the house without seeming to be running away you start first and when you go through the gate call out that mother wants to see me luke obeyed leisurely although his heart was beating so loudly and heavily that it seemed as if it could be heard a long distance away and arriving at the palisade he summoned his brother as had been proposed then it was that mark was at liberty to leave his work and he answered the summons more quickly perhaps than ever before in his life mistress pemberton was busily engaged inside the house and the other two children were in a small garden directly in the rear of the building therefore the boys were able to impart the disagreeable tidings without alarming those who could be of little or no assistance indians skulking on the harbor island the good woman exclaimed when mark had hurriedly told his story and her face paled as the lads had never seen it before and they have chanced to come on the very day our father went fishing luke cried it wasn t chance that brought them my son unless coming for some evil purpose they would have landed boldly as they have done so many times it must be that the painted wretches have been watching to learn when your father and uncle left the island ask your aunt and susan to come over her the other children need not be told until it is no longer possible to hold them in ignorance of what may be done luke ran swiftly to the house which stood hardly more than fifty feet away and in a twinkling mistress harding and her daughter susan were where they could hear what to settlers in their situation was the worst possible news illustration indians skulking on the harbor island women who did their share in conquering the wilderness were not cowardly even though they might turn pale with apprehension when the first note of danger was sounded and there two knowing it was useless to expect aid from the outside lost no time in planning a defence the palisade was weak in many places more than one of the timbers had decayed and fallen for while the indians from the near by mainland were friendly disposed there seemed to be no good reason why time and labor should be expended upon

short time lived at ease but the death of his royal patron deprived him of a generous protector and opened a scene of sorrow which probably embittered his future life he had always discovered a great inclination to engage in religious controversy and the furious contest civil and ecclesiastical which ensued on the accession of queen anne gave him an opportunity of gratifying his favourite passion he therefore published a tract entitled the shortest way with the dissenters or proposals for the establishment of the church which contained an ironical recommendation of persecution but written in so serious a strain that many persons particularly dissenters at first mistook its real intention the high church party however saw and felt the ridicule and by their influence a prosecution was commenced against him and a proclamation published in the gazette offering a reward for his apprehension when de foe found with how much rigour himself and his pamphlet were about to be treated he at first secreted himself but his printer and bookseller being taken into custody he surrendered being resolved as he expresses it to throw himself upon the favour of government rather than that others should be ruined for his mistakes in july he was brought to trial found guilty and sentenced to be imprisoned to stand in the pillory and to pay a fine of two hundred marks he underwent the infamous part of the punishment with great fortitude and it seems to have been generally thought that he was treated with unreasonable severity so far was he from being ashamed of his fate himself that he wrote a hymn to the pillory which thus ends alluding to his accusers tell them the men that plac d him here are scandals to the times are at a loss to find his guilt and can t commit his crimes pope

newgate his family ruined and himself without hopes of deliverance till sir robert harley who approved of his principles and foresaw that during a factious age such a genius could be converted to many uses represented his unmerited sufferings to the queen and at length procured his release the treasurer lord godolphin also sent a considerable sum to his wife and family and to him money to pay his fine and the expense of his discharge gratitude and fidelity are inseparable from an honest man and it was this benevolent act that prompted de foe to support harley with his able and ingenious pen when anne lay lifeless and his benefactor in the vicissitude of party was persecuted by faction and overpowered though not conquered by violence the talents and perseverance of de foe began now to be properly estimated and as a firm supporter of the administration he was sent by lord godolphin to scotland on an errand which as he says was far from being unfit for a sovereign to direct or an honest man to perform his knowledge of commerce and revenue his powers of insinuation and above all his readiness of pen were deemed of no small utility in promoting the union of the two kingdoms of which he wrote an able history in with two dedications one to the queen and another to the duke of queensbury soon afterwards he unhappily by some equivocal writings rendered himself suspected by both parties so that he once more retired to newington in hopes of spending the remainder of his days in peace his pension being withdrawn and wearied with politics he began to compose works of a different kind the year may therefore be regarded as the period of de foe s political life faction henceforth found other advocates and parties procured other writers to disseminate their suggestions and to propagate their falsehoods in de foe published the family instructor a work inculcating the domestic duties in a lively manner by narration and dialogue and displaying much knowledge of life in the middle ranks of society religious courtship also appeared soon after which like the family instructor is eminently religious and moral in its tendency and strongly impresses on the mind that spirit of

supported than the adventures of robinson crusoe while it is carried on with that appearance of truth and simplicity which takes a strong hold of the imagination of all readers it suggests at the same

not only is the spirit of the institutions in harmony with these leases but so is the letter also men must draw a distinction between the spirit of the institutions and their own spirits the latter being often nothing more than a stomach that is not easily satisfied it would be just as true to affirm that domestic slavery is opposed to the institutions of the united states as to say the same of these leases it would be just as rational to maintain because a does not choose to make an associate of b that he is acting in opposition to the spirit of the institutions inasmuch as the declaration of independence advances the dogmas that men are born equal as it is to say it is opposed to the same spirit for b to pay rent to a according to his covenant it is pretended that the durable leases are feudal in their nature we do not conceive this to be true but admitting it to be so it would only prove that feudality to this extent is a part of the institutions of the state what is more it would become a part over which the state itself has conceded all power of control beyond that which it may remotely possess as one out of twenty eight communities as respects this feudal feature it is not easy to say where it must be looked for it is not to be found in the simple fact of paying rent for that is so general as to render the whole country feudal could it be true it cannot be in the circumstance that the rent is to be paid in kind as it is called and in labour for that is an advantage to the tenant by affording him the option since the penalty of a failure leaves the alternative of paying in money it must be therefore that these leases are feudal because they run for ever now the length of the lease is clearly a concession to the tenant and was so regarded when received and there is not probably a single tenant under lives who would not gladly exchange his term of possession for that of one of these detestable durable leases among the absurdities that have been circulated on this subject of feudality it has been pretended that the well known english statute of quia emptores has prohibited fines for alienation or that the quarter sales fifth sales sixth sales c of our own leases were contrary to the law of the realm when made under the common law in certain cases of feudal tenures the fines for alienation were an incident of the tenure the statute of quia emptores abolished that general principle but it in no manner forbade parties to enter into covenants of the nature of quarter sales did they see fit the common law gives all the real estate to the eldest son our statute divides the real estate among the nearest of kin without regard even to sex it might just as well be pretended that the father cannot devise all his lands to his eldest son under our statute as to say that the law of edward i prevents parties from bargaining for quarter sales altering a provision of the common law does not preclude parties from making covenants similar to its ancient provisions feudal tenures were originally divided into two great classes those which were called the military tenures or knight s service and soccage the first tenure was that which became oppressive in the progress of society soccage was of two kinds free and villian the first has an affinity to our own system as connected with these leases the last never existed among us at all when the knight s service or military tenures of england were converted into free soccage in the reign of charles ii the concession was considered of a character so favourable to liberty as to be classed among the great measures of the time one of which was the habeas corpus act the only feature of our own leases in the least approaching villian soccage is that of the day s works but every one acquainted with the habits of american life will understand that husbandmen in general throughout the northern states would regard it as an advantage to be able to pay their debts in this way and the law gives them an option since a failure to pay in kind or in work merely incurs the forfeiture of paying what the particular thing is worth in money in point of fact money has always been received for these day s works and at a stipulated price but it is pretended whatever may be the equity of these leasehold contracts they are offensive to the tenants and ought to be abrogated for the peace of the state the state is bound to make all classes of men respect its laws and in nothing more so than in the fulfilment of their legal contracts the greater the number of the offenders the higher the obligation to act with decision and efficiency to say that these disorganizers ought not to be put down is to say that crime is to obtain impunity by its own extent and to say that they cannot be put down under our form of government is a direct admission that the government is unequal to the discharge of one of the plainest and commonest obligations of all civilized society if this be really so the sooner we get rid of the present form of government the better the notion of remedying such an evil by concession is as puerile as it is dishonest the larger the concessions become the greater

put us into an imperfect state where we have perpetual occasion of each other s assistance there is none so low as not to be in a capacity of assisting the highest nor so high as not to want the assistance of the lowest it plainly appears from what hath been said that no one human creature is more worthy than another in the sight of god further than according to the goodness or holiness of their lives and that power wealth and the like outward advantages are so far from being the marks of god s approving or preferring those on whom they are bestowed that on the contrary he is pleased to suffer them to be almost engrossed by those who have least title to his favour now according to this equality wherein god hath placed all mankind with relation to himself you will observe that in all the relations between man and man there is a mutual dependence whereby the one cannot subsist without the other thus no man can be a prince without subjects nor a master without servants nor a father without children and this both explains and confirms the doctrine of the text for where there is a mutual dependence there must be a mutual duty and consequently a mutual subjection for instance the subject must obey his prince because god commands it human laws require it and the safety of the public makes it necessary for the same reasons we must obey all that are in authority and submit ourselves not only to the good and gentle but also to the froward whether they rule according to our liking or not on the other side in those countries that pretend to freedom princes are subject to those laws which their people have chosen they are bound to protect their subjects in liberty property and religion to receive their petitions and redress their grievances so that the best prince is in the opinion of wise men only the greatest servant of the nation not only a servant to the public in general but in some sort to every man in it in the like manner a servant owes obedience and diligence and faithfulness to his master from whom at the same time he hath a just demand for protection and maintenance and gentle treatment nay even the poor beggar hath a just demand of an alms from the rich man who is guilty of fraud injustice and oppression if he does not afford relief according to his abilities but this subjection we all owe one another is nowhere more necessary than in the common conversations of life for without it there could be no society among men if the learned would not sometimes submit to the ignorant the wise to the simple the gentle to the froward the old to the weaknesses of the young there would be nothing but everlasting variance in the world this our saviour himself confirmed by his own example for he appeared in the form of a servant and washed his disciples feet adding those memorable words ye call me lord and master and ye say well for so i am if i then your lord and master wash your feet how much more ought ye to wash one another s feet under which expression of washing the feet is included all that subjection assistance love and duty which every good christian ought to pay his brother in whatever station god hath placed him for the greatest prince and the meanest slave are not by infinite degrees so distant as our saviour and those disciples whose feet he vouchsafed to wash and although this doctrine of subjecting ourselves to one another may seem to grate upon the pride and vanity of mankind and may therefore be hard to be digested by those who value themselves upon their greatness or their wealth yet it is really no more than what most men practise upon other occasions for if our neighbour who is our inferior comes to see us we rise to receive him we place him above us and respect him as if he were better than ourselves and this is thought both decent and necessary and is usually called good manners now the duty required by the apostle is only that we should enlarge our minds and that what we thus practise in the common course of life we should imitate in all our actions and proceedings whatsoever since our saviour tells us that every man is our neighbour and since we are so ready in point of civility to yield to others in our own houses where only we have any title to govern having thus shown you what sort of subjection it is which all men owe one another and in what manner it ought to be paid i shall now draw some observations from what hath been said and first a thorough practice of this duty of subjecting ourselves to the wants and infirmities of each other would utterly extinguish in us the vice of pride for if god has pleased to intrust me with a talent not for my own sake but for the service of others and at the same time hath left me full of wants and necessities which others must supply i can then have no cause to set any extraordinary value upon myself or to despise my brother because he hath not the same talents which were lent to me his being may probably be as useful to the public as mine and therefore by the rules of right reason i am in no sort preferable to him secondly it is very manifest from what has been said that no man ought to look upon the advantages of life such as riches honour power and the like as his property but merely as a trust which god hath deposited with him to be employed for the use of his brethren and god will certainly punish the breach of that trust though the laws of man will not or rather indeed cannot because the trust was conferred only by god who has not left it to any power on earth to decide infallibly whether a man makes a good use of his talents or not or to punish him where he fails and therefore god seems to have more particularly taken this matter into his own hands and will most certainly reward or punish

negotiating a peace with the allies or making a separate peace with france without the allies to keep all these possibilities alive harley had to remain in harmony with marlborough the general s

see him taken out of ill hands and put into better but what is all this to the conduct of the late ministry the shameful mismanagements in spain or the wrong steps in the treaty of peace defoe remarks our general wants neither conduct or courage and describes his greatest successes as daughters to preserve his memory while dissociating him somewhat from the jacobites whigs and business of making peace and war when the review finally discusses marlborough s fall defoe suggests that the greatest guilt is the error in policy and prudence among his friends both writers presented the duke as a means to an end and discredited him on personal grounds avarice ambition thereby protecting the military hero and the newborn glory of england fathered by his victories faced with dissenters and moderate whig readers defoe s review had to seem to oppose swift s examiner with its sneers at trade not only must it be consistent but it was obliged to shift its readers attention more slowly to the earlier failures of the whig ministry and the rich commercial advantages gained in the separate peace the life of marlborough is part of a stream of pamphlets which defoe wrote supporting the harley administration a supplement to the faults on both sides a discussion of the sacheverell case by two displac d officers of state rogues on both sides a study in contrasts between old and new whigs and old high flyer and new tories and a seasonable caution to the general assembly were published immediately before and after that same year his pamphlets discuss the october club the spanish succession mr harley and the state of religion by summer when the peace was nearly assured though still secret defoe was writing reasons for a peace or the war at an end taken in chronological order defoe s pamphlets indicate two emerging directions first the reasons for ending the war become more positive and entirely unconcerned with the general and second defoe s comments about the duke become less wholeheartedly admiring especially in no queen or no general rogues on both sides is witty praise for moderate men who act according to english principles of law and liberty regardless of people and party rather than believing any demagogue who cries it rains butter d turnips after this the pamphlets become more informative and solemn defoe demonstrates whigs and tories want the same things and that the country bleeds to death armageddon or the necessity of carrying on the war october reasons why this nation ought to put a speedy end to this expensive war october and reasons for a peace or the war at an end for example catalog the economic ailments taxes pirates hard to replace sailors and soldiers killed but far worse a decline in trade resulting in closed shops and declining manufacturing increasing unemployment the whole kingdom sold to usury and consumption of the growth of the country as the year passed defoe mentioned marlborough less and less but the general s possible mistakes were progressively forced into balance with his victories while seeming to be moderate

was about to have the honour of crossing swords with one of the noblest gentlemen in france i pray you monsieur le marquis rejoined d roul de coldly to make the choice for me you see i have few

coats and the procedure in duels good natured foppish and idle he felt quite happy and in his element thus to be made chief organiser of the tragic farce about to be enacted on the parquet floor of the gaming saloon he looked about the room for a while scrutinising the faces of those around him the gilded youth was crowding round de marny a few older men stood in a group at the farther end of the room to these the marquis turned and addressing one of them an elderly man with a military bearing and a shabby brown coat mon colonel he said with another flourishing bow i am deputed by m d roul

prefer not to indeed i am entirely at m d roul de s service said the colonel who had thrown a quick scrutinising glance at the isolated figure near the card table if he will accept my services he will be very glad to accept my dear colonel whispered the marquis with an ironical twist of his aristocratic lips he has no friends in our set and if you and de quettare will honour him i think he should be grateful m de quettare adjutant to m le colonel was ready to follow in the footsteps of his chief and the two men after the prescribed salutations to m le marquis de villefranche went across to

d roul de the whole thing is a farce and that young man is a fool but i have been in the wrong and you would wish to apologise queried the colonel icily the worthy soldier had heard something of d roul de s reputed bourgeois ancestry this suggestion of an apology was no doubt in accordance with the customs of the middle classes but the colonel literally gasped at the unworthiness of the proceeding an apology bah disgusting cowardly beneath the dignity of any gentleman however wrong he might be how could two soldiers of his majesty s army identify themselves with such doings but d roul de seemed unconscious of the enormity of his suggestion if i could avoid a conflict he said i would tell the vicomte that i had no knowledge of his admiration for the lady we were discussing and are you so very much afraid of getting a sword scratch monsieur interrupted the colonel impatiently whilst m de quettare elevated a pair of aristocratic eyebrows in bewilderment at such an extraordinary display of bourgeois cowardice you mean monsieur le colonel queried d roul de that you must either fight the vicomte de marny to night or clear out of paris to morrow your position in our set would become untenable retorted the colonel not unkindly for in spite of d roul de s extraordinary attitude there was nothing in his bearing or his appearance that suggested cowardice or fear i bow to your superior knowledge of your friends m le colonel responded d roul de as he silently drew his sword from its sheath the centre of the saloon was quickly cleared the seconds measured the

to lay before us such prospects of national advantages and such views of prosperity as would be sufficient to prevail with those who have their eyes upon the good of their country and of their posterity after them that then a case so popular and of so much consequence as this is may not want such due supports as the nature of the thing will allow and especially since the advantages and good consequences of the thing itself are so many and so easy to be seen as his friends allege why should not the good people of britain be made easy and their fears be turned into peaceable satisfaction by seeing that this devil may not be so black as he is painted and that the noise made of the pretender and the frightful things said of his coming and of his being received here may not be made greater scarecrows to us than they really are and after all that has been said if it should appear that the advantages of the pretender s succession are really greater to us and the dangers less to us than those of the succession of hanover then much of their difficulties would be over who standing neuter as to persons appear against the pretender only because they are made to believe strange and terrible things of what shall befall the nation in case of his coming in such as popery slavery french power destroying of our credit and devouring our funds as that scandalous scribbler the review has been labouring to suggest with many other things which we shall endeavour to expose to you as they deserve if we say it should appear then that the dangers and disadvantages of the pretender s succession are less than those of the house of hanover who because of an act of parliament you know must not be called pretenders then there will remain nothing more to be said on that score but the debate must be of the reasonableness and justice on either side for their admittance and there we question not but the side we are really pleading for will have the advantage to begin then with that most popular and affrighting argument now made use of as the bugbear of the people against several other things besides jacobitism we mean french greatness it is most evident that the fear of this must by the nature of the thing be effectually removed upon our receiving the pretender the grounds and reasons why french greatness is rendered formidable to us and so much weight supposed to be in it that like the name of scanderberg we fright our very children with it lie only in this that we suggest the king of france being a professed enemy to the peace and the liberty of great britain will most certainly as soon as he can a little recover himself exercise all that formidable power to put the pretender upon us and not only to place him upon the throne of great britain but to maintain and hold him up in it against all the opposition either of the people of britain or the confederate princes leagued with the elector of hanover who are in the interest of his claim or of his party now it is evident that upon a peaceable admitting this person whom they call the pretender to receive and enjoy the crown here all that formidable power becomes your friend and the being so must necessarily take off from it everything that is called terrible forasmuch as the greater terror and amusement the power we apprehend really carries with it the greater is the tranquillity and satisfaction which accrues to us when we have the friendship of that power which was so formidable to us before the power of france is represented at this time very terrible and the writers who speak of it apply it warm to our imaginations as that from whence we ought justly to apprehend the impossibility of keeping out the pretender and this notwithstanding they allow themselves at the same time to suppose all the confederate powers of europe to be engaged as well by their own interest as by the new treaties of barrier and guarantee to support and to assist the claim of the elector of hanover and his party now if this power be so great and so formidable as they allege will it not on the other side add a proportion of increase to our satisfaction that this power will be wholly in friendship and league with us and engaged to concern itself for the quieting our fears of other foreign invaders forasmuch as having once concerned itself to set the person of the pretender upon the throne it cannot be supposed but it shall be equally concerned to support and maintain him in that possession as what will mightily conduce to the carrying on the other projects of his greatness and glory with the rest of europe in which it will be very much his interest to secure himself from any opposition he might meet with from this nation or from such as might be rendered powerful by our assistance an eminent instance we have of this in the mighty efforts the french nation have made for planting and preserving when planted a grandson of france upon the throne of spain and how eminent are the advantages to france from the success of that undertaking of what less consequence then would it be to the august monarchy of france to secure and engage to himself the constant friendship and assistance of the power of great britain which he would necessarily do by the placing this person upon the throne who would thereby in gratitude be engaged to contribute his utmost in return to the king of france for the carrying on his glorious designs in the rest of europe while then we become thus necessary to the king of france reason dictates that he would be our fast friend our constant confederate our ally firmly engaged to secure our sovereign and protect our people from the insults and attempts of all the world being thus engaged reciprocally with the king of france there must necessarily be an end of all the fears

thus one mr owen parry a welsh gentleman of good repute coming from bristol to padstow a little seaport in the county of cornwall near the place where dickory dwelt and hearing much of this dumb man s perfections would needs have him sent for and finding by his significant gestures and all outward appearances that he much exceeded the character that the country gave of him took a mighty liking to him insomuch that he told him if he would go with him into pembrokeshire he would be kind to him and take care of him as long as he lived this kind and unexpected offer was so welcome to poor dickory that without any farther consideration he got a pen and ink and writ a note and in a very handsome and submissive manner returned him thanks for his favour assuring him he would do his best to continue and improve it and that he would be ready to wait upon him whenever he should be pleased to command to shorten the account as much as possible all things were concluded to their mutual satisfaction and in about a fortnight s time they set forward for wales where dickory notwithstanding his dumbness behaved himself with so much diligence and affability that he not only gained the love of the family where he lived but of everybody round him in this station he continued till the death of his master which happened about twenty years afterwards in all which time as has been confirmed by several of the family he was never observed to be any ways disguised by drinking or to be guilty of any of the follies and irregularities incident to servants in gentlemen s houses on the contrary when he had any spare time his constant custom was to retire with some good book into a private place within call and there employ himself in reading and then writing down his observations upon what he read after the death of his master whose loss afflicted him to the last degree one mrs mary mordant a gentlewoman of great virtue and piety and a very good fortune took him into her service and carried him with her first to bath and then to bristol where after a lingering distemper which continued for about four years she died likewise upon the loss of his mistress dickory grew again exceeding melancholy and disconsolate at length reflecting that death is but a common debt which all mortals owe to nature and must be paid sooner or later he became a little better satisfied and so determines to get together what he had saved in his service and then to return to his native country and there finish his life in privacy and retirement having been as has been mentioned about twenty four years a servant and having in the interim received two legacies viz one of thirty pounds left him by his master and another of fifteen pounds by his mistress and being always very frugal he had got by him in the whole upwards of sixty pounds this thinks he with prudent management will be enough to support me as long as i live and so i ll e en lay aside all thoughts of future business and make the best of my way to cornwall and there find out some safe and solitary retreat where i may have liberty to meditate and make my melancholy observations upon the several occurrences of human life this resolution prevailed so far that no time was let slip to get everything in readiness to go with the first ship as to his money he always kept that locked up by him unless he sometimes lent it to a friend without interest for he had a mortal hatred to all sorts of usury or extortion his books of which he had a considerable quantity and some of them very good ones together with his other equipage he got packed up that nothing might be wanting against the first opportunity in a few days he heard of a vessel bound to padstow the very port he wished to go to being within four or five miles of the place where he was born when he came thither which was in less than a week his first business was to inquire after the state of his family it was some time before he could get any information of them until an old man that knew his father and mother and remembered they had a son was born dumb recollected him and after a great deal of difficulty made him understand that all his family except his youngest sister were dead and that she was a widow and lived at a little town called st helen s about ten miles farther in the country this doleful news we must imagine must be extremely shocking and add a new sting to his former affliction and here it was that he began to exercise the philosopher and to demonstrate himself both a wise and a good man all these things thinks he are the will of providence and must not be disputed and so he bore up under them with an entire resignation resolving that as soon as he could find a place where he might deposit his trunk and boxes with safety he would go to st helen s in quest of his sister how his sister and he met and how transported they were to see each other after so long an interval i think is not very material it is enough for the present purpose that dickory soon recollected his sister and she him and after a great many endearing tokens of love and tenderness he wrote to her telling her that he believed providence had bestowed on him as much as would support him as long as he lived and that if she thought proper he would come and spend the remainder of his days with her the good woman no sooner read his proposal than she accepted it adding withal that she could wish her entertainment was better but if he would accept of it as it was she would do her best to make everything easy and that he should be welcome upon his own terms to stay with her as long as he pleased this affair being so happily settled to his full satisfaction he returns to padstow to fetch the things he had left behind him and

because i know you have a fond brother oh says mrs veal i gave my brother the slip and came away because i had so great a desire to see you before i took my journey so mrs bargrave went in with her into another room within the first and mrs veal sat her down in an elbow chair in which mrs bargrave was sitting when she heard mrs veal knock then says mrs veal my dear friend i am come to renew our old friendship again and beg your pardon for my breach of it and if you can forgive me you are the best of women o says mrs bargrave do not mention such a thing i have not had an uneasy thought about it i can easily forgive it what did you think of me said mrs veal says mrs bargrave i thought you were like the rest of the world and that prosperity had made you forget yourself and me then mrs veal reminded mrs bargrave of the many friendly offices she did her in former days and much of the conversation they had with each other in the times of their adversity what books they read and what comfort in particular they received from drelincourt s book of death which was the best she said on that subject ever written she also mentioned dr sherlock the two dutch books which were translated written upon death and several others but drelincourt she said had the clearest notions of death and of the future state of any who had handled that subject then she asked mrs bargrave whether she had drelincourt she said yes says mrs veal fetch it and so mrs bargrave goes up stairs and brings it down says mrs veal dear mrs bargrave if the eyes of our faith were as open as the eyes of our body we should see numbers of angels about us for our guard the notions we have of heaven now are nothing like what it is as drelincourt says therefore be comforted under your afflictions and believe that the almighty has a particular regard to you and that your afflictions are marks of god s favour and when they have done the business they are sent for they shall be removed from you and believe me my dear friend believe what i say to you one minute of future happiness will infinitely reward you for all your sufferings for i can never believe and claps her hand upon her knee with great earnestness which indeed ran through most of her discourse that ever god will suffer you to spend all your days in this afflicted state but be assured that your afflictions shall leave you or you them in a short time she spake in that pathetical and heavenly manner that mrs bargrave wept several times she was so deeply affected with it then mrs veal mentioned dr kenrick s ascetick at the end of which he gives an account of the lives of the primitive christians their pattern she recommended to our imitation and said their conversation was not like this of our age for now says she there is nothing but frothy vain discourse which is far different from theirs theirs was to edification and to build one another up in faith so that they were not as we are nor are we as they were but says she we ought to do as they did there was an hearty friendship among them but where is it now to be found says mrs bargrave it is hard indeed to find a true friend in these days says mrs veal mr norris has a fine copy of verses called friendship in perfection which i wonderfully admire have you seen the book says mrs veal no says mrs bargrave but i have the verses of my own writing out have you says mrs veal then fetch them which she did from above stairs and offered them to mrs veal to read who refused and waived the thing saying holding down her head would make it ache and then desired mrs bargrave to read them to her which she did as they were admiring friendship mrs veal said dear mrs bargrave i shall love you for ever in these verses there is twice used the word elysian ah says mrs veal these poets have such names for heaven she would often draw her hand across her own eyes and say mrs bargrave do not you think i am mightily impaired by my fits no says mrs bargrave i think you look as well as ever i knew you after all this discourse which the apparition put in much finer words than mrs bargrave said she could pretend to and as much more than she can remember for it cannot be thought that an hour and three quarters conversation could all be retained though the main of it she thinks she does she said to mrs bargrave she would have her write a letter to her brother and tell him she would have him give rings to such and such and that there was a purse of gold in her cabinet and that she would have two broad pieces given to her cousin watson talking at this rate mrs bargrave thought that a fit was coming upon her and so placed herself in a chair just before her knees to keep her from falling to the ground if her fits should occasion it for the elbow chair she thought would keep her from falling on either side and to divert mrs veal as she thought took hold of her gown sleeve several times and commended it mrs veal told her it was a scowered silk and newly made up but for all this mrs veal persisted in her request and told mrs bargrave she must not deny her and she would have her tell her brother all their conversation when she had opportunity dear mrs veal says mrs bargrave this seems so impertinent that i cannot tell how to comply with it and what a mortifying story will our conversation be to a young gentleman why says mrs bargrave it is much better methinks to do it yourself no says mrs veal though it seems impertinent to you now you will see more reason for it hereafter mrs bargrave then to satisfy her importunity was going to fetch a pen and ink but

said he would not cease to pray for me yet he would venture to say to me that if i did take this foolish step god would not bless me and i should have leisure hereafter to reflect upon having neglected his counsel when there might be none to assist in my recovery i observed in this last part of his discourse which was truly prophetic though i suppose my father did not know it to be so himself x x i say i observed the tears run down his face very plentifully especially when he spoke of my brother who was killed and that when he spoke of my having leisure to repent and none to assist me he was so moved that he broke off the discourse and told me his heart was so full he could say no more to me i was sincerely affected with this discourse and indeed who could be otherwise and i resolved not to think of going abroad any more but to settle at home according to my father x x s desire but alas a few days wore it all off and in short to prevent any of my father x x s further importunities in a few weeks after i resolved to run quite away from him however i did not act quite so hastily as the first heat of my resolution prompted but i took my mother at a time when i thought her a little more pleasant than ordinary and told her that my thoughts were so entirely bent upon seeing the world that i should never settle to anything with resolution enough to go through with it and my father had better give me his consent than force me to go without it that i was now eighteen years old which was too late to go apprentice to a trade or clerk to an attorney that i was sure if i did i should never serve out my time but i should certainly run away from my master before my time was out and go to sea and if she would speak to my father to let me go one voyage abroad if i came home again and did not like it i would go no more and i would promise by a double diligence to recover the time that i had lost this put my mother into a great passion she told me she knew it would be to no purpose to speak to my father upon any such subject that he knew too well what was my interest to give his consent to anything so much for my hurt and that she wondered how i could think of any such thing after the discourse i had had with my father and such kind and tender expressions as she knew my father had used to me and that in short if i would ruin myself there was no help for me but i might depend i should never have their consent to it that for her part she would not have so much hand in my destruction and i should never have it to say that my mother was willing when my father was not though my mother refused to move it to my father yet i heard afterwards that she reported all the discourse to him and that my father after showing a great concern at it said to her with a sigh x x cthat boy might be happy if he would stay at home but if he goes abroad he will be the most miserable wretch that ever was born i can give no consent to it x x d it was not till almost a year after this that i broke loose though in the meantime i continued obstinately deaf to all proposals of settling to business and frequently expostulated with my father and mother about their being so positively determined against what they knew my inclinations prompted me to but being one day at hull where i went casually and without any purpose of making an elopement at that time but i say being there and one of my companions being about to sail to london in his father x x s ship and prompting me to go with them with the common allurement of seafaring men that it should cost me nothing for my passage i consulted neither father nor mother any more nor so much as sent them word of it but leaving them to hear of it as they might without asking god x x s blessing or my father x x s without any consideration of circumstances or consequences and in an ill hour god knows on the st of september i went on board a ship bound for london never any young adventurer x x s misfortunes i believe began sooner or continued longer than mine the ship was no sooner out of the humber than the wind began to blow and the sea to rise in a most frightful manner and as i had never been at sea before i was most inexpressibly sick in body and terrified in mind i began now seriously to reflect upon what i had done and how justly i was overtaken by the judgment of heaven for my wicked leaving my father x x s house and abandoning my duty all the good counsels of my parents my father x x s tears and my mother x x s entreaties came now fresh into my mind and my conscience which was not yet come to the pitch of hardness to which it has since reproached me with the contempt of advice and the breach of my duty to god and my father all this while the storm increased and the sea went very high though nothing like what i have seen many times since no nor what i saw a few days after but it was enough to affect me then who was but a young sailor and had never known anything of the matter i expected every wave would have swallowed us up and that every time the ship fell down as i thought it did in the trough or hollow of the sea we should never rise more in this agony of mind i made many vows and resolutions that if it would please god to spare my life in this one voyage if ever i got once my foot upon dry land again i would go directly home to my father and never set it into a ship again whil

year they set off early in september with never a thought that any danger might menace their dear ones after so many years of peace and comparative prosperity the children had work in plenty to keep them from idleness during the week of ten days their fathers might be absent and no sooner had the little vessel sailed out of the harbor than they set about their several tasks in order that all the labor might be performed by the time the fishermen returned mark and luke were engaged in setting up the flakes or framework on which the fish were to be dried and this labor was performed near the shore of the harbor quite beyond sight of the homesteads with the high palisade which last hid from view all save the roofs of the buildings the future hopes which was the name of the small vessel belonging to the settlers had left her moorings when the first gray light of the coming day could be seen stealing over the waters and while she was yet close in shore the two lads set about building the flakes counting on completing the task within three days and to that end working so industriously as to give little or no heed to what might be passing around them therefore it was that they failed to see a canoe in which were five indians come swiftly up from the southward past what is now known as pulpit rock and sail straight for the island at the mouth of the harbor which the people of to day call bar island here the frail craft was hidden from view of the boys and when half an hour or more had gone by another canoe this one carrying six men executed the same maneuver five minutes later a third craft appeared but just as she came in view past the rock luke stood erect to drive in one of the stakes and therefore saw the strangers as they were evidently trying to steal by without being seen more than once since luke could remember had mount desert been visited by red men of the abenakis tribe but the visitors had always approached boldly like friends and this skulking from rock to island seemed much like a show of enmity certain it is that the lad was alarmed but he understood from what his father had said many times that it was not wise to let the indians know of his fear and continuing at the labor he said in a low tone to mark don t raise your head nor look around a canoe filled with abenakis has sneaked in behind the harbor island can it be mischief is intended they may be after rock cod and count on coming ashore later mark replied continuing his work in such a fashion that he could look seaward without seeming to do so at this moment the occupants of the last canoe were moving around the point of the island as if to gain a position where a full view of the buildings might be had for there could be no possibility the visitors were engaged in fishing of any other such peaceful pursuit there s trouble of some kind and it s for us to find out what mark said in a whisper there must have been other canoes than the one you saw for i have already counted eleven men on the island and they could not all have come in a single boat the boys had had no experience fortunately for them in indian warfare but they had heard enough from their parents to be fully alive to the possibilities and after a few moments during which time fear had held them speechless mark said in a low tone although there was no chance the enemy could have heard him we must get over to the house without seeming to be running away you start first and when you go through the gate call out that mother wants to see me luke obeyed leisurely although his heart was beating so loudly and heavily that it seemed as if it could be heard a long distance away and arriving at the palisade he summoned his brother as had been proposed then it was that mark was at liberty to leave his work and he answered the summons more quickly perhaps than ever before in his life mistress pemberton was busily engaged inside the house and the other two children were in a small garden directly in the rear of the building therefore the boys were able to impart the disagreeable tidings without alarming those who could be of little or no assistance indians skulking on the harbor island the good woman exclaimed when mark had hurriedly told his story and her face paled as the lads had never seen it before and they have chanced to come on the very day our father went fishing luke cried it wasn t chance that brought them my son unless coming for some evil purpose they would have landed boldly as they have done so many times it must be that the painted wretches have been watching to learn when your father and uncle left the island ask your aunt and susan to come over her the other children need not be told until it is no longer possible to hold them in ignorance of what may be done luke ran swiftly to the house which stood hardly more than fifty feet away and in a twinkling mistress harding and her daughter susan were where they could hear what to settlers in their situation was the worst possible news illustration indians skulking on the harbor island women who did their share in conquering the wilderness were not cowardly even though they might turn pale with apprehension when the first note of danger was sounded and there two knowing it was useless to expect aid from the outside lost no time in planning a defence the palisade was weak in many places more than one of the timbers had decayed and fallen for while the indians from the near by mainland were friendly disposed there seemed to be no good reason why time and labor should be expended upon a means of defence which might never be needed and at this moment both the women bethought themselves of such fact there may be time in which to strengthen the fence mistress har

britain from the proud elevation on which it had been placed by the talents and enterprise of her former warriors and statesmen no longer dreaded by her enemies her servants were fast losing the

within the security of the largest towns in short the magnifying influence of fear began to set at naught the calculations of reason and to render those who should have remembered their manhood the slaves of the basest of passions even the most confident and the stoutest hearts began to think the issue of the contest was becoming doubtful and that abject class was hourly increasing in numbers who thought they foresaw all the possessions of the english crown in america subdued by their christian foes or laid waste by the inroads of their relentless allies when therefore intelligence was received at the fort which covered the southern termination of the portage between the hudson and the lakes that montcalm had been seen moving up the champlain with an army numerous as the leaves on the trees its truth was admitted with more of the craven reluctance of fear than with the stern joy that a warrior should feel in finding an enemy within reach of his blow the news had been brought towards the decline of a day in midsummer by an indian runner who also bore an urgent request from munro the commander of a work on the shore of the holy lake for a speedy and powerful reinforcement it has already been mentioned that the distance between these two posts was less than five leagues the rude path which originally formed their line of communication had been widened for the passage of wagons so that the distance which had been travelled by the son of the forest in two hours might easily be effected by a detachment of troops with their necessary baggage between the rising and setting of a summer sun the loyal servants of the british crown had given to one of these forest fastnesses the name of william henry and to the other that of fort edward calling each after a favorite prince of the reigning family the veteran scotchman just named held the first with a regiment of regulars and a few provincials a force really by far too small to make head against the formidable power that montcalm was leading to the foot of his earthen mounds at the latter however lay general webb who commanded the armies of the king in the northern provinces with a body of more than five thousand men by uniting the several detachments of his command this officer might have arrayed nearly double that number of combatants against the enterprising frenchman who had ventured so far from his reinforcements with an army but little superior in numbers but under the influence of their degraded fortunes both officers and men appeared better disposed to await the approach of their formidable antagonists within their works than to resist the progress of their march by emulating the successful example of the french at fort du quesne and striking a blow on their advance after the first surprise of the intelligence had a little abated a rumor was spread through the entrenched camp which stretched along the margin of the hudson forming a chain of outworks to the body of the fort itself that a chosen detachment of fifteen hundred men was to depart with the dawn for william henry the post at the northern extremity of the portage that which at first was only rumor soon became certainty as orders passed from the quarters of the commander in chief to the several corps he had selected for this service to prepare for their speedy departure all doubt as to the intention of webb

reverse direction by reducing the principles of mechanics to those of electricity and this especially as confidence in the strict validity of the equations of newton s mechanics was shaken by the experiments with beta rays and rapid kathode rays this dualism still confronts us in unextenuated form in the theory of hertz where matter appears not only as the bearer of velocities kinetic energy and mechanical pressures but also as the bearer of electromagnetic fields since such fields also occur in vacuo i e in free ether the ether also appears as bearer of electromagnetic fields the ether appears indistinguishable in its functions from ordinary matter within matter it takes part in the motion of matter and in empty space it has everywhere a velocity so that the ether has a definitely assigned velocity throughout the whole of space there is no fundamental difference between hertz s ether and ponderable matter which in part subsists in the ether the hertz theory suffered not only from the defect of ascribing to matter and ether on the one hand mechanical states and on the other hand electrical states which do not stand in any conceivable relation to each other it was also at variance with the result of fizeau s important experiment on the velocity of the propagation of light in moving fluids and with other established experimental results such was the state of things when h a lorentz entered upon the scene he brought theory into harmony with experience by means of a wonderful simplification of theoretical principles he achieved this the most important advance in the theory of electricity since maxwell by taking from ether its mechanical and from matter its electromagnetic qualities as in empty space so too in the interior of material bodies the ether and not matter viewed atomistically was exclusively the seat of electromagnetic fields according to lorentz the elementary particles of matter alone are capable of carrying out movements their electromagnetic activity is entirely confined to the carrying of electric charges thus lorentz succeeded in reducing all electromagnetic happenings to maxwell s equations for free space as to the mechanical nature of the lorentzian ether it may be said of it in a somewhat playful spirit that immobility is the only mechanical property of which it has not been deprived by h a lorentz it may be added that the whole change in the conception of the ether which the special theory of relativity brought about consisted in taking away from the ether its last mechanical quality namely its immobility how this is to be understood will forthwith be expounded the space time theory and the kinematics of the special theory of relativity were modelled on the maxwell lorentz theory of the electromagnetic field this theory therefore satisfies the conditions of the special theory of relativity but when viewed from the latter it acquires a novel aspect for if k be a system of co ordinates relatively to which the lorentzian ether is at rest the maxwell lorentz equations are valid primarily with reference to k but by the special theory of relativity the same equations without any change of meaning also hold in relation to any new system of co ordinates k which is moving in uniform translation relatively to k now comes the anxious question why must i in the theory distinguish the k system above all k systems which are physically equivalent to it in all respects by assuming that the ether is at rest relatively to the k system for the theoretician such an asymmetry in the theoretical structure with no corresponding asymmetry in the system of experience is intolerable if we assume the ether to be at rest relatively to k but in motion relatively to k the physical equivalence of k and k seems to me from the logical standpoint not indeed downright incorrect but nevertheless inacceptable the next position which it was possible to take up in face of this state of things appeared to be the following the ether does not exist at all the electromagnetic fields are not states of a medium and are not bound down to any bearer but they are independent realities which are not reducible to anything else exactly like the atoms of ponderable matter this conception suggests itself the more readily as according to lorentz s theory electromagnetic radiation like ponderable matter brings impulse and energy with it and as according to the special theory of relativity both matter and radiation are but special forms of distributed energy ponderable mass losing its isolation and appearing as a special form of energy more careful reflection teaches us however that the special theory of relativity does not compel us to deny ether we may assume the existence of an ether only we must give up ascribing a definite state of motion to it i e we must by abstraction take from it the last mechanical characteristic which lorentz had still left it we shall see later that this point of view the conceivability of which i shall at once endeavour to make more intelligible by a somewhat halting comparison is justified by the results of the general theory of relativity think of waves on the surface of water here we can describe two entirely different things either we may observe how the undulatory surface forming the boundary between water and air alters in the course of time or else with the help of small floats for instance we can observe how the position of the separate particles of water alters in the course of time if the existence of such floats for tracking the motion of the particles of a fluid were a fundamental impossibility in physics if in fact nothing else whatever were observable than the shape of the space occupied by the water as it varies in time we should have no ground for

on to the stone flagged terrace and looked out across the little bay below the top of the red sandstone cliff opposite was still wreathed with mists but the sunlight lay upon the tennis lawn the flower gardens below and the rocks almost covered by the full swelling tide tall and looking slimmer than ever in his plain dinner garb there were some indications of an hour of strange and unexpected suffering in the tired face of the man who gazed out in somewhat dazed fashion at the little panorama which he had been looking forward so eagerly to seeing again throughout the long journey down from town he had felt an unusual and almost boyish enthusiasm for his coming holiday he had thought of his tennis racquet and fishing rods wondered about his golf clubs and his guns even the unexpected encounter with miller had done little more than leave an unpleasant taste in his mouth and then on his way down from up over as the natives called that little strip of moorland overhead he had vanished into the mist and had come out into another world andrew so you are out here why did you not come to my room surely your train was very punctual tallente remained for a moment tense and motionless then he turned around the woman who stood upon the threshold of the house framed with a little cascade of drooping roses sought for his eyes almost hungrily he realised how she must be feeling a dormant vein of cynicism parted his lips as he held her fingers for a moment his tone and his manner were quite natural we were i believe unusually punctual he admitted what an extraordinary mist up over there was no sign of it at all she shivered her eyes were still watching his face seeking for an answer to her unasked question blue eyes they were which had been beautiful in their day a little hard and anxious now she wore a white dress simple with the simplicity of supreme and expensive art a rope of pearls was her only ornament her hair was somewhat elaborately coiffured there was a touch of rouge upon her cheeks and the unscreened evening sunlight was scarcely kind to her rather wan features and carefully arranged complexion she still had her claims to beauty however tallente admitted that to himself as he stood there appraising her with a strange and almost impersonal regard his wife of thirteen years she was beautiful notwithstanding the strained look of anxiety which at that moment disfigured her face the lurking fear which made her voice sound artificial the nervousness which every moment made fresh demands upon her self restraint it came up from the sea she said one moment tony and i were sitting out under the trees to keep away from the sun and the next we were driven shivering indoors it was just like running into a fog bank in the middle of the atlantic on a hot summer s day i found the difference in temperature amazing he observed i too dropped from the sunshine into a strange chill she tried to get rid of the subject so you lost your seat she said i am very sorry tell me how it happened he shrugged his shoulders the democratic party made up their mind for some reason or other that i shouldn t sit the labour party generally were not thinking of running a candidate i was to have been returned unopposed in acknowledgment of my work on the nationalisation bill the democrats however ratted they put up a man at the last moment and well you know the result i lost i don t understand english politics she confessed but i thought you were almost a labour man yourself i am practically he replied i don t know even now what made them oppose me what about the future my plans are not wholly made for the first time an old and passionate ambition prevailed against the thrall of the moment one of the papers this morning she said eagerly suggested that you might be offered a peerage i saw it he acknowledged it was in the sun i was once unfortunate enough to be on the committee of a club which blackballed the editor her mouth hardened a little but you haven t forgotten your promise bargain shall we call it he replied no i have not forgotten tony says you could have a peerage whenever you liked then i suppose it must be so just at present i am not prepared to write finis to my political career the butler announced dinner tallente offered his arm and they passed through the homely little hall into the dining room beyond stella came to a sudden standstill as they crossed the threshold why is the table laid for two only she demanded mr palliser is here i was obliged to send tony away on important business tallente intervened he left about an hour ago once more the terror was upon her the fingers which gripped her napkin trembled her eyes filled with fierce enquiry were fixed upon her husband s as he took his place in leisurely fashion and glanced at the menu obliged to send tony away she repeated i don t understand he told me that he had several days work here with you something intervened he murmured why didn t you wire

was seven years old large for his age a bold handsome lad with red hair mrs smith made a bargain with dick and led him back with her here panhandle took violent exception to having his pets killed or routed out by this boy he had never before seen he did not like his looks anyway but dick paid little heed to panhandle except once when mrs smith went into the house and then he knocked panhandle down for once panhandle did not squall he got up round eyed pale with his hands clenched he never said a word something was born in the depths of his gentle soul then dick tore a hole in the little wall of rocks that supported the porch and with a lighted torch on a stick he wormed his way in to rout out the skunks panhandle suddenly was thrilled and frightened by a bellowing from dick the boy came hurriedly backing out of the hole he fetched an odor with him that nearly suffocated panhandle so strange and raw and terrible was it dick s eyes were shut for the time being he had been blinded he bounced around like a chicken with its head cut off bawling wildly what had happened panhandle did not know but it certainly suited him goody goody he shouted holding his nose and edging away from the lad then panhandle saw smoke issuing from the hole under the porch the mother skunk and her kittens scampered out into the weeds he heard the crackle of flames that boy had dropped his torch under the porch screaming panhandle ran to alarm his mother but it was too late there were no men near at hand so nothing could be done panhandle stood crying beside his mother watching their little home burn to the ground somehow in his mind the boy dick had been to blame panhandle peered round to find him but he was gone never would panhandle forget that boy they walked to the uncle s house and spent the night there soon another home was under construction on the same site it was more of a shack than a house for building materials were scarce and the near approach of winter made hasty construction imperative winter came soon and panhandle and his mother were alone it was cold and they huddled over the little wood fire they had plenty to eat but were very uncomfortable in the one room shack bill smith came home but seldom that fall the valley had been overrun with homesteaders nesters they were called and these newcomers passed by often from the town drunk and rough panhandle used to lie awake a good deal during these lonely hours the moan of the prairie wind the mourn of wolves and yelp of coyotes became part of his existence he understood why his mother barred and blocked the one door placed the ax by the bed and the gun under her pillow even then he longed for the time when he would be old and big enough to protect her the lonely winter with its innumerable hours of solitude for mrs smith and the boy had incalculable influence upon his character she taught him much ways and things words and feelings that became an integral part of his life at last the long winter ended with spring came the gales of wind which though no longer cold were terrible in their violence many a night panhandle lay awake shrinking beside his mother fearing the shack would blow away over their heads many a day the sun was obscured and nothing could be cooked no work done while the dust storm raged as spring advanced with a lessening of the tornadoes a new and fascinating game came into panhandle s life it was to sit at the one little window and watch the cowboys ride by how he came to worship them they were on their way to the spring roundups his father had told him all about them panhandle would strain his eyes to get a first glimpse of them to count the shaggy prancing horses the lithe supple riders with their great sombreros their bright scarfs guns and chaps and boots and spurs their lassos how they fascinated panhandle ropes to whirl and throw at a running steer that was a game he resolved to play when he grew up and his mother discovering his interest made him a little reata and taught him how to throw it how to make loops and knots she told him how her people had owned horses thrown lassos run cattle panhandle was always watching for the cowboys when they passed by he would run to the other side of the shack where there was a knothole stuffed with a rag and through this he would peep until he was blinded by dust these were full days for the lad rousing in him wonder and awe eagerness and fear strange longings for he knew not what then one day his father brought home a black pony with three white feet and a white spot on his face panhandle was in rapture for him he could have burst for very joy but he could not speak it developed that his mother would not let him ride the pony except when she led it this roused as great a grief as possession was joy a beautiful little pony he could not ride ideas formed in his mind scintillated and grew into dark purpose one day he stole curly and led him out of sight behind the barn and mounting him rode down to the spring panhandle found himself alone he was free he was on the back of a horse mighty and incalculable fact curly felt the spirit of that occasion after drinking at the spring he broke into a lope panhandle stuck on somehow and turned the pony toward the house curly loped faster panhandle felt the wind in his hair he bounced up and down squealing with delight he twisted his hands in the flowing mane and held on at the top of the hill his joy became divided by fear curly kept on loping down the hill toward the house faster and faster panhandle bounced higher and higher up on his neck back on his haunches until suddenly his hold broke and he was thrown down

have awkward consequences darwin was given an imposing reputation as not only an evolutionist but as the evolutionist with the immense majority who never read his books the few who never read any others were led by them to concentrate exclusively on circumstantial selection as the explanation of all the transformations and adaptations which were the evidence for evolution and they presently found themselves so cut off by this specialization from the majority who knew darwin only by his spurious reputation that they were obliged to distinguish themselves not as darwinians but as neo darwinians before ten more years had elapsed the neo darwinians were practically running current science it was i was fifty i published my own view of evolution in a play called man and superman and i found that most people were unable to understand how i could be an evolutionist and not a neo darwinian or why i habitually derided neo darwinism as a ghastly idiocy and would fall on its professors slaughterously in public discussions it was in the hope of making me clear the matter up that the fabian society which was then organizing a series of lectures on prophets of the nineteenth century asked me to deliver a lecture on the prophet darwin i did so and scraps of that lecture which was never published variegate these pages political inadequacy of the human animal ten more years elapsed neo darwinism in politics had produced a european catastrophe of a magnitude so appalling and a scope so unpredictable that as i write these lines in it is still far from certain whether our civilization will survive it the circumstances of this catastrophe the boyish cinema fed romanticism which made it possible to impose it on the people as a crusade and especially the ignorance and errors of the victors of western europe when its violent phase had passed and the time for reconstruction arrived confirmed a doubt which had grown steadily in my mind during my forty years public work as a socialist namely whether the human animal as he exists at present is capable of solving the social problems raised by his own aggregation or as he calls it his civilization cowardice of the irreligious another observation i had made was that goodnatured unambitious men are cowards when they have no religion they are dominated and exploited not only by greedy and often half witted and half alive weaklings who will do anything for cigars champagne motor cars and the more childish and selfish uses of money but by able and sound administrators who can do nothing else with them than dominate and exploit them government and exploitation become synonymous under such circumstances and the world is finally ruled by the childish the brigands and the blackguards those who refuse to stand in with them are persecuted and occasionally executed when they give any trouble to the exploiters they fall into poverty when they lack lucrative specific talents at the present moment one half of europe having knocked the other half down is trying to kick it to death and may succeed a procedure which is logically sound neo darwinism and the goodnatured majority are looking on in helpless horror or allowing themselves to be persuaded by the newspapers of their exploiters that the kicking is not only a sound commercial investment but an act of divine justice of which they are the ardent instruments but if man is really incapable of organizing a big civilization and cannot organize even a village or a tribe any too well what is the use of giving him a religion a religion may make him hunger and thirst for righteousness but will it endow him with the practical capacity to satisfy that appetite good intentions do not carry with them a grain of political science which is a very complicated one the most devoted and indefatigable the most able and disinterested students of this science in england as far as i know are my friends sidney and beatrice webb it has taken them forty years of preliminary work in the course of which they have published several treatises comparable to adam smith s wealth of nations to formulate a political constitution adequate to existing needs if this is the measure of what can be done in a lifetime by extraordinary ability keen natural aptitude exceptional opportunities and freedom from the preoccupations of bread winning what are we to expect from the parliament man to whom political science is as remote and distasteful as the differential calculus and to whom such an elementary but vital point as the law of economic rent is a pons asinorum never to be approached much less crossed or from the common voter who is mostly so hard at work all day earning a living that he cannot keep awake for five minutes over a book is there any hope in education the usual answer is that we must educate our masters that is ourselves we must teach citizenship and political science at school but must we there is no must about it the hard fact being that we must not teach political science or citizenship at school the schoolmaster who attempted it would soon find himself penniless in the streets without pupils if not in the dock pleading to a pompously worded indictment for sedition against the exploiters our schools teach the morality of feudalism corrupted by commercialism and hold up the military conqueror the robber baron and the profiteer as models of the illustrious and the successful in vain do the prophets who see through this imposture preach and teach a better gospel the individuals whom they convert are doomed to pass away in a few years and the new generations are dragged back in the schools to the morality of the fifteenth century and think themselves liberal when they are defending the ideas of henry vii and

called his dratted speerits customer said tom in a harsh voice sorry to disturb you at your prayers guv nor but not having two pair of hands i can t serve a crowd meaning the old woman of the undergarments and myself mr potts slid off his stool and prepared for action when he saw however who the customer was he bristled that is the only word for it the truth is that although between us there was an inward and spiritual sympathy there was also an outward and visible hostility twice i had outbid mr potts at a local auction for articles which he desired moreover after the fashion of every good collector he felt it to be his duty to hate me as another collector lastly several times i had offered him smaller sums for antiques upon which he set a certain monetary value it is true that long ago i had given up this bargaining for the reason that mr potts would never take less than he asked indeed he followed the example of the vendor of the sibylline books in ancient rome he did not destroy the goods indeed after the fashion of that person and demand the price of all of them for the one that remained but invariably he put up his figure by per cent and nothing would induce him to take off one farthing what do you want sir he said grumpily vests hose collars or socks oh socks i think i replied at hazard thinking that they would be easiest to carry whereupon mr potts produced some peculiarly objectionable and shapeless woollen articles which he almost threw at me saying that they were all he had in stock now i detest woollen socks and never wear them still i made a purchase thinking with sympathy of my old gardener whose feet they would soon be scratching and while the parcel was being tied up said in an insinuating voice anything fresh upstairs mr potts no sir he answered shortly at least not much and if there were what s the use of showing them to you after the business about that clock it was you wanted for it mr potts i asked no sir it was and now it s per cent on to that you can work out the sum for yourself well let s have another look at it mr potts i replied humbly whereon with a grunt and a muttered injunction to tom to mind the shop he led the way upstairs now the house in which mr potts dwelt had once been of considerable pretensions and was very very old elizabethan i should think although it had been refronted with a horrible stucco to suit modern tastes the oak staircase was good though narrow and led to numerous small rooms upon two floors above some of which rooms were panelled and had oak beams now whitewashed like the panelling at least they had once been whitewashed probably in the last generation these rooms were literally crammed with every sort of old furniture most of it decrepit though for many of the articles dealers would have given a good price but at dealers mr potts drew the line not one of them had ever set a foot upon that oaken stair to the attics the place was filled with this furniture and other articles such as books china samplers with the glass broken and i know not what besides piled in heaps upon the floor indeed where mr potts slept was a mystery either it must have been under the counter in his shop or perhaps at nights he inhabited a worm eaten jacobean bedstead which stood in an attic for i observed a kind of pathway to it running through a number of legless chairs also some dirty blankets between the moth riddled curtains not far from this bedstead propped in an intoxicated way against the sloping wall of the old house stood the clock which i desired it was one of the first regulator clocks with a wooden pendulum used by the maker himself to check the time keeping of all his other clocks and enclosed in a chaste and perfect mahogany case of the very best style of its period so beautiful was it indeed that it had been an instance of love at first sight between us and although there was an estrangement on the matter of settlements or in other words over the question of price now i felt that never more could that clock and i be parted so i agreed to give old potts the or to be accurate s which he asked on the per cent rise principle thankful in my heart that he had not made it more and prepared to go as i turned however my eye fell upon a large chest of the almost indestructible yellow cypress wood of which were made it is said the doors of st peter s at rome that stood for eight hundred years and for aught i know are still standing as good as on the day when they were put up marriage coffer said potts answering my unspoken question italian about i suggested may be so or perhaps dutch made by italian artists but older than that for somebody has burnt on the lid with a hot iron not for sale not for sale at all much too good to sell just you look inside it the old key is tied to the spring lock never saw such poker work in my life gods and goddesses and i don t know what and venus sitting in the middle in a wreath of flowers with nothing on and holding

to england on saturday said mrs hignett she spoke a little wistfully she had not been parted from her son since he had come down from oxford and she would have liked to keep him with her till the end of her lecturing tour that however was out of the question it was imperative that while she was away he should be at windles nothing would have induced her to leave the place at the mercy of servants who might trample over the flower beds scratch the polished floors and forget to cover up the canary at night he sails on the atlantic that s splendid said sam i m sailing on the atlantic myself i ll go down to the office and see if we can t have a state room together but where is he going to live when he gets to england where is he going to live why at windles of course where else but i thought you were letting windles for the summer mrs hignett stared letting windles she spoke as one might address a lunatic what put that extraordinary idea into your head i thought father said something about your letting the place to some american nothing of the kind it seemed to sam that his aunt spoke somewhat vehemently even snappishly in correcting what was a perfectly natural mistake he could not know that the subject of letting windles for the summer was one which had long since begun to infuriate mrs hignett people had certainly asked her to let windles in fact people had pestered her there was a rich fat man an american named bennett whom she had met just before sailing at her brother s house in london invited down to windles for the day mr bennett had fallen in love with the place and had begged her to name her own price not content with this he had pursued her with his pleadings by means of the wireless telegraph while she was on the ocean and had not given up the struggle even when she reached new york he had egged on a friend of his a mr mortimer to continue the persecution in that city and this very morning among the letters on mrs hignett s table the buff envelope of a cable from mr bennett had peeped out nearly spoiling her breakfast no wonder then that sam s allusion to the affair had caused the authoress of the spreading light momentarily to lose her customary calm nothing will induce me ever to let windles she said with finality and rose significantly sam perceiving that the audience was at an end and glad of it also got up well i think i ll be going down and seeing about that state room

was seven years old large for his age a bold handsome lad with red hair mrs smith made a bargain with dick and led him back with her here panhandle took violent exception to having his pets killed or routed out by this boy he had never before seen he did not like his looks anyway but dick paid little heed to panhandle except once when mrs smith went into the house and then he knocked panhandle down for once panhandle did not squall he got up round eyed pale with his hands clenched he never said a word something was born in the depths of his gentle soul then dick tore a hole in the little wall of rocks that supported the porch and with a lighted torch on a stick he wormed his way in to rout out the skunks panhandle suddenly was thrilled and frightened by a bellowing from dick the boy came hurriedly backing out of the hole he fetched an odor with him that nearly suffocated panhandle so strange and raw and terrible was it dick s eyes were shut for the time being he had been blinded he bounced around like a chicken with its head cut off bawling wildly what had happened panhandle did not know but it certainly suited him goody goody he shouted holding his nose and edging away from the lad then panhandle saw smoke issuing from the hole under the porch the mother skunk and her kittens scampered out into the weeds he heard the crackle of flames that boy had dropped his torch under the porch screaming panhandle ran to alarm his mother but it was too late there were no men near at hand so nothing could be done panhandle stood crying beside his mother watching their little home burn to the ground somehow in his mind the boy dick had been to blame panhandle peered round to find him but he was gone never would panhandle forget that boy they walked to the uncle s house and spent the night there soon another home was under construction on the same site it was more of a shack than a house for building materials were scarce and the near approach of winter made hasty construction imperative winter came soon and panhandle and his mother were alone it was cold and they huddled over the little wood fire they had plenty to eat but were very uncomfortable in the one room shack bill smith came home but seldom that fall the valley had been overrun with homesteaders nesters they were called and these newcomers passed by often from the town drunk and rough panhandle used to lie awake a good deal during these lonely hours the moan of the prairie wind the mourn of wolves and yelp of coyotes became part of his existence he understood why his mother barred and blocked the one door placed the ax by the bed and the gun under her pillow even then he longed for the time when he would be old and big enough to protect her the lonely winter with its innumerable hours of solitude for mrs smith and the boy had incalculable influence upon his character she taught him much ways and things words and feelings that became an integral part of his life at last the long winter ended with spring came the gales of wind which though no longer cold were terrible in their violence many a night panhandle lay awake shrinking beside his mother fearing the shack would blow away over their heads many a day the sun was obscured and nothing could be cooked no work done while the dust storm raged as spring advanced with a lessening of the tornadoes a new and fascinating game came into panhandle s life it was to sit at the one little window and watch the cowboys ride by how he came to worship them they were on their way to the spring roundups his father had told him all about them panhandle would strain his eyes to get a first glimpse of them to count the shaggy prancing horses the lithe supple riders with their great sombreros their bright scarfs guns and chaps and boots and spurs their lassos how they fascinated panhandle ropes to whirl and throw at a running steer that was a game he resolved to play when he grew up and his mother discovering his interest made him a little reata and taught him how to throw it how to make loops and knots she told him how her people had owned horses thrown lassos run cattle panhandle was always watching for the cowboys when they passed by he would run to the other side of the shack where there was a knothole stuffed with a rag and through this he would peep until he was blinded by dust these were full days for the lad rousing in him wonder and awe eagerness and fear strange longings for he knew not what then one day his father brought home a black pony with three white feet and a white spot on his face panhandle was in rapture for him he could have burst for very joy but he could not speak it developed that his mother would not let him ride the pony except when she led it this roused as great a grief as possession was joy a beautiful little pony he could not ride ideas formed in his mind scintillated and grew into dark purpose one day he stole curly and led him out of sight behind the barn and mounting him rode down to the spring panhandle found himself alone he was free he was on the back of a horse mighty and incalculable fact curly felt the spirit of that occasion after drinking at the spring he broke into a lope panhandle stuck on somehow and turned the pony toward the house curly loped faster panhandle felt the wind in his hair he bounced up and down squealing with delight he twisted his hands in the flowing mane and held on at the top of the hill his joy became divided by fear curly kept on loping down the hill toward the house faster and faster panhandle bounced higher and higher up on his neck back on his haunches until suddenly his hold broke and he was thrown down

reverse direction by reducing the principles of mechanics to those of electricity and this especially as confidence in the strict validity of the equations of newton s mechanics was shaken by the experiments with beta rays and rapid kathode rays this dualism still confronts us in unextenuated form in the theory of hertz where matter appears not only as the bearer of velocities kinetic energy and mechanical pressures but also as the bearer of electromagnetic fields since such fields also occur in vacuo i e in free ether the ether also appears as bearer of electromagnetic fields the ether appears indistinguishable in its functions from ordinary matter within matter it takes part in the motion of matter and in empty space it has everywhere a velocity so that the ether has a definitely assigned velocity throughout the whole of space there is no fundamental difference between hertz s ether and ponderable matter which in part subsists in the ether the hertz theory suffered not only from the defect of ascribing to matter and ether on the one hand mechanical states and on the other hand electrical states which do not stand in any conceivable relation to each other it was also at variance with the result of fizeau s important experiment on the velocity of the propagation of light in moving fluids and with other established experimental results such was the state of things when h a lorentz entered upon the scene he brought theory into harmony with experience by means of a wonderful simplification of theoretical principles he achieved this the most important advance in the theory of electricity since maxwell by taking from ether its mechanical and from matter its electromagnetic qualities as in empty space so too in the interior of material bodies the ether and not matter viewed atomistically was exclusively the seat of electromagnetic fields according to lorentz the elementary particles of matter alone are capable of carrying out movements their electromagnetic activity is entirely confined to the carrying of electric charges thus lorentz succeeded in reducing all electromagnetic happenings to maxwell s equations for free space as to the mechanical nature of the lorentzian ether it may be said of it in a somewhat playful spirit that immobility is the only mechanical property of which it has not been deprived by h a lorentz it may be added that the whole change in the conception of the ether which the special theory of relativity brought about consisted in taking away from the ether its last mechanical quality namely its immobility how this is to be understood will forthwith be expounded the space time theory and the kinematics of the special theory of relativity were modelled on the maxwell lorentz theory of the electromagnetic field this theory therefore satisfies the conditions of the special theory of relativity but when viewed from the latter it acquires a novel aspect for if k be a system of co ordinates relatively to which the lorentzian ether is at rest the maxwell lorentz equations are valid primarily with reference to k but by the special theory of relativity the same equations without any change of meaning also hold in relation to any new system of co ordinates k which is moving in uniform translation relatively to k now comes the anxious question why must i in the theory distinguish the k system above all k systems which are physically equivalent to it in all respects by assuming that the ether is at rest relatively to the k system for the theoretician such an asymmetry in the theoretical structure with no corresponding asymmetry in the system of experience is intolerable if we assume the ether to be at rest relatively to k but in motion relatively to k the physical equivalence of k and k seems to me from the logical standpoint not indeed downright incorrect but nevertheless inacceptable the next position which it was possible to take up in face of this state of things appeared to be the following the ether does not exist at all the electromagnetic fields are not states of a medium and are not bound down to any bearer but they are independent realities which are not reducible to anything else exactly like the atoms of ponderable matter this conception suggests itself the more readily as according to lorentz s theory electromagnetic radiation like ponderable matter brings impulse and energy with it and as according to the special theory of relativity both matter and radiation are but special forms of distributed energy ponderable mass losing its isolation and appearing as a special form of energy more careful reflection teaches us however that the special theory of relativity does not compel us to deny ether we may assume the existence of an ether only we must give up ascribing a definite state of motion to it i e we must by abstraction take from it the last mechanical characteristic which lorentz had still left it we shall see later that this point of view the conceivability of which i shall at once endeavour to make more intelligible by a somewhat halting comparison is justified by the results of the general theory of relativity think of waves on the surface of water here we can describe two entirely different things either we may observe how the undulatory surface forming the boundary between water and air alters in the course of time or else with the help of small floats for instance we can observe how the position of the separate particles of water alters in the course of time if the existence of such floats for tracking the motion of the particles of a fluid were a fundamental impossibility in physics if in fact nothing else whatever were observable than the shape of the space occupied by the water as it varies in time we should have no ground for

with disgust with rage with melancholy and even with self contempt but even at the worst i had an uneasy consciousness that i would have to go back to them an outcast of the islands belongs to those novels of mine that were never laid aside and though it brought me the qualification of exotic writer i don t think the charge was at all justified for the life of me i don t see that there is the slightest exotic spirit in the conception or style of that novel it is certainly the most tropical of my eastern tales the mere scenery got a great hold on me as i went on perhaps because i may just as well confess that the story itself was never very near my heart it engaged my imagination much more than my affection as to my feeling for willems it was but the regard one cannot help having for one s own creation obviously i could not be indifferent to a man on whose head i had brought so much evil simply by imagining him such as he appears in the novel and that too on a very slight foundation the man who suggested willems to me was not particularly interesting in himself my interest was aroused by his dependent position his strange dubious status of a mistrusted disliked worn out european living on the reluctant toleration of that settlement hidden in the heart of the forest land up that sombre stream which our ship was the only white men s ship to visit with his hollow clean shaved cheeks a heavy grey moustache and eyes without any expression whatever clad always in a spotless sleeping suit much befrogged in front which left his lean neck wholly uncovered and with his bare feet in a pair of straw slippers he wandered silently amongst the houses in daylight almost as dumb as an animal and apparently much more homeless i don t know what he did with himself at night he must have had a place a hut a palm leaf shed some sort of hovel where he kept his razor and his change of sleeping suits an air of futile mystery hung over him something not exactly dark but obviously ugly the only definite statement i could extract from anybody was that it was he who had brought the arabs into the river that must have happened many years before but how did he bring them into the river he could hardly have done it in his arms like a lot of kittens i knew that almayer founded the chronology of all his misfortunes on the date of that fateful advent and yet the very first time we dined with almayer there was willems sitting at table with us in the manner of the skeleton at the feast obviously shunned by everybody never addressed by any one and for all recognition of his existence getting now and then from almayer a venomous glance which i observed with great surprise in the course of the whole evening he ventured one single remark which i didn t catch because his articulation was imperfect as of a man who had forgotten how to speak i was the only person who seemed aware of the sound willems subsided presently he retired pointedly unnoticed into the forest maybe its immensity was there within three hundred yards of the verandah ready to swallow up anything almayer conversing with my captain did not stop talking while he glared angrily at the retreating back didn t that fellow bring the arabs into the river nevertheless willems turned up next morning on almayer s verandah from the bridge of the steamer i could see plainly these two breakfasting together t te xa t te and i suppose in dead silence one with his air of being no longer interested in this world and the other raising his eyes now and then with intense dislike it was clear that in those days willems lived on almayer s charity yet on returning two months later to sambir i heard that he had gone on an expedition up the river in charge of a steam launch belonging to the arabs to make some discovery or other on account of the strange reluctance that everyone manifested to talk about willems it was impossible for me to get at the rights of that transaction moreover i was a newcomer the youngest of the company and i suspect not judged quite fit as yet for a full confidence i was not much concerned about that exclusion the faint suggestion of plots and mysteries pertaining to all matters touching almayer s affairs amused me vastly almayer was obviously very much affected i believe he missed willems immensely he wore an air of sinister preoccupation and talked confidentially with my captain i could catch only snatches of mumbled sentences then one morning as i came along the deck to take my place at the breakfast table almayer checked himself in his low toned discourse my captain s face was perfectly impenetrable there was a moment of profound silence and then as if unable to contain himself almayer burst out in a loud vicious tone one thing s certain if he finds anything worth having up there they will poison him like a dog disconnected though it was that phrase as food for thought was distinctly worth hearing we left the river three days afterwards and i never returned to sambir but whatever happened to the protagonist of my willems nobody can deny that i have recorded for him a less squalid fate j c nigger of the narcissus to my readers in america from that evening when james wait joined the ship late for the muster of the crew to the moment when he left us in the open sea shrouded in sailcloth through the open port i had much to do with him he was in my watch a negro in a british forecastle is a lonely being he has no chums yet james wait afraid of death and making her his accomplice was an impostor of some character mastering our compassion scornful of our sentimentalism triumphing over our suspicions but in the book he is nothing he is merely the centre of the ship s collective psychology and the pivot

distinctively social aspects of london the general artlessly histrionised air of things caused so many examples to spring from behind any hedge what came up however at once for my own stretched canvas was that it would have to be ample give me really space to turn round and that a single illustrative case might easily be meagre fare the young man who should chuck admired politics and of course some other admired object with them would be all very well but he wouldn t be enough therefore what should one say to some other young man who would chuck something and somebody else admired in their way too there need never at the worst be any difficulty about the things advantageously chuckable for art the question is all but of choosing them in the heap yet were i to represent a struggle an interesting one indispensably with the passions of the theatre as a profession or at least as an absorption i should have to place the theatre in another light than the satiric this however would by good luck be perfectly possible too without a sacrifice of truth and i should doubtless even be able to make my theatric case as important as i might desire it it seemed clear that i needed big cases small ones would practically give my central idea away and i make out now my still labouring under the illusion that the case of the sacrifice for art can ever be with truth with taste with discretion involved apparently and showily big i daresay it glimmered upon me even then that the very sharpest difficulty of the victim of the conflict i should seek to represent and the very highest interest of his predicament dwell deep in the fact that his repudiation of the great obvious great moral or functional or useful character shall just have to consent to resemble a surrender for absolutely nothing those characters are all large and expansive seated and established and endowed whereas the most charming truth about the preference for art is that to parade abroad so thoroughly inward and so naturally embarrassed a matter is to falsify and vulgarise it that as a preference attended with the honours of publicity it is indeed nowhere that in fact under the rule of its sincerity its only honours are those of contradiction concentration and a seemingly deplorable indifference to everything but itself nothing can well figure as less big in an honest thesis than a marked instance of somebody s willingness to pass mainly for an ass of these things i must i say have been in strictness aware what i perhaps failed of was to note that if a certain romantic glamour even that of mere eccentricity or of a fine perversity may be flung over the act of exchange of a career for the esthetic life in general the prose and the modesty of the matter yet come in with any exhibition of the particular branch of esthetics selected then it is that the attitude of hero or heroine may look too much for the romantic effect like a low crouching over proved trifles art indeed has in our day taken on so many honours and emoluments that the recognition of its importance is more than a custom has become on occasion almost a fury the line is drawn especially in the english world only at the importance of heeding what it may mean the more i turn my pieces over at any rate the more i now see i must have found in them and i remember how once well in presence of my three typical examples my fear of too ample a canvas quite dropped the only question was that if i had marked my political case from so far back for a story by itself and then marked my theatrical case for another the joining together of these interests originally seen as separate might all disgracefully betray the seam show for mechanical and superficial a story was a story a picture a picture and i had a mortal horror of two stories two pictures in one the reason of this was the clearest my subject was immediately under that disadvantage so cheated of its indispensable centre as to become of no more use for expressing a main intention than a wheel without a hub is of use for moving a cart it was a fact apparently that one had on occasion seen two pictures in one were there not for instance certain sublime tintorettos at venice a measureless crucifixion in especial which showed without loss of authority half a dozen actions separately taking place yes that might be but there had surely been nevertheless a mighty pictorial fusion so that the virtue of composition had somehow thereby come all mysteriously to its own of course the affair would be simple enough if composition could be kept out of the question yet by what art or process what bars and bolts what unmuzzled dogs and pointed guns perform that feat i had to know myself utterly inapt for any such valour and recognise that to make it possible sundry things should have begun for me much further back than i had felt them even in their dawn a picture without composition slights its most precious chance for beauty and is moreover not composed at all unless the painter knows how that principle of health and safety working as an absolutely premeditated art has prevailed there may in its absence be life incontestably as the newcomes has life as les trois mousquetaires as tolstoi s peace and war have it but what do such large loose baggy monsters with their queer elements of the accidental and the arbitrary artistically mean we have heard it maintained we well remember that such things are superior to art but we understand least of all what that may mean and we look in vain for the artist the divine explanatory genius who

had her like a ruddy fire into which he could cast himself for rejuvenation ah that it might never end this passion this marriage the flame of their two bodies burnt again into that old cottage that was haunted already by so much by gone physical desire you could not be in the dark room for an hour without the influences coming over you the hot blood desire of by gone yeomen there in this old den where they had lusted and bred for so many generations the silent house dark with thick timbered walls and the big black chimney place and the sense of secrecy dark with low little windows sunk into the earth dark like a lair where strong beasts had lurked and mated lonely at night and lonely by day left to themselves and their own intensity for so many generations it seemed to cast a spell on the two young people they became different there was a curious secret glow about them a certain slumbering flame hard to understand that enveloped them both they too felt that they did not belong to the london world any more crockham had changed their blood the sense of the snakes that lived and slept even in their own garden in the sun so that he going forward with the spade would see a curious coiled brownish pile on the black soil which suddenly would start up hiss and dazzle rapidly away hissing one day winifred heard the strangest scream from the flower bed under the low window of the living room ah the strangest scream like the very soul of the dark past crying aloud she ran out and saw a long brown snake on the flower bed and in its flat mouth the one hind leg of a frog was striving to escape and screaming its strange tiny bellowing scream she looked at the snake and from its sullen flat head it looked at her obstinately she gave a cry and it released the frog and slid angrily away that was crockham the spear of modern invention had not passed through it and it lay there secret primitive savage as when the saxons first came and egbert and she were caught there caught out of the world he was not idle nor was she there were plenty of things to be done the house to be put into final repair after the workmen had gone cushions and curtains to sew the paths to make the water to fetch and attend to and then the slope of the deep soiled neglected garden to level to terrace with little terraces and paths and to fill with flowers he worked away in his shirt sleeves worked all day intermittently doing this thing and the other and she quiet and rich in herself seeing him stooping and labouring away by himself would come to help him to be near him he of course was an amateur a born amateur he worked so hard and did so little and nothing he ever did would hold together for long if he terraced the garden he held up the earth with a couple of long narrow planks that soon began to bend with the pressure from behind and would not need many years to rot through and break and let the soil slither all down again in a heap towards the stream bed but there you are he had not been brought up to come to grips with anything and he thought it would do nay he did not think there was anything else except little temporary contrivances possible he who had such a passion for his old enduring cottage and for the old enduring things of the bygone england curious that the sense of permanency in the past had such a hold over him whilst in the present he was all amateurish and sketchy winifred could not criticize him town bred everything seemed to her splendid and the very digging and shovelling itself seemed romantic but neither egbert nor she yet

sense enough to see that ideas exist and eugenics itself in large quantities or small coming quickly or coming slowly urged from good motives or bad applied to a thousand people or applied to three eugenics itself is a thing no more to be bargained about than poisoning it is not really difficult to sum up the essence of eugenics though some of the eugenists seem to be rather vague about it the movement consists of two parts a moral basis which is common to all and a scheme of social application which varies a good deal for the moral basis it is obvious that man s ethical responsibility varies with his knowledge of consequences if i were in charge of a baby like dr johnson in that tower of vision and if the baby was ill through having eaten the soap i might possibly send for a doctor i might be calling him away from much more serious cases from the bedsides of babies whose diet had been far more deadly but i should be justified i could not be expected to know enough about his other patients to be obliged or even entitled to sacrifice to them the baby for whom i was primarily and directly responsible now the eugenic moral basis is this that the baby for whom we are primarily and directly responsible is the babe unborn that is that we know or may come to know enough of certain inevitable tendencies in biology to consider the fruit of some contemplated union in that direct and clear light of conscience which we can now only fix on the other partner in that union the one duty can conceivably be as definite as or more definite than the other the baby that does not exist can be considered even before the wife who does now it is essential to grasp that this is a comparatively new note in morality of course sane people always thought the aim of marriage was the procreation of children to the glory of god or according to the plan of nature but whether they counted such children as god s reward for service or nature s premium on sanity they always left the reward to god or the premium to nature as a less definable thing the only person and this is the point towards whom one could have precise duties was the partner in the process directly considering the partner s claims was the nearest one could get to indirectly considering the claims of posterity if the women of the harem sang praises of the hero as the moslem mounted his horse it was because this was the due of a man if the christian knight helped his wife off her horse it was because this was the due of a woman definite and detailed dues of this kind they did not predicate of the babe unborn regarding him in that agnostic and opportunist light in which mr browdie regarded the hypothetical child of miss squeers thinking these sex relations healthy they naturally hoped they would produce healthy children but that was all the moslem woman doubtless expected allah to send beautiful sons to an obedient wife but she would not have allowed any direct vision of such sons to alter the obedience itself she would not have said i will now be a disobedient wife as the learned leech informs me that great prophets are often the children of disobedient wives the knight doubtless hoped that the saints would help him to strong children if he did all the duties of his station one of which might be helping his wife off her horse but he would not have refrained from doing this because he had read in a book that a course of falling off horses often resulted in the birth of a genius both moslem and christian would have thought such speculations not only impious but utterly unpractical i quite agree with them but that is not the point here the point here is that a new school believes eugenics against ethics and it is proved by one familiar fact that the heroisms of history are actually the crimes of eugenics the eugenists books and articles are full of suggestions that non eugenic unions should and may come to be regarded as we regard sins that we should really feel that marrying an invalid is a kind of cruelty to children but history is full of the praises of people who have held sacred such ties to invalids of cases like those of colonel hutchinson and sir william temple who remained faithful to betrothals when beauty and health had been apparently blasted and though the illnesses of dorothy osborne and mrs hutchinson may not fall under the eugenic speculations i do not know it is obvious that they might have done so and certainly it would not have made any difference to men s moral opinion of the act i do not discuss here which morality i favour but i insist that they are opposite the eugenist really sets up as saints the very men whom hundreds of families have called sneaks to be consistent they ought to put up statues to the men who deserted their loves because of bodily misfortune with inscriptions celebrating the good eugenist who on his fianc e falling off a bicycle nobly refused to marry her or to the young hero who on hearing of an uncle with erysipelas magnanimously broke his word what is perfectly plain is this that mankind have hitherto held the bond between man and woman so sacred and the effect of it on the children so incalculable that they have always admired the maintenance of honour more than the maintenance of safety doubtless they thought that even the children might be none the worse for not being the children of cowards and shirkers but this was not the first thought the first commandment briefly we may say that while many moral systems have set restraints on sex almost as severe as any eugenist could set they have almost always had the character of securing the fidelity of the two sexes to each other and leaving the rest to god to introduce an ethic which makes that fidelity or infidelity vary with some calculation about heredity is that rarest of all t

with disgust with rage with melancholy and even with self contempt but even at the worst i had an uneasy consciousness that i would have to go back to them an outcast of the islands belongs to those novels of mine that were never laid aside and though it brought me the qualification of exotic writer i don t think the charge was at all justified for the life of me i don t see that there is the slightest exotic spirit in the conception or style of that novel it is certainly the most tropical of my eastern tales the mere scenery got a great hold on me as i went on perhaps because i may just as well confess that the story itself was never very near my heart it engaged my imagination much more than my affection as to my feeling for willems it was but the regard one cannot help having for one s own creation obviously i could not be indifferent to a man on whose head i had brought so much evil simply by imagining him such as he appears in the novel and that too on a very slight foundation the man who suggested willems to me was not particularly interesting in himself my interest was aroused by his dependent position his strange dubious status of a mistrusted disliked worn out european living on the reluctant toleration of that settlement hidden in the heart of the forest land up that sombre stream which our ship was the only white men s ship to visit with his hollow clean shaved cheeks a heavy grey moustache and eyes without any expression whatever clad always in a spotless sleeping suit much befrogged in front which left his lean neck wholly uncovered and with his bare feet in a pair of straw slippers he wandered silently amongst the houses in daylight almost as dumb as an animal and apparently much more homeless i don t know what he did with himself at night he must have had a place a hut a palm leaf shed some sort of hovel where he kept his razor and his change of sleeping suits an air of futile mystery hung over him something not exactly dark but obviously ugly the only definite statement i could extract from anybody was that it was he who had brought the arabs into the river that must have happened many years before but how did he bring them into the river he could hardly have done it in his arms like a lot of kittens i knew that almayer founded the chronology of all his misfortunes on the date of that fateful advent and yet the very first time we dined with almayer there was willems sitting at table with us in the manner of the skeleton at the feast obviously shunned by everybody never addressed by any one and for all recognition of his existence getting now and then from almayer a venomous glance which i observed with great surprise in the course of the whole evening he ventured one single remark which i didn t catch because his articulation was imperfect as of a man who had forgotten how to speak i was the only person who seemed aware of the sound willems subsided presently he retired pointedly unnoticed into the forest maybe its immensity was there within three hundred yards of the verandah ready to swallow up anything almayer conversing with my captain did not stop talking while he glared angrily at the retreating back didn t that fellow bring the arabs into the river nevertheless willems turned up next morning on almayer s verandah from the bridge of the steamer i could see plainly these two breakfasting together t te xa t te and i suppose in dead silence one with his air of being no longer interested in this world and the other raising his eyes now and then with intense dislike it was clear that in those days willems lived on almayer s charity yet on returning two months later to sambir i heard that he had gone on an expedition up the river in charge of a steam launch belonging to the arabs to make some discovery or other on account of the strange reluctance that everyone manifested to talk about willems it was impossible for me to get at the rights of that transaction moreover i was a newcomer the youngest of the company and i suspect not judged quite fit as yet for a full confidence i was not much concerned about that exclusion the faint suggestion of plots and mysteries pertaining to all matters touching almayer s affairs amused me vastly almayer was obviously very much affected i believe he missed willems immensely he wore an air of sinister preoccupation and talked confidentially with my captain i could catch only snatches of mumbled sentences then one morning as i came along the deck to take my place at the breakfast table almayer checked himself in his low toned discourse my captain s face was perfectly impenetrable there was a moment of profound silence and then as if unable to contain himself almayer burst out in a loud vicious tone one thing s certain if he finds anything worth having up there they will poison him like a dog disconnected though it was that phrase as food for thought was distinctly worth hearing we left the river three days afterwards and i never returned to sambir but whatever happened to the protagonist of my willems nobody can deny that i have recorded for him a less squalid fate j c nigger of the narcissus to my readers in america from that evening when james wait joined the ship late for the muster of the crew to the moment when he left us in the open sea shrouded in sailcloth through the open port i had much to do with him he was in my watch a negro in a british forecastle is a lonely being he has no chums yet james wait afraid of death and making her his accomplice was an impostor of some character

the very sky seemed to turn over like a wheel and it lay a ruin amid the tall grasses below a line of gray smoke going up slowly from it into the silent air a little lower the figure of a man with gray hair lay tumbled down the steep green slope his limbs lying all at random and his face turned away the eccentric fisherman dropped his net and walked swiftly toward the spot his new acquaintance following him as they drew near there seemed a sort of monstrous irony in the fact that the dead machine was still throbbing and thundering as busily as a factory while the man lay so still he was unquestionably dead the blood flowed in the grass from a hopelessly fatal fracture at the back of the skull but the face which was turned to the sun was uninjured and strangely arresting in itself it was one of those cases of a strange face so unmistakable as to feel familiar we feel somehow that we ought to recognize it even though we do not it was of the broad square sort with great jaws almost like that of a highly intellectual ape the wide mouth shut so tight as to be traced by a mere line the nose short with the sort of nostrils that seem to gape with an appetite for the air the oddest thing about the face was that one of the eyebrows was cocked up at a much sharper angle than the other march thought he had never seen a face so naturally alive as that dead one and its ugly energy seemed all the stranger for its halo of hoary hair some papers lay half fallen out of the pocket and from among them march extracted a card case he read the name on the card aloud sir humphrey turnbull i m sure i ve heard that name somewhere his companion only gave a sort of a little sigh and was silent for a moment as if ruminating then he merely said the poor fellow is quite gone and added some scientific terms in which his auditor once more found himself out of his depth as things are continued the same curiously well informed person it will be more legal for us to leave the body

greatest thing in english history if it fails it will be the most heroic failure in english history are you an admirer of your great kinsman mr fisher rather said mr fisher he s the best shot i know then as if sincerely repentant of his nonchalance he added with a sort of enthusiasm no but really he s a beautiful shot as if fired by his own words he took a sort of leap at the ledges of the rock above him and scaled them with a sudden agility in startling contrast to his general lassitude he had stood for some seconds on the headland above with his aquiline profile under the panama hat relieved against the sky and peering over the countryside before his companion had collected himself sufficiently to scramble up after him the level above was a stretch of common turf on which the tracks of the fated car were plowed plainly enough but the brink of it was broken as with rocky teeth broken boulders of all shapes and sizes lay near the edge it was almost incredible that any one could have deliberately driven into such a death trap especially in broad daylight i can t make head or tail of it said march was he blind or blind drunk neither by the look of him replied the other then it was suicide it doesn t seem a cozy way of doing it remarked the man called fisher besides i don t fancy poor old puggy would commit suicide somehow poor old who inquired the wondering journalist did you know this unfortunate man nobody knew him exactly replied fisher with some vagueness but one knew him of course he d been a terror in his time in parliament and the courts and so on

other admired object with them would be all very well but he wouldn t be enough therefore what should one say to some other young man who would chuck something and somebody else admired in their way

interesting one indispensably with the passions of the theatre as a profession or at least as an absorption i should have to place the theatre in another light than the satiric this however would by good luck be perfectly possible too without a sacrifice of truth and i should doubtless even be able to make my theatric case as important as i might desire it it seemed clear that i needed big cases small ones would practically give my central idea away and i make out now my still labouring under the illusion that the case of the sacrifice for art can ever be with truth with taste with discretion

those characters are all large and expansive seated and established and endowed whereas the most charming truth about the preference for art is that to parade abroad so thoroughly inward and so naturally embarrassed a matter is to falsify and vulgarise it that as a preference attended with the honours of publicity it is indeed nowhere that in fact under the rule of its sincerity its only honours are those of contradiction concentration and a seemingly deplorable indifference to everything but itself nothing can well figure as less big in an honest thesis than a marked instance of somebody s willingness to pass mainly for an ass of these things i must i say have been in strictness aware what i perhaps failed of was to note that if a certain romantic glamour even that of mere eccentricity or of a fine perversity may be flung over the act of exchange of a career for the esthetic life in general the prose and the modesty of the matter yet come in with any exhibition of the particular branch of esthetics selected then it is that the attitude of hero or heroine may look too much for the romantic effect like a low crouching over proved trifles art indeed has in our day taken on so many honours and emoluments that the recognition of its importance is more than a custom has become on occasion almost a fury the line is drawn especially in the english world only at the importance of heeding what it may mean the more i turn my pieces over at any rate the more i now see i must have found in them and i remember how once well in presence of my three typical examples my fear of too ample a canvas quite dropped the only question was that if i had marked my political case from so far back for a story by itself and then marked my theatrical case for another the joining together of these interests originally seen as separate might all disgracefully betray the seam show for mechanical and superficial a story was a story a picture a picture and i had a mortal horror of two stories two pictures in one the reason of this was the clearest my subject was immediately under that disadvantage so cheated of its indispensable centre as to become of no more use for expressing a main intention than a wheel without a hub is of use for moving a cart it was a fact apparently that one had on occasion seen two pictures in one were there not for instance certain sublime tintorettos at venice a measureless crucifixion in especial which showed without loss of authority half a dozen actions separately taking place yes that might be but there had surely been nevertheless a mighty pictorial fusion so that the virtue of composition had somehow thereby come all mysteriously to its own of course the affair would be simple enough if composition could be kept out of the question yet by what art or process what bars and bolts what unmuzzled dogs and pointed guns perform that feat i had to know myself utterly inapt for any such valour and recognise that to make it possible sundry things should have begun for me much further back than i had felt them even in their dawn a picture without composition slights its most precious chance for beauty and is moreover not composed at all unless the painter knows how that principle of health and safety working as an absolutely premeditated art has prevailed there may in its absence be life incontestably as the newcomes has life as les trois mousquetaires as tolstoi s peace and war have it but what do such large loose baggy monsters with their queer elements of the accidental and the arbitrary artistically mean we have heard it maintained we well remember that such things are superior to art but we understand least of all what that may mean and we look in vain for the artist the divine explanatory genius who will come to our aid and tell us there is life and life and as waste is only life sacrificed and thereby prevented from counting i delight in a deep breathing economy and an orga

that he had not improved in the slightest degree since their last meeting and sam who imagined that he had long since grown to man s estate and put off childish things was embarrassed to discover that his aunt still affected him as of old that is to say she made him feel as if he had omitted to shave and in addition to that had swallowed some drug which had caused him to swell unpleasantly particularly about the hands and feet jolly morning said sam perseveringly so i imagine i have not yet been out thought i d look in and see how you were that was very kind of you the morning is my busy time but yes that was very kind of you there was another pause how do you like america said sam i dislike it exceedingly yes well of course some people do prohibition and all that personally it doesn t affect me i can take it or leave it alone the reason i dislike america began mrs hignett bridling i like it myself said sam i ve had a wonderful time everybody s treated me like a rich uncle i ve been in detroit you know and they practically gave me the city and asked me if i d like another to take home in my pocket never saw anything like it i might have been the missing heir i think america s the greatest invention on record and what brought you to america said mrs hignett unmoved by this rhapsody oh i came over to play golf in a tournament you know surely at your age said mrs hignett disapprovingly you could be better occupied do you spend your whole time playing golf oh no i hunt a bit and shoot a bit and i swim a good lot and i still play football occasionally i wonder your father does not insist on your doing some useful work he is beginning to harp on the subject rather i suppose i shall take a stab at it sooner or later father says i ought to get married too he is perfectly right i suppose old eustace will be getting hitched up one of these days said sam mrs hignett started violently why do you say that eh what makes you say that oh well he s a romantic sort of fellow writes poetry and all that there is no likelihood at all of eustace marrying he is of a shy and retiring temperament and sees few women he is almost a recluse sam was aware of this and had frequently regretted it he had always been fond of his cousin and in that half amused and rather patronising way in which men of thews and sinews are fond of the weaker brethren who run more to pallor and intellect and he had always felt that if eustace had not had to retire to windles to spend his life with a woman whom from his earliest years he had always considered the empress of the wash outs much might have been made of him both at school and at oxford eustace had been if not a sport at least a decidedly cheery old bean sam remembered eustace at school breaking gas globes with a slipper in a positively rollicking manner he remembered him at oxford playing up to him manfully at the piano on the occasion when he had done that imitation of frank tinney which had been such a hit at the trinity smoker yes eustace had had the makings of a pretty sound egg and it was too bad that he had allowed his mother to coop him up down in the country miles away from anywhere eustace is returning to england on saturday said mrs hignett she spoke a little wistfully she had not been parted from her son since he had come down from oxford and she would have liked to keep him with her till the end of her lecturing tour that however was out of the question it was imperative that while she was away he should be at windles nothing would have induced her to leave the place at the mercy of servants who might trample over the flower beds scratch the polished floors and forget to cover up the canary at night he sails on the atlantic that s splendid said sam i m sailing on the atlantic myself i ll go down to the office and see if we can t have a state room together but where is he going to live when he gets to england where is he going to live why at windles of course where else but i thought you were letting windles for the summer mrs hignett stared letting windles she spoke as one might address a lunatic what put that extraordinary idea into your head i thought father said something about your letting the place to some american nothing of the kind it seemed to sam that his aunt spoke somewhat vehemently even snappishly in correcting what was a perfectly natural mistake he could not know that the subject of letting windles for the summer was one which had long since begun to infuriate mrs hignett people had certainly asked her to let windles in fact people had pestered her there was a rich fat man an american named bennett whom she had met just before sailing at her brother s house in london invited down to windles for the day mr bennett had fallen in love with the place and had begged her to name her own price not content with this he had pursued her with his pleadings by means of the wireless telegraph while she was on the ocean and had not given up the struggle even when she reached new york he had egged on a friend of his a mr mortimer to continue the persecution in that city and this very morning among the letters on mrs hignett s table the buff envelope of a cable from mr bennett had peeped out nearly spoiling her breakfast no wonder then that sam s allusion to the affair had caused the authoress of the spreading light momentarily to lose her customary calm nothing will induce me ever to let windles she said with finality and rose significantly sam perceiving that the audience was at an end and glad of it also got up well i think i ll be going down and seeing about that state room

that looked like a birdsnest and he said x x co father please to take me down i want to look at that birdsnest x x d his father knew that he would not hurt the birdsnest so he took him off of the horse and put him on the ground then he walked on with the horse and rollo turned back to see the nest he climbed up upon a log that lay by the side of the bush and then gently opened the branches and looked in four little unfledged birds lifted up their heads and opened their mouths wide they heard the noise which rollo made and thought it was their mother come to feed them x x cah you little

slowly and carefully out of the yard rollo ran along behind the wagon as far as the gate to see his father go off and stood there a few minutes watching him as he rode along until he disappeared at a turn in the road he then came back to the yard and sat down on a log by the side of jonas who was busily at work mending the wheelbarrow rollo sat singing to himself for some time and then he said x x

said jonas x x cwhat have you been doing x x d rollo had no answer at hand for he had not been doing any thing at all the truth was it was pleasanter for him to sit on the log and sing and see jonas mend the wheelbarrow than to go to work himself and he mistook that feeling for being tired boys often do so when they are set to work rollo finding that he had no excuse for sitting there any longer presently got up and sauntered along towards the house saying that he was going to work picking up chips now there was in a certain corner of the yard a considerable space covered with chips which were the ones that rollo had to pick up he knew that his father wished to have them put into a kind of a bin in the shed called the chip bin so he went into the house for a basket he found his mother busy and she said she could not go and get a basket for him but she told him the chip basket was probably in its place in the shed and he might go and get that x x cbut x x d said rollo x x cthat is too large i cannot lift that great basket full of chips x x d x x cyou need not fill it full then x x d said his mother x x cput in just as many as you can easily carry x x d rollo still objected

the morning room that was all among the accumulations of ten generations the living had left but few traces lying on the table in the morning room he saw his own book of poems what tact he picked it up and opened it it was what the reviewers call a slim volume he read at hazard but silence and the topless dark vault in the lights of luna park and blackpool from the nightly gloom hollows a bright tumultuous tomb he put it down again shook his head and sighed what genius i had then he reflected echoing the aged swift it was nearly six months since the book had been published he was glad to think he would never write anything of the same sort again who could have been reading it he wondered anne perhaps he liked to think so perhaps too she had at last recognised herself in the hamadryad of the poplar sapling the slim hamadryad whose movements were like the swaying of a young tree in the wind the woman who was a tree was what he had called the poem he had given her the book when it came out hoping that the poem would tell her what he hadn t dared to say she had never referred to it he shut his eyes and saw a vision of her in a red velvet cloak swaying into the little restaurant where they sometimes dined together in london three quarters of an hour late and he at his table haggard with anxiety irritation hunger oh she was damnable it occurred to him that perhaps his hostess might be in her boudoir it was a possibility he would go and see mrs wimbush s boudoir was in the central tower on the garden front a little staircase cork screwed up to it from the hall denis mounted

elaborate coiffure of a curiously improbable shade of orange looking at her denis always thought of wilkie bard as the cantatrice that s why i m going to sing in op ra sing in op ra sing in op pop pop

ready in his mind it would be a pleasure to give it utterance to begin with he said but he was too late mrs wimbush s question had been what the grammarians call rhetorical it asked for no answer it was a little conversational flourish a gambit in the polite game you find me busy at my horoscopes she said without even being aware that she had interrupted him a little pained denis decided to reserve his story for more receptive ears he contented himself by way of revenge with saying oh rather icily did i tell you how i won four hundred on the grand national this year yes he replied still frigid and mono syllabic she must have told him at least six times wonderful isn t it everything is in the stars in the old days before i had the stars to help me i used to lose thousands now she paused an instant well look at that four hundred on the grand national that s the stars denis would have liked to hear more about the old days but he was too discreet and still more too shy to ask

the morning room that was all among the accumulations of ten generations the living had left but few traces lying on the table in the morning room he saw his own book of poems what tact he picked it up and opened it it was what the reviewers call a slim volume he read at hazard but silence and the topless dark vault in the lights of luna park and blackpool from the nightly gloom hollows a bright tumultuous tomb he put it down again shook his head and sighed what genius i had then he reflected echoing the aged swift it was nearly six months since the book had been published he was glad to think he would never write anything of the same sort again who could have been reading it he wondered anne perhaps he liked to think so perhaps too she had at last recognised herself in the hamadryad of the poplar sapling the slim hamadryad whose movements were like the swaying of a young tree in the wind the woman who was a tree was what he had called the poem he had given her the book when it came out hoping that the poem would tell her what he hadn t dared to say she had never referred to it he shut his eyes and saw a vision of her in a red velvet cloak swaying into the little restaurant where they sometimes dined together in london three quarters of an hour late and he at his table haggard with anxiety irritation hunger oh she was damnable it occurred to him that perhaps his hostess might be in her boudoir it was a possibility he would go and see mrs wimbush s boudoir was in the central tower on the garden front a little staircase cork screwed up to it from the hall denis mounted

ready in his mind it would be a pleasure to give it utterance to begin with he said but he was too late mrs wimbush s question had been what the grammarians call rhetorical it asked for no answer it was a little conversational flourish a gambit in the polite game you find me busy at my horoscopes she said without even being aware that she had interrupted him a little pained denis decided to reserve his story for more receptive ears he contented himself by way of revenge with saying oh rather icily did i tell you how i won four hundred on the grand national this year yes he replied still frigid and mono syllabic she must have told him at least six times wonderful isn t it everything is in the stars in the old days before i had the stars to help me i used to lose thousands now she

in the cathedral of worcester during the years he had served as master of fence at the english court the sons of royalty had learned to thrust and parry and cut as only de vac could teach the art and he had been as conscientious in the discharge of his duties as he had been in his unswerving hatred and contempt for his pupils and now the english king had put upon him such an insult as might only be wiped out by blood as the blow fell the wiry frenchman clicked his heels together and throwing down his foil he stood erect and rigid as a marble statue before his master white and livid was his tense drawn face but he spoke no word he might have struck the king but then there would have been left to him no alternative save death by his own hand for a king may not fight with a lesser mortal and he who strikes a king may not live the king s honor must be satisfied had a french king struck him de vac would have struck back and gloried in the fate which permitted him to die for the honor of france but an english king pooh a dog and who would die for a dog no de vac would find other means of satisfying his wounded pride he would revel in revenge against this man for whom he felt no loyalty if possible he would harm the whole of england if he could but he would bide his time he could afford to wait for his opportunity if by waiting he could encompass a more terrible revenge de

claim the title of his sire how he had left france and entered the service of john of england is not of this story all the bearing that the life of jules de vac has upon the history of england hinges upon but two of his many attributes his wonderful swordsmanship and his fearful hatred for his adopted country chapter ii south of the armory of westminster palace lay the gardens and here on the third day following the king s affront to de vac might have been a seen a black haired woman gowned in a violet cyclas richly embroidered with gold about the yoke and at the bottom of the loose pointed sleeves which reached almost to the similar bordering on the lower hem of the garment a richly wrought leathern girdle studded with precious stones and held in place by a huge carved buckle of gold clasped the garment about her waist so that the upper portion fell outward over the girdle after the manner of a blouse in the girdle was a long dagger of beautiful workmanship dainty sandals encased her feet while a wimple of violet silk bordered in gold fringe lay becomingly over her head and shoulders by her side walked a handsome boy of about three clad like his companion in gay colors his tiny surcoat of scarlet velvet was rich with embroidery while beneath was a close fitting tunic of white silk his doublet was of scarlet while his long hose of white were cross gartered with scarlet from his tiny sandals to his knees on the back of his brown curls sat a flat brimmed round crowned hat in which a single plume of white waved and nodded bravely at each move of the proud little head the child s features were well molded and his frank bright eyes gave an expression of boyish generosity to a face which otherwise would have been too arrogant and haughty for such a mere baby as he talked with his companion little flashes of peremptory authority and dignity which sat strangely upon one so tiny caused the young woman at times to turn her head from him that he might not see the smiles which she could scarce repress presently the boy took a ball from his tunic and pointing at a little bush near them said stand you there lady maud by yonder bush i would play at toss the young woman did as she was bid and when she had taken her place and turned to face him the boy threw the ball to her thus they played beneath the windows of the armory the boy running blithely after the ball when he missed it and laughing and shouting in happy glee when he made a particularly good catch in one of the windows of the armory overlooking the garden stood a grim gray old man leaning upon his folded arms his brows drawn together in a malignant scowl the corners of his mouth set in a stern cold line he looked upon the garden and the playing child and upon the lovely young woman beneath him but with eyes which did not see for de vac was working out a great problem the greatest of all his life for three days the old man had brooded over his grievance seeking for some means to be revenged upon the king for the insult which henry had put upon him many schemes had presented themselves to his shrewd and cunning mind but so far all had been rejected as unworthy of the terrible satisfaction which his wounded pride demanded his fancies had for the most part revolved about the unsettled political conditions of henry s reign for from these he felt he might wrest that opportunity which could be turned to his own personal uses and to the harm and possibly the undoing of the king for years an inmate of the palace and often a listener in the armory when the king played at sword with his friends and favorites de vac had heard much which passed between henry iii and his intimates that could well be turned to the king s harm by a shrewd and resourceful enemy with all england he knew the utter contempt in which henry held the terms of the magna charta which he so often violated along with his kingly oath to maintain it but what all england did not know de

reverse direction by reducing the principles of mechanics to those of electricity and this especially as confidence in the strict validity of the equations of newton s mechanics was shaken by the experiments with beta rays and rapid kathode rays this dualism still confronts us in unextenuated form in the theory of hertz where matter appears not only as the bearer of velocities kinetic energy and mechanical pressures but also as the bearer of electromagnetic fields since such fields also occur in vacuo i e in free ether the ether also appears as bearer of electromagnetic fields the ether appears indistinguishable in its functions from ordinary matter within matter it takes part in the motion of matter and in empty space it has everywhere a velocity so that the ether has a definitely assigned velocity throughout the whole of space there is no fundamental difference between hertz s ether and ponderable matter which in part subsists in the ether the hertz theory suffered not only from the defect of ascribing to matter and ether on the one hand mechanical states and on the other hand electrical states which do not stand in any conceivable relation to each other it was also at variance with the result of fizeau s important experiment on the velocity of the propagation of light in moving fluids and with other established experimental results such was the state of things when h a lorentz entered upon the scene he brought theory into harmony with experience by means of a wonderful simplification of theoretical principles he achieved this the most important advance in the theory of electricity since maxwell by taking from ether its mechanical and from matter its electromagnetic qualities as in empty space so too in the interior of material bodies the ether and not matter viewed atomistically was exclusively the seat of electromagnetic fields according to lorentz the elementary particles of matter alone are capable of carrying out movements their electromagnetic activity is entirely confined to the carrying of electric charges thus lorentz succeeded in reducing all electromagnetic happenings to maxwell s equations for free space as to the mechanical nature of the lorentzian ether it may be said of it in a somewhat playful spirit that immobility is the only mechanical property of which it has not been deprived by h a lorentz it may be added that the whole change in the conception of the ether which the special theory of relativity brought about consisted in taking away from the ether its last mechanical quality namely its immobility how this is to be understood will forthwith be expounded the space time theory and the kinematics of the special theory of relativity were modelled on the maxwell lorentz theory of the electromagnetic field this theory therefore satisfies the conditions of the special theory of relativity but when viewed from the latter it acquires a novel aspect for if k be a system of co ordinates relatively to which the lorentzian ether is at rest the maxwell lorentz equations are valid primarily with reference to k but by the special theory of relativity the same equations without any change of meaning also hold in relation to any new system of co ordinates k which is moving in uniform translation relatively to k now comes the anxious question why must i in the theory distinguish the k system above all k systems which are physically equivalent to it in all respects by assuming that the ether is at rest relatively to the k system for the theoretician such an asymmetry in the theoretical structure with no corresponding asymmetry in the system of experience is intolerable if we assume the ether to be at rest relatively to k but in motion relatively to k the physical equivalence of k and k seems to me from the logical standpoint not indeed downright incorrect but nevertheless inacceptable the next position which it was possible to take up in face of this state of things appeared to be the following the ether does not exist at all the electromagnetic fields are not states of a medium and are not bound down to any bearer but they are independent realities which are not reducible to anything else exactly like the atoms of ponderable matter this conception suggests itself the more readily as according to lorentz s theory electromagnetic radiation like ponderable matter brings impulse and energy with it and as according to the special theory of relativity both matter and radiation are but special forms of distributed energy ponderable mass losing its isolation and appearing as a special form of energy more careful reflection teaches us however that the special theory of relativity does not compel us to deny ether we may assume the existence of an ether only we must give up ascribing a definite state of motion to it i e we must by abstraction take from it the last mechanical characteristic which lorentz had still left it we shall see later that this point of view the conceivability of which i shall at once endeavour to make more intelligible by a somewhat halting comparison is justified by the results of the general theory of relativity think of waves on the surface of water here we can describe two entirely different things either we may observe how the undulatory surface forming the boundary between water and air alters in the course of time or else with the help of small floats for instance we can observe how the position of the separate particles of water alters in the course of time if the existence of such floats for tracking the motion of the particles of a fluid were a fundamental impossibility in physics if in fact nothing else whatever were observable than the shape of the space occupied by the water as it varies in time we should have no ground for

elephant of the king with its trappings of gold is led to the entrance where at a word it sinks obediently to the ground the king appears he has changed his gay apple green dress to one of more sombre hue he enters the howdah the elephant rises the procession starts it consists of not fewer than two hundred persons keeping in view of the audience until lost by a bend in the avenue scene ii the pagoda of golden flowers midnight surrounded by peepul trees the great htee with its crown of a myriad jewels rises towards the violet star studded sky its golden bells tinkling in a soft night wind when the curtain rises the circular platform is deserted statues of buddha seated and recumbent fill the numberless niches in the wall and before each burn long candles heaped up pink roses and japonica on brass trays are lit from above by swinging coloured lamps at intervals are stalls laden with fruit and cheroots all is mysterious solemn beautiful a deep burmese gong tolls people emerge from the four staircases that lead up to the platform men women and children all in gala attire the young people conversing gesticulating smiling the older people more subdued carry beads and votive offering to buddha charming burmese girls with huge cigars meet and greet handsome burmese men smoking cheroots and wearing flowers in their ears children play silently with coloured balls in the corners under canopies are seated fortune tellers busy casting horoscopes it is a veritable riot of colour with never a discordant note through the crowd the king passes alone and unrecognised and disappears through double doors of heavily carved teak wood he has hardly passed when mah phru a very lovely girl enters in distress she whispers that she desires an audience of the king who has come amongst them the few who hear her shrug their shoulders smile and pass on they are incredulous she goes from group to group but the people turn from her with disdain then the great doors open and the king is seen the girl throws herself oriental fashion in his path her beauty and her pathos arrest his attention and he waves aside those who would interfere she implores the king s protection she is willing to be his slave he listens with deep attention she explains that since her father s death she has been continuously persecuted by the village people on the double count of her italian blood and her poverty the girl invites him to come to her hut in the forest and verify what she says with a gesture he signifies that he will follow where she leads she rises the crowd gathers round all are hushed to silence the king as one entranced puts aside all who would in any way interfere the girl precedes him going from the pagoda towards the night when she reaches the great staircase she beckons oriental fashion with downward hand the scene should in grouping and colour make for rare beauty scene iii a humble dhunni thatched hut set amidst the whispering grandeur of the jungle with its mighty trees its trackless paths its indescribable silence the curtain discovers mah phru and the king who expresses his amazement at the loneliness and the poverty of her lot she explains that poverty is not what frightens her but the enmity of those who live yonder and who make it almost impossible for her to sell her cucumbers or her pineapples the king s gaze never leaves the face or figure of the girl he declares that he will protect her that he will build her a home here in the shadow of the loneliness around them he has two years of an unfettered freedom for those years he can command his life he loves her he desires her they will find a paradise together the girl trembles with joy with fear with surprise and after two years she asks death he answers act ii scene i the jungle once more

doctor all sorts of people lie awake thinking of it i wish some of my damned committee would the doctor turned his eyes to the window i lie awake too he said and seemed to reflect but he was observing his patient acutely with his ears but you see how important it is said sir richmond and left his sentence unfinished i ll do what i can for you said the doctor and considered swiftly what line of talk he had best follow section this sense of a coming smash is epidemic said the doctor it s at the back of all sorts of mental trouble it is a new state of mind before the war it was abnormal a phase of neurasthenia now it is almost the normal state with whole classes of intelligent people intelligent i say the others always have been casual and adventurous and always will be a loss of confidence in the general background of life so that we seem to float over abysses we do said sir richmond and we have nothing but the old habits and ideas acquired in the days of our assurance there is a discord a jarring the doctor pursued his train of thought a new raw and dreadful sense of responsibility for the universe accompanied by a realization that the job is overwhelmingly too big for us we ve got to stand up to the job said sir richmond anyhow what else is there to do we may keep things together i ve got to do my bit and if only i could hold myself at it i could beat those fellows but that s where the devil of it comes in never have i been so desirous to work well in my life and never have i been so slack and weak willed and inaccurate sloppy indolent vicious the doctor was about to speak but sir richmond interrupted him what s got hold of me what s got hold of me i used to work well enough it s as if my will had come untwisted and was ravelling out into separate strands i ve lost my unity i m not a man but a mob i ve got to recover my vigour at any cost again as the doctor was about to speak the word was taken out of his mouth and what i think of it dr martineau is this it s fatigue it s mental and moral fatigue too much effort on too high a level and too austere one strains and fags flags flags i meant to say one strains and flags and then the lower stuff in one the subconscious stuff takes control there was a flavour of popularized psychoanalysis about this and the doctor drew in the corners of his mouth and gave his head a critical slant m m but this only made sir richmond raise his voice and quicken his speech i want he said a good tonic a pick me up a stimulating harmless drug of some sort that s indicated anyhow to begin with something to pull me together as people say bring me up to the scratch again i don t like the use of drugs said the doctor the expectation of sir richmond s expression changed to disappointment but that s not reasonable he cried that s not reasonable that s superstition call a thing a drug and condemn it everything is a drug everything that affects you food stimulates or tranquillizes drink noise is a stimulant and quiet an opiate what is life but response to stimulants or reaction after them when i m exhausted i want food when i m overactive and sleepless i want tranquillizing when i m dispersed i want pulling together but we don t know how to use drugs the doctor objected but you ought to know dr martineau fixed his eye on a first floor window sill on the opposite side of harley street his manner suggested a lecturer holding on to his theme a day will come when we shall be able to manipulate drugs all sorts of drugs and work them in to our general way of living i have no prejudice against them at all a time will come when we shall correct our moods get down to our reserves of energy by their help suspend fatigue put off sleep during long spells of exertion at some sudden crisis for example when we shall know enough to know just how far to go with this that or the other stuff and how to wash out its after effects i quite agree with you in principle but that time hasn t come yet decades of research yet if we tried that sort of thing now we should be like children playing with poisons and explosives it s out of the question i ve been taking a few little things already easton syrup for example strychnine it carries you for a time and drops you by the way has it done you any good any nett good it has i can see broken your sleep the doctor turned round again to his patient and looked up into his troubled face given physiological trouble i don t mind resorting to a drug given structural injury i don t mind surgery but except for any little mischief your amateur drugging may have done you do not seem to me to be either sick or injured you ve no trouble either of structure or material you are worried ill in your mind and otherwise perfectly sound it s the current of your

grew intenser focused itself as it were in a narrower snout mr hutton made a cinquecento gesture and kissed her extended hand it was the first time he had done such a thing the action seemed not to be resented i look forward to to morrow do you for answer mr hutton once more kissed her hand then turned to go miss spence accompanied him to the porch where s your car she asked i left it at the gate of the drive i ll come and see you off no no mr hutton was playful but determined you must do no such thing i simply forbid you but i should like to come miss spence protested throwing a rapid gioconda at him mr hutton held up his hand no he repeated and then with a gesture that was almost the blowing of a kiss he started to run down the drive lightly on his toes with long bounding strides like a boy s he was proud of that run it was quite marvellously youthful still he was glad the drive was no longer at the last bend before passing out of sight of the house he halted and turned round miss spence was still standing on the steps smiling her smile he waved his hand and this time quite definitely and overtly wafted a kiss in her direction then breaking once more into his magnificent canter he rounded the last dark promontory of trees once out of sight of the house he let his high paces decline to a trot and finally to a walk he took out his handkerchief and began wiping his neck inside his collar what fools what fools had there ever been such an ass as poor dear janet spence never unless it was himself decidedly he was the more malignant fool since he at least was aware of his folly and still persisted in it why did he persist ah the problem that was himself the problem that was other people he had reached the gate a large prosperous looking motor was standing at the side of the road home m nab the chauffeur touched his cap and stop at the cross roads on the way as usual mr hutton added as he opened the door of the car well he said speaking into the obscurity that lurked within oh teddy bear what an age you ve been it was a fresh and childish voice that spoke the words there was the faintest hint of cockney impurity about the vowel sounds mr hutton bent his large form and darted into the car with the agility of an animal regaining its burrow have i he said as he shut the door the machine began to move you must have missed me a lot if you found the time so long he sat back in the low seat a cherishing warmth enveloped him teddy bear and with a sigh of contentment a charming little head declined on to mr hutton s shoulder ravished he looked down sideways at the round babyish face do you know doris you look like the pictures of louise de kerouaille he passed his fingers through a mass of curly hair who s louise de kera whatever it is doris spoke from remote distances she was alas fuit we shall all be was one of these days meanwhile mr hutton covered the babyish face with kisses the car rushed smoothly along mcnab s back through the front window was stonily impassive the back of a statue your hands doris whispered oh you mustn t touch me they give me electric shocks mr hutton adored her for the virgin imbecility of the words how late in one s existence one makes the discovery of one s body the electricity isn t in me it s in you he kissed her again whispering her name several times doris doris doris the scientific appellation of the sea mouse he was thinking as he kissed the throat she offered him white and extended like the throat of a victim awaiting the sacrificial knife the sea mouse was a sausage with iridescent fur

crassus you will carry out the orders i will send out the messengers within an hour this very morning there has come news that the barbarians are through the old gap in the wall and their outriders as far south as vinovia the governor shrugged his shoulders these things concern us no longer said he then a bitter smile broke upon his aquiline clean shaven face whom think you that i see in audience this morning nay i know not caradoc and regnus and celticus the icenian who like so many of the richer britons have been educated at rome and who would lay before me their plans as to the ruling of this country and what is their plan that they themselves should do it the roman soldier laughed well they will have their will said he as he saluted and turned upon his heel farewell your excellency there are hard days coming for you and for me an hour later the british deputation was ushered into the presence of the governor they were good steadfast men men who with a whole heart and at some risk to themselves had taken up their country s cause so far as they could see it at the same time they well knew that under the mild and beneficent rule of rome it was only when they passed from words to deeds that their backs or their necks would be in danger they stood now earnest and a little abashed before the throne of the viceroy celticus was a swarthy black bearded little iberian caradoc and regnus were tall middle aged men of the fair flaxen british type all three were dressed in the draped yellow toga after the latin fashion instead of in the brac and tunic which distinguished their more insular fellow countrymen well asked the governor we are here said celticus boldly as the spokesmen of a great number of our fellow countrymen for the purpose of sending our petition through you to the emperor and to the roman senate that we may urge upon them the policy of allowing us to govern this country after our own ancient fashion he paused as if awaiting some outburst as an answer to his own temerity but the governor merely nodded his head as a sign that he should proceed we had laws of our own before ever c sar set foot in britain which have served their purpose since first our forefathers came from the land of ham we are not a child among the nations but our history goes back in our own traditions further even than that of rome and we are galled by this yoke which you have laid upon us are not our laws just asked the governor the code of c sar is just but it is always the code of c sar our own laws were made for our own uses and our own circumstances and we would fain have them again you speak roman as if you had been bred in the forum you wear a roman toga your hair is filleted in roman fashion are not these the gifts of rome we would take all the learning and all the arts that rome or greece could give but we would still be britain and ruled by britons the viceroy smiled by the rood of saint helena said he had you spoken thus to some of my heathen ancestors there would have been an end to your politics that you have dared to stand before my face and say as much is a proof for ever of the gentleness of our rule but i would reason with you for a moment upon this your request you know well that this land has never been one kingdom but was always under many chiefs and many tribes who have made war upon each other would you in very truth have it so again those were in the evil pagan days the days of the druid and the oak grove your excellency but now we are held together by a gospel of peace the viceroy shook his head if all the world were of the same way of thinking then it would be easier said he it may be that this blessed doctrine of peace will be little help to you when you are face to face with strong men who still worship the god of war what would you do against the picts of the north your excellency knows that many of the bravest legionaries are of british blood these are our defence but discipline man the power to command the knowledge of war the strength to act it is in these things that you would fail too long have you leaned upon the crutch the times may be hard but when we have gone through them britain will be herself again nay she will be under a different and a harsher master said the roman already the pirates swarm upon the eastern coast were it not for our roman count of the saxon shore they would land to morrow i see the day when britain may indeed be one but that will be because you and your fellows are either dead or are driven into the mountains of the west all goes into the melting pot and if a better albion should come forth from it it will be after ages of strife and neither you nor your people will have part or lot in it regnus the tall young celt smiled with the help of god and our own right arms we should hope for a better end said he give us but the chance and we will bear the brunt you are as men that are lost said the viceroy sadly i see this broad land with its gardens and orchards its fair villas and its walled towns its bridges and its roads all the work of rome surely it will pass even as a dream and these three hundred years of settled order will leave no trace behind for learn that it will indeed be as you wish and that this very day the orders have come to me that the legions are to go the three britons looked at each

have awkward consequences darwin was given an imposing reputation as not only an evolutionist but as the evolutionist with the immense majority who never read his books the few who never read any others were led by them to concentrate exclusively on circumstantial selection as the explanation of all the transformations and adaptations which were the evidence for evolution and they presently found themselves so cut off by this specialization from the majority who knew darwin only by his spurious reputation that they were obliged to distinguish themselves not as darwinians but as neo darwinians before ten more years had elapsed the neo darwinians were practically running current science it was i was fifty i published my own view of evolution in a play called man and superman and i found that most people were unable to understand how i could be an evolutionist and not a neo darwinian or why i habitually derided neo darwinism as a ghastly idiocy and would fall on its professors slaughterously in public discussions it was in the hope of making me clear the matter up that the fabian society which was then organizing a series of lectures on prophets of the nineteenth century asked me to deliver a lecture on the prophet darwin i did so and scraps of that lecture which was never published variegate these pages political inadequacy of the human animal ten more years elapsed neo darwinism in politics had produced a european catastrophe of a magnitude so appalling and a scope so unpredictable that as i write these lines in it is still far from certain whether our civilization will survive it the circumstances of this catastrophe the boyish cinema fed romanticism which made it possible to impose it on the people as a crusade and especially the ignorance and errors of the victors of western europe when its violent phase had passed and the time for reconstruction arrived confirmed a doubt which had grown steadily in my mind during my forty years public work as a socialist namely whether the human animal as he exists at present is capable of solving the social problems raised by his own aggregation or as he calls it his civilization cowardice of the irreligious another observation i had made was that goodnatured unambitious men are cowards when they have no religion they are dominated and exploited not only by greedy and often half witted and half alive weaklings who will do anything for cigars champagne motor cars and the more childish and selfish uses of money but by able and sound administrators who can do nothing else with them than dominate and exploit them government and exploitation become synonymous under such circumstances and the world is finally ruled by the childish the brigands and the blackguards those who refuse to stand in with them are persecuted and occasionally executed when they give any trouble to the exploiters they fall into poverty when they lack lucrative specific talents at the present moment one half of europe having knocked the other half down is trying to kick it to death and may succeed a procedure which is logically sound neo darwinism and the goodnatured majority are looking on in helpless horror or allowing themselves to be persuaded by the newspapers of their exploiters that the kicking is not only a sound commercial investment but an act of divine justice of which they are the ardent instruments but if man is really incapable of organizing a big civilization and cannot organize even a village or a tribe any too well what is the use of giving him a religion a religion may make him hunger and thirst for righteousness but will it endow him with the practical capacity to satisfy that appetite good intentions do not carry with them a grain of political science which is a very complicated one the most devoted and indefatigable the most able and disinterested students of this science in england as far as i know are my friends sidney and beatrice webb it has taken them forty years of preliminary work in the course of which they have published several treatises comparable to adam smith s wealth of nations to formulate a political constitution adequate to existing needs if this is the measure of what can be done in a lifetime by extraordinary ability keen natural aptitude exceptional opportunities and freedom from the preoccupations of bread winning what are we to expect from the parliament man to whom political science is as remote and distasteful as the differential calculus and to whom such an elementary but vital point as the law of economic rent is a pons asinorum never to be approached much less crossed or from the common voter who is mostly so hard at work all day earning a living that he cannot keep awake for five minutes over a book is there any hope in education the usual answer is that we must educate our masters that is ourselves we must teach citizenship and political science at school but must we there is no must about it the hard fact being that we must not teach political science or citizenship at school the schoolmaster who attempted it would soon find himself penniless in the streets without pupils if not in the dock pleading to a pompously worded indictment for sedition against the exploiters our schools teach the morality of feudalism corrupted by commercialism and hold up the military conqueror the robber baron and the profiteer as models of the illustrious and the successful in vain do the prophets who see through this imposture preach and teach a better gospel the individuals whom they convert are doomed to pass away in a few years and the new generations are dragged back in the schools to the morality of the fifteenth century and think themselves liberal when they are defending the ideas of henry vii and

and then stops and looks round and then i tell him to go on and he pulls a minute again and then stops and looks round x x d x x co no x x d said rollo laughing x x che must not do so he must keep pulling steadily all the time x x d x x cyes so you see he has something more to do than merely to pull he must pull right and he must be taught to do this besides he must learn to obey all my various commands why a horse needs to be taught to work as much as a boy x x d x x cwhy father i can work and i have never been taught x x d x x co no x x d said his father smiling x x cyou cannot work x x d x x ci can plant beans x x d said rollo just then rollo who was all this time riding on the horse looked down from his high seat into a little bush by the side of the road and saw there a little bunch that looked like a birdsnest and he said x x co father please to take me down i want to look at that birdsnest x x d his father knew that he would not hurt the birdsnest so he took him off of the horse and put him on the ground then he walked on with the horse and rollo turned back to see the nest he climbed up upon a log that lay by the side of the bush and then gently opened the branches and looked in four little unfledged birds lifted up their heads and opened their mouths wide they heard the noise which rollo made and thought it was their mother come to feed them x x cah you little dickeys x x d said rollo x x chungry are you i have not got any thing for you to eat x x d rollo looked at them a little while and then slowly got down and walked along up the lane saying to himself x x c they are not big enough to work at any rate but i am i know and i do not believe but that elky is x x d preparations when rollo got back into the yard he found his father just getting into the wagon to go away jonas stood by the horse having just finished harnessing him x x cfather x x d said rollo x x ci can work you thought i could not work but i can i am going to work to day while you are gone x x d x x care you x x d said his father x x cvery well i should be glad to have you x x d x x cwhat should you like to have me do x x d asked rollo x x co you may pick up chips or pile that short wood in the shed but stand back from the wheel for i am going to start now x x d so rollo stood back and his father drew up the reins which jonas had just put into his hands and guided the horse slowly and carefully out of the yard rollo ran along behind the wagon as far as the gate to see his father go off and stood there a few minutes watching him as he rode along until he disappeared at a turn in the road he then came back to the yard and sat down on a log by the side of jonas who was busily at work mending the wheelbarrow rollo sat singing to himself for some time and then he said x x cjonas father thinks i am not big enough to work don x x t you think i am x x d x x ci don x x t know x x d said jonas hesitating x x cyou do not seem to be very industrious just now x x d x x co i am resting now x x d said rollo x x ci am going to work pretty soon x x d x x cwhat are you resting from x x d said jonas x x co i am resting because i am tired x x d x x cwhat are you tired of x x d said jonas x x cwhat have you been doing x x d rollo had no answer at hand for he had not been doing any thing at all the truth was it was pleasanter for him to sit on the log and sing and see jonas mend the wheelbarrow than to go to work himself and he mistook that feeling for being tired boys often do so when they are set to work rollo finding that he had no excuse for sitting there any longer presently got up and sauntered along towards the house saying that he was going to work picking up chips now there was in a certain corner of the yard a considerable space covered with chips which were the ones that rollo had to pick up he knew that his father wished to have them put into a kind of a bin in the shed called the chip bin so he went into the house for a basket he found his mother busy and she said she could not go and get a basket for him but she told him the chip basket was probably in its place in the shed and he might go and get that x x cbut x x d said rollo x x cthat is too large i cannot lift that great basket full of chips x x d x x cyou need not fill it full then x x d said his mother x x cput in just as many as you can easily carry x x d rollo still objected saying that he wanted her very much to go and get a smaller one he could not work without a smaller one x x cvery well x x d said she x x ci would rather that you should not work then the interruption to me to get up now and go to look for a smaller basket will be greater than all the good you will do in picking up chips x x d rollo then told her that his father wanted him to work and he related to her all the conversation they had had she then thought that she had better do all in her power to give rollo a fair experiment so she left her work went down got him a basket which he said was just big enough and left him at the door going out to his work in the yard a bad beginning rollo sat down on the ch

reverse direction by reducing the principles of mechanics to those of electricity and this especially as confidence in the strict validity of the equations of newton s mechanics was shaken by the experiments with beta rays and rapid kathode rays this dualism still confronts us in unextenuated form in the theory of hertz where matter appears not only as the bearer of velocities kinetic energy and mechanical pressures but also as the bearer of electromagnetic fields since such fields also occur in vacuo i e in free ether the ether also appears as bearer of electromagnetic fields the ether appears indistinguishable in its functions from ordinary matter within matter it takes part in the motion of matter and in empty space it has everywhere a velocity so that the ether has a definitely assigned velocity throughout the whole of space there is no fundamental difference between hertz s ether and ponderable matter which in part subsists in the ether the hertz theory suffered not only from the defect of ascribing to matter and ether on the one hand mechanical states and on the other hand electrical states which do not stand in any conceivable relation to each other it was also at variance with the result of fizeau s important experiment on the velocity of the propagation of light in moving fluids and with other established experimental results such was the state of things when h a lorentz entered upon the scene he brought theory into harmony with experience by means of a wonderful simplification of theoretical principles he achieved this the most important advance in the theory of electricity since maxwell by taking from ether its mechanical and from matter its electromagnetic qualities as in empty space so too in the interior of material bodies the ether and not matter viewed atomistically was exclusively the seat of electromagnetic fields according to lorentz the elementary particles of matter alone are capable of carrying out movements their electromagnetic activity is entirely confined to the carrying of electric charges thus lorentz succeeded in reducing all electromagnetic happenings to maxwell s equations for free space as to the mechanical nature of the lorentzian ether it may be said of it in a somewhat playful spirit that immobility is the only mechanical property of which it has not been deprived by h a lorentz it may be added that the whole change in the conception of the ether which the special theory of relativity brought about consisted in taking away from the ether its last mechanical quality namely its immobility how this is to be understood will forthwith be expounded the space time theory and the kinematics of the special theory of relativity were modelled on the maxwell lorentz theory of the electromagnetic field this theory therefore satisfies the conditions of the special theory of relativity but when viewed from the latter it acquires a novel aspect for if k be a system of co ordinates relatively to which the lorentzian ether is at rest the maxwell lorentz equations are valid primarily with reference to k but by the special theory of relativity the same equations without any change of meaning also hold in relation to any new system of co ordinates k which is moving in uniform translation relatively to k now comes the anxious question why must i in the theory distinguish the k system above all k systems which are physically equivalent to it in all respects by assuming that the ether is at rest relatively to the k system for the theoretician such an asymmetry in the theoretical structure with no corresponding asymmetry in the system of experience is intolerable if we assume the ether to be at rest relatively to k but in motion relatively to k the physical equivalence of k and k seems to me from the logical standpoint not indeed downright incorrect but nevertheless inacceptable the next position which it was possible to take up in face of this state of things appeared to be the following the ether does not exist at all the electromagnetic fields are not states of a medium and are not bound down to any bearer but they are independent realities which are not reducible to anything else exactly like the atoms of ponderable matter this conception suggests itself the more readily as according to lorentz s theory electromagnetic radiation like ponderable matter brings impulse and energy with it and as according to the special theory of relativity both matter and radiation are but special forms of distributed energy ponderable mass losing its isolation and appearing as a special form of energy more careful reflection teaches us however that the special theory of relativity does not compel us to deny ether we may assume the existence of an ether only we must give up ascribing a definite state of motion to it i e we must by abstraction take from it the last mechanical characteristic which lorentz had still left it we shall see later that this point of view the conceivability of which i shall at once endeavour to make more intelligible by a somewhat halting comparison is justified by the results of the general theory of relativity think of waves on the surface of water here we can describe two entirely different things either we may observe how the undulatory surface forming the boundary between water and air alters in the course of time or else with the help of small floats for instance we can observe how the position of the separate particles of water alters in the course of time if the existence of such floats for tracking the motion of the particles of a fluid were a fundamental impossibility in physics if in fact nothing else whatever were observable than the shape of the space occupied by the water as it varies in time we should have no ground for the assumption that wa

entrance he nodded but waited until the door was closed behind the retreating servant before he spoke good of you to come nigel he said bring your chair up here bad news the newcomer enquired damnable there was a brief silence during which nigel knowing his uncle s humours leaned back in his chair and waited upon the table was a little pile of closely written manuscript and by their side several black bound code books upon which the f o private still remained though almost obliterated with time lord dorminster s occupation was apparent he was decoding a message of unusual length presently he turned away from the table however and faced his nephew his hands travelled to his waistcoat pocket he drew out a cigarette from a thin gold case lit it and began to smoke then he crossed his legs and leaned a little farther back in his chair nigel he said we are living in strange times no one denies that sir was the grave assent lord dorminster glanced at the calendar which stood upon the desk to day he continued is the twenty third day of march nineteen hundred and thirty four fifteen years ago that terrible peace treaty was signed since then you know what the history of our country has been i am not blowing my own trumpet when i say that nearly every man with true political insight has been cast adrift at the present moment the country is in the hands of a body of highly respectable and well meaning men who as a parish council might conduct the affairs of dorminster town with unqualified success as statesmen they do not exist it seems to me nigel that you and i are going to see in reality that spectre which terrified the world twenty years ago we are going to see the breaking up of a mighty empire tell me what has happened or is going to happen nigel begged well for one thing his uncle replied the emperor of the east is preparing for a visit to europe he will be here probably next month you know whom i mean of course prince shan nigel exclaimed prince shan of china lord dorminster assented his coming links up many things which had been puzzling me i tell you nigel what happens during prince shan s visit will probably decide the destinies of this country and yet i wouldn t mind betting you a thousand to one that there isn t a single official of the government who has the slightest idea as to why he is coming or that he is coming at all do you know nigel asked i can only surmise let us leave prince shan for the moment nigel now listen you go about a great deal what do people say about me honestly i mean speak with your face to the light they call you a faddist and a scaremonger nigel confessed yet there are one or two especially at the st philip s club diplomatists and ambassadors whose place in the world has passed away who think and believe differently you know sir that i am amongst them lord dorminster nodded kindly well he said i fancy i am about to prove myself seven years ago it was he went on reminiscently when the new national party came into supreme power you know one of their first battle cries down with all secret treaties down with all secret diplomacy let nothing exist but an honest commercial understanding between the different countries of the world how germany and russia howled with joy in place of an english statesman with his country s broad interests at heart we have in berlin and petrograd half a dozen representatives of the great industries whose object in their own words is i believe to develop friendly commercialism and a feeling of brotherhood between the nations not only our ambassadors but our secret service were swept clean out of existence i remember going to broadley the day he was appointed foreign minister and i asked him a simple question i asked him whether he did not consider it his duty to keep his finger upon the pulses of the other great nations however friendly they might seem to keep himself assured that all these expressions of good will were honourable and that in the heart of the german nation that great craving for revenge which is the natural heritage of the present generation had really become dissipated broadley smiled at me lord dorminster he said the chief cause of wars in the past has been suspicion we look upon espionage as a disgraceful practice it is the people of germany with whom we are in touch now not a military oligarchy and the people of germany no more desire war than we do besides there is the league of nations those were broadley s views then and they are his views to day you know what i did nigel assented cautiously i suppose it is an open secret amongst a few of us he observed you have been running an unofficial secret service of your own precisely i have had a few agents at work for over a year and when i have finished decoding this last dispatch i shall have evidence which will prove beyond a doubt that we are on the threshold of terrible events the worst of it is well we have been found out what do you mean nigel asked quickly his uncle s sensitive lips quivered you knew sidwell quite well sidwell was found stabbed to the heart in a caf in petrograd three weeks ago lord dorminster announced an official report of the enquiry into his death informs his relatives that his death was due to a quarrel with some russian sailors over one of the women of the quarter where he was found horrible nigel muttered

would change it indeed if he ever thought of such a calamity it was seasoned by the vague feeling that he could make her rich enough to purchase perhaps and extinguish the name of the fellow who married her why not since as it seemed women were equal to men nowadays and soames secretly convinced that they were not passed his curved hand over his face vigorously till it reached the comfort of his chin thanks to abstemious habits he had not grown fat and flabby his nose was pale and thin his grey moustache close clipped his eyesight unimpaired a slight stoop closened and corrected the

painter on his spot the fellow had impressed him great range real genius highly as the chap ranked he would rank even higher before they had finished with him the second goya craze would be greater even than the first oh yes and he had bought on that visit he had as never before commissioned a copy of a fresco painting called la vendimia wherein was the figure of a girl with an arm akimbo who had reminded him of his daughter he had it now in the gallery at mapledurham and rather poor it was you couldn t copy goya he would still look at it however if his daughter were not there for the sake

dogs on several strings and try to sell one to his mother king charles spaniels italian greyhounds affectionate to her crinoline you never saw them now you saw no quality of any sort indeed just

trees the same the trees indifferent to the generations and declensions of mankind a democratic england dishevelled hurried noisy and seemingly without an apex and that something fastidious in the soul of soames turned over within him gone for ever the close borough of rank and polish wealth there was oh yes wealth he himself was a richer man than his father had ever been but manners flavour quality all gone engulfed in one vast ugly shoulder rubbing petrol smelling cheerio little half beaten pockets of gentility and caste lurking here and there dispersed and chetif as annette would say but nothing ever again firm and coherent to look up to and into this new hurly burly of bad manners and loose morals his daughter flower of his life was flung and when those labour chaps got power if they ever did the worst was yet to come he passed out under the archway at last no longer thank goodness disfigured by the gun grey of its search light they d better put a search light on to where

there he was tall ponderous neat clean shaven with his smooth hair hardly thinned smelling no doubt of the best hair wash and a pink paper in his hand well he didn t change and for perhaps the first

and fight with billions if he s really nice he may take me off your hands jimmy i d like to see him try that young man growled with unexpected fierceness well his name is john philip wingate kendrick told them he started life i believe as a journalist then he inherited a fortune and made another one on wall street where i imagine he came across dreadnought phipps what happened i don t exactly know he went on ruminatively phipps couldn t have squeezed him or we should have heard about it but somehow or other the two got at loggerheads for it s common knowledge amongst their business connections i don t know that they have any friends that wingate has sworn to break phipps there will be quite a commotion in the city when it gets about that wingate is here or on his way over it s almost like a

seem in the least terrifying is mr wingate like that or is he a dourer type john wingate kendrick said reflectively is a much younger man than phipps i should say that he wasn t more than thirty five and much better looking i must say that in a struggle i shouldn t know which to back wingate has sentiment and phipps has none conscience of which phipps hasn t a shred and a sense of honour with which phipps was certainly never troubled these points are all against him in a market duel but on the other hand he has a bigger outlook than phipps he has nerves of steel and the grit of a hero did i tell you by the by that he went into the war as a private and came out a brigadier splendid sarah murmured now tell us where peter phipps comes in well kendrick continued phipps attracts sympathy because of his lavish hospitality and apparent generosity whilst wingate is a man of many reserves and has few friends either on this side or the other then phipps i should say is the wealthier man and in this present deal at any rate he has marvellous support so that financially he must tower over wingate then too i think he understands the tricks of the market better over here and he has a very dangerous confederate in skinflint martin what that old blackguard doesn t know of chicanery and crooked dealing the devil himself couldn t make use of if he s put his own money into b i i should say that phipps can t be broken my advice to wingate at any rate when we meet will be to stand by for a time the sound of approaching voices warned them that their seclusion was on the point of being

distinctively social aspects of london the general artlessly histrionised air of things caused so many examples to spring from behind any hedge what came up however at once for my own stretched canvas was that it would have to be ample give me really space to turn round and that a single illustrative case might easily be meagre fare the young man who should chuck admired politics and of course some other admired object with them would be all very well but he wouldn t be enough therefore what should one say to some other young man who would chuck something and somebody else admired in their way too there need never at the worst be any difficulty about the things advantageously chuckable for art the question is all but of choosing them in the heap yet were i to represent a struggle an interesting one indispensably with the passions of the theatre as a profession or at least as an absorption i should have to place the theatre in another light than the satiric this however would by good luck be perfectly possible too without a sacrifice of truth and i should doubtless even be able to make my theatric case as important as i might desire it it seemed clear that i needed big cases small ones would practically give my central idea away and i make out now my still labouring under the illusion that the case of the sacrifice for art can ever be with truth with taste with discretion involved apparently and showily big i daresay it glimmered upon me even then that the very sharpest difficulty of the victim of the conflict i should seek to represent and the very highest interest of his predicament dwell deep in the fact that his repudiation of the great obvious great moral or functional or useful character shall just have to consent to resemble a surrender for absolutely nothing those characters are all large and expansive seated and established and endowed whereas the most charming truth about the preference for art is that to parade abroad so thoroughly inward and so naturally embarrassed a matter is to falsify and vulgarise it that as a preference attended with the honours of publicity it is indeed nowhere that in fact under the rule of its sincerity its only honours are those of contradiction concentration and a seemingly deplorable indifference to everything but itself nothing can well figure as less big in an honest thesis than a marked instance of somebody s willingness to pass mainly for an ass of these things i must i say have been in strictness aware what i perhaps failed of was to note that if a certain romantic glamour even that of mere eccentricity or of a fine perversity may be flung over the act of exchange of a career for the esthetic life in general the prose and the modesty of the matter yet come in with any exhibition of the particular branch of esthetics selected then it is that the attitude of hero or heroine may look too much for the romantic effect like a low crouching over proved trifles art indeed has in our day taken on so many honours and emoluments that the recognition of its importance is more than a custom has become on occasion almost a fury the line is drawn especially in the english world only at the importance of heeding what it may mean the more i turn my pieces over at any rate the more i now see i must have found in them and i remember how once well in presence of my three typical examples my fear of too ample a canvas quite dropped the only question was that if i had marked my political case from so far back for a story by itself and then marked my theatrical case for another the joining together of these interests originally seen as separate might all disgracefully betray the seam show for mechanical and superficial a story was a story a picture a picture and i had a mortal horror of two stories two pictures in one the reason of this was the clearest my subject was immediately under that disadvantage so cheated of its indispensable centre as to become of no more use for expressing a main intention than a wheel without a hub is of use for moving a cart it was a fact apparently that one had on occasion seen two pictures in one were there not for instance certain sublime tintorettos at venice a measureless crucifixion in especial which showed without loss of authority half a dozen actions separately taking place yes that might be but there had surely been nevertheless a mighty pictorial fusion so that the virtue of composition had somehow thereby come all mysteriously to its own of course the affair would be simple enough if composition could be kept out of the question yet by what art or process what bars and bolts what unmuzzled dogs and pointed guns perform that feat i had to know myself utterly inapt for any such valour and recognise that to make it possible sundry things should have begun for me much further back than i had felt them even in their dawn a picture without composition slights its most precious chance for beauty and is moreover not composed at all unless the painter knows how that principle of health and safety working as an absolutely premeditated art has prevailed there may in its absence be life incontestably as the newcomes has life as les trois mousquetaires as tolstoi s peace and war have it but what do such large loose baggy monsters with their queer elements of the accidental and the arbitrary artistically mean we have heard it maintained we well remember that such things are superior to art but we understand least of all what that may mean and we look in vain for the artist the divine explanatory genius who will come to our aid and tell us there is life and life and as waste is only life sacrificed and thereby prevented from counting i delight in a deep breathing economy and an orga

there was a brief silence during which nigel knowing his uncle s humours leaned back in his chair and waited upon the table was a little pile of closely written manuscript and by their side several black bound code books upon which the f o private still remained though almost obliterated with time lord dorminster s occupation was apparent he was decoding a message of unusual length presently he turned away from the table however and faced his nephew his hands travelled to his waistcoat pocket he drew out a cigarette from a thin gold case lit it and began to smoke then he crossed his legs and leaned a little farther back in his chair nigel he said we are living in strange times no one denies that sir was the grave assent lord dorminster glanced at the calendar which stood upon the desk to day he continued is the twenty third day of march nineteen hundred and thirty four fifteen years ago that terrible peace treaty was signed since then you know what the history of our country has been i am not blowing my own trumpet when i say that nearly every man with true political insight has been cast adrift at the present moment the country is in the hands of a body of highly respectable and well meaning men who as a parish council might conduct the affairs of dorminster town with unqualified success as statesmen they do not exist it seems to me nigel that you and i are going to see in reality that spectre which terrified the world twenty years ago we are going to see the breaking up of a mighty empire tell me what has happened or is going to happen nigel begged well for one thing his uncle replied the emperor of the east is preparing for a visit to europe he will be here probably next month you know whom i mean of course prince shan nigel exclaimed prince shan of china lord dorminster assented his coming links up many things which had been puzzling me i tell you nigel what happens during prince shan s visit will probably decide the destinies of this country and yet i wouldn t mind betting you a thousand to one that there isn t a single official of the government who has the slightest idea as to why he is coming or that he is coming at all do you know nigel asked i can only surmise let us leave prince shan for the moment nigel now listen you go about a great deal what do people say about me honestly i mean speak with your face to the light they call you a faddist and a scaremonger nigel confessed yet there are one or two especially at the st philip s club diplomatists and ambassadors whose place in the world has passed away who think and believe differently you know sir that i am amongst them lord dorminster nodded kindly well he said i fancy i am about to prove myself seven years ago it was he went on reminiscently when the new national party came into supreme power you know one of their first battle cries down with all secret treaties down with all secret diplomacy let nothing exist but an honest commercial understanding between the different countries of the world how germany and russia howled with joy in place of an english statesman with his country s broad interests at heart we have in berlin and petrograd half a dozen representatives of the great industries whose object in their own words is i believe to develop friendly commercialism and a feeling of brotherhood between the nations not only our ambassadors but our secret service were swept clean out of existence i remember going to broadley the day he was appointed foreign minister and i asked him a simple question i asked him whether he did not consider it his duty to keep his finger upon the pulses of the other great nations however friendly they might seem to keep himself assured that all these expressions of good will were honourable and that in the heart of the german nation that great craving for revenge which is the natural heritage of the present generation had really become dissipated broadley smiled at me lord dorminster he said the chief cause of wars in the past has been suspicion we look upon espionage as a disgraceful practice it is the people of germany with whom we are in touch now not a military oligarchy and the people of germany no more desire war than we do besides there is the league of nations those were broadley s views then and they are his views to day you know what i did nigel assented cautiously i suppose it is an open secret amongst a few of us he observed you have been running an unofficial secret service of your own precisely i have had a few agents at work for over a year and when i have finished decoding this last dispatch i shall have evidence which will prove beyond a doubt that we are on the threshold of terrible events the worst of it is well we have been found out what do you mean nigel asked quickly his uncle s sensitive lips quivered you knew sidwell quite well sidwell was found stabbed to the heart in a caf in petrograd three weeks ago lord dorminster announced an official report of the enquiry into his death informs his relatives that his death was due to a quarrel with some russian sailors over one of the women of the quarter where he was found horrible nigel muttered

insolent boor wulf of steyning and some day i will punish you as you deserve some day the saxon laughed we shall i hope see you and all your tribe sent across the channel there are few of us here who would not see your backs with pleasure what is this an imperious voice demanded and turning round wulf saw william the norman bishop of london who followed by several monks and pages had pushed his way through the crowd walter fitz urse what means this altercation the saxon ran against me of set purpose my lord walter fitz urse said in tones of deep humility and because i complained he challenged me to ride with him into the country to fight and then he said he hoped that some day all the normans would be sent across the channel is this so the prelate said sternly to wulf did you

would some day be packed across the channel your ears ought to be slit as an insolent varlet i meant no insolence my lord bishop and as to the slitting of my ears i fancy earl harold my master would have something to say on that score the prelate was about to reply but glancing at the angry faces of the growing crowd he said coldly i shall lay the matter before him come walter enough of this you are also somewhat to blame for not having received more courteously the apologies of this saucy page the crowd fell back with angry mutterings as he turned and followed by walter fitz urse and the ecclesiastics made his way along the street to the principal entrance of the palace without waiting to watch his departure wulf the saxon page pushed his way through the crowd and went off at full

charcoal indicated that he was a smith remarked to a gossip as the little crowd broke up but it is a grievous pity that he was brought up a norman still more that he was not left in peace to pass his life as a monk as he desired he fills the land with his normans soon as an english bishop dies straightway a norman is clapped into his place all the offices at court are filled with them and it is seldom a word of honest english is spoken in the palace the norman castles are rising over the land and his favourites divide among them the territory of every english earl or thane who incurs the king s displeasure were it not for earl harold one might as well be under norman sway altogether nay nay neighbour ulred matters are not so bad as that i dare say they would have been as you say had it not been for earl godwin and his sons but it was a great check that godwin gave them when he returned after his banishment and the norman bishops and nobles hurried across the seas in a panic for years now the king has left all matters in the hands of harold and is well content if only he can fast and pray like any monk and give all his thoughts and treasure to the building of yonder abbey we want neither a monk nor a norman over us the smith said roughly still less one who is both norman and monk i would rather have a dane like canute who was a strong man and a firm one than this king who i doubt not is full of good intentions and is a holy and pious monarch but who is not strong enough for a ruler he leaves it to another to preserve england in peace to keep in order the great earls of mercia and the north to hold the land against harold of norway sweyn and others and above all to watch the normans across the water a monk is well enough in a convent but truly tis bad for a country to have a monk as its king there have been some war loving prelates ulred men as ambitious as any of the great earls and more dangerous because they have learning ay there have been great prelates the smith agreed look at lyfing of worcester to whom next only to godwin the king owed his throne he was an englishman first and a bishop afterwards and was a proof if needed that a man can be a great churchman and a great patriot and statesman too it was he rather than godwin who overcame the opposition of the danish party and got the witan at last to acquiesce in the choice of london and wessex and to give their vote to edward well was it he did so for had he failed we should have had as great a struggle in england as when alfred battled against the danes we of london and the men of wessex under the great earl were bent upon being ruled by a prince of our own blood the last two danish kings had shown us that anything is better than being governed by the northmen it was lyfing who persuaded the earl of mercia to side with wessex rather than with northumbria but since lyfing what great englishman have we had in the church every bishopric was granted by edward to norman priests until godwin and his sons got the upper hand after their exile since then most of them have been given to germans it wou

history have a queer fascination for me that perhaps has its roots in occurrences or dreams of which this is not the place to speak lastly now and again i read one of the latin or greek authors in a translation since i regret to say that my lack of education does not enable me to do so in the original but for modern fiction i have no taste although from time to time i sample it in a railway train and occasionally am amused by such excursions into the poetic and unreal so it came about that the more good bothered me to read this particular romance the more i determined that i would do nothing of the sort being a persistent person however when he went away about ten o clock at night he deposited it by my side under my nose indeed so that it might not be overlooked thus it came about that i could not help seeing some egyptian hieroglyphics in an oval on the cover also the title and underneath it your own name my friend all of which excited my curiosity especially the title which was brief and enigmatic consisting indeed of one word she i took up the work and on opening it the first thing my eye fell upon was a picture of a veiled woman the sight of which made my heart stand still so painfully did it remind me of a certain veiled woman whom once it had been my fortune to meet glancing from it to the printed page one word seemed to leap at me it was k r now of veiled women there are plenty in the world but were there also two k rs then i turned to the beginning and began to read this happened in the autumn when the sun does not rise till about six but it was broad daylight before i ceased from reading or rather rushing through that book oh what was i to make of it for here in its pages to say nothing of old billali who by the way lied probably to order when he told mr holly that no white man had visited his country for many generations and those gloomy man eating amahagger scoundrels once again i found myself face to face with she who commands now rendered as she who must be obeyed which means much the same thing in her case at least yes with ayesha the lovely the mystic the changeful and the imperious moreover the history filled up many gaps in my own limited experiences of that enigmatical being who was half divine though i think rather wicked or at any rate unmoral in her way and yet all woman it is true that it showed her in lights very different from and higher than those in which she had presented herself to me yet the substratum of her character was the same or rather of her characters for of these she seemed to have several in a single body being as she said of herself to me not one but many and not here but everywhere further i found the story of kallikrates which i had set down as a mere falsehood invented for my bewilderment expanded and explained or rather not explained since perhaps that she might deceive to me she had spoken of this murdered kallikrates without enthusiasm as a handsome person to whom because of an indiscretion of her youth she was bound by destiny and whose return somewhat to her sorrow she must wait at least she did so at first though in the end when she bared her heart at the moment of our farewell she vowed she loved him only and was appointed to him by a divine decree also i found other things of which i knew nothing such as the fire of life with its fatal gift of indefinite existence although i remember that like the giant rezu whom umslopogaas defeated she did talk of a cup of life of which she had drunk that might have been offered to my lips had i been politic bowed the knee and shown more faith in her and her supernatural pretensions lastly i saw the story of her end and as i read it i wept yes i confess i wept although i feel sure that she will return again now i understood why she had quailed and even seemed to shrivel when in my last interview with her stung beyond endurance by her witcheries and sarcasms i had suggested that even for her with all her powers fate might reserve one of its shrewdest blows some prescience had told her that if the words seemed random truth spoke through my lips although and this was the worst of it she did not know what weapon would deal the stroke or when and where it was doomed to fall i was amazed i was overcome but as i closed that book i made up my mind first that i would continue to preserve absolute silence as to ayesha and my dealings with her as during my life i was bound by oath to do and secondly that i would not cause my manuscript to be destroyed i did not feel that i had any right to do so in view of what already had been published to the world there let it lie to appear one day or not to appear as might be fated meanwhile my lips were sealed i would give good back his book without comment and buy another copy one more word it is clear that i did not touch more than the fringe of the real ayesha in a thousand ways she bewitched and deceived me so that i never plumbed her nature s depths perhaps this was my own fault because from the first i shewed a lack of faith in her and she wished to pay me back in her own fashion or perhaps she had other private reasons for her secrecy certainly the character she discovered to me differed in many ways from that which she revealed to mr holly and to leo vincey or kallikrates whom it seems once she slew in her jealousy and rage she told me as much as she thought it fit that i should know and no more allan quatermain the grange yorkshire she and allan chapter i the talisman i believe it was the old egyptians a very wise people probably indeed

jeeves at any rate for the last five years he has been living at this place of his down in lincolnshire as confirmed a species shunning hermit as ever put fresh water in the tank every second day and refused to see a soul that s why i was so amazed when you told me he had suddenly risen to the surface like this i still can t believe it i am inclined to think that there must be some mistake and that this bird who has been calling here is some different variety of fink nottle the chap i know wears horn rimmed spectacles and has a face like a fish how does that check up with your data the gentleman who came to the flat wore horn rimmed spectacles sir and looked like something on a slab possibly there was a certain suggestion of the piscine sir then it must be gussie i suppose but what on earth can have brought him up to london i am in a position to explain that sir mr fink nottle confided to me his motive in visiting the metropolis he came because the young lady is here young lady yes sir you don t mean he s in love yes sir well i m dashed i m really dashed i positively am dashed jeeves and i was too i mean to say a joke s a joke but there are limits then i found my mind turning to another aspect of this rummy affair conceding the fact that gussie fink nottle against all the ruling of the form book might have fallen in love why should he have been haunting my flat like this no doubt the occasion was one of those when a fellow needs a friend but i couldn t see what had made him pick on me it wasn t as if he and i were in any way bosom we had seen a lot of each other at one time of course but in the last two years i hadn t had so much as a post card from him i put all this to jeeves odd his coming to me still if he did he did no argument about that it must have been a nasty jar for the poor perisher when he found i wasn t here no sir mr fink nottle did not call to see you sir pull yourself together jeeves you ve just told me that this is what he has been doing and assiduously at that it was i with whom he was desirous of establishing communication sir you but i didn t know you had ever met him i had not had that pleasure until he called here sir but it appears that mr sipperley a fellow student of whom mr fink nottle had been at the university recommended him to place his affairs in my hands the mystery had conked i saw all as i dare say you know jeeves s reputation as a counsellor has long been established among the cognoscenti and the first move of any of my little circle on discovering themselves in any form of soup is always to roll round and put the thing up to him and when he s got a out of a bad spot a puts b on to him and then when he has fixed up b b sends c along and so on if you get my drift and so forth that s how these big consulting practices like jeeves s grow old sippy i knew had been deeply impressed by the man s efforts on his behalf at the time when he was trying to get engaged to elizabeth moon so it was not to be wondered at that he should have advised gussie to apply pure routine you might say oh you re acting for him are you yes sir now i follow now i understand and what is gussie s trouble oddly enough sir precisely the same as that of mr sipperley when i was enabled to be of assistance to him no doubt you recall mr sipperley s predicament sir deeply attached to miss moon he suffered from a rooted diffidence which made it impossible for him to speak i nodded i remember yes i recall the sipperley case he couldn t bring himself to the scratch a marked coldness of the feet was there not i recollect you saying he was letting what was it letting something do something cats entered into it if i am not mistaken letting i dare not wait upon i would sir that s right but how about the cats like the poor cat i the adage sir exactly it beats me how you think up these things and gussie you say is in the same posish yes sir each time he endeavours to formulate a proposal of marriage his courage fails him and yet if he wants this female to be his wife he s got to say so what i mean only civil to mention it precisely sir i mused well i suppose this was inevitable jeeves i wouldn t have thought that this fink nottle would ever have fallen a victim to the divine p but if he has no wonder he finds the going sticky yes sir look at the life he s led yes sir i don t suppose he has spoken to a girl for years what a lesson this is to us jeeves not to shut ourselves up in country houses and stare into glass tanks you can t be the dominant male if you do that sort of thing in this life you can choose between two courses you can either shut yourself up in a country house and stare into tanks or you can be a dasher with the sex you can t do both no sir i mused once more gussie and i as i say had rather lost touch but all the same i was exercised about the poor fish as i am about all my pals close or distant who find themselves treading upon life s banana skins it seemed to me that he was up against it i threw my mind back to the last time i had seen him about two years ago it had been i had looked in at his place while on a motor trip and he had put me right off my feed by

for i guess the trouble is they never have been hunted themselves and don t know how it feels sometimes i think i ll hunt one some day just to teach him a lesson what are you laughing at peter at the idea of you hunting a man replied peter your heart is all right lightfoot but you are too timid and gentle to frighten any one big as you are i wouldn t fear you with a single swift bound lightfoot sprang out in front of peter he stamped his sharp hoofs lowered his handsome head until the sharp points of his antlers which people call horns pointed straight at peter lifted the hair along the back of his neck and made a motion as if to plunge at him his eyes which peter had always thought so soft and gentle seemed to flash fire oh cried peter in a faint frightened sounding voice and leaped to one side before it entered his foolish little head that lightfoot was just pretending lightfoot chuckled did you say i couldn t frighten any one he demanded i i didn t know you could look so terribly fierce stammered peter those antlers look really dangerous when you point them that way why why what is that hanging to them it looks like bits of old fur have you been tearing somebody s coat lightfoot peter s eyes were wide with wonder and suspicion chapter ii lightfoot s new antlers peter rabbit was puzzled he stared at lightfoot the deer a wee bit suspiciously have you been tearing somebody s coat he asked again he didn t like to think it of lightfoot whom he always had believed quite as gentle harmless and timid as himself but what else could he think lightfoot slowly shook his head no said he i haven t torn anybody s coat then what are those rags hanging on your antlers demanded peter lightfoot chuckled they are what is left of the coverings of my new antlers he explained what s that what do you mean by new antlers peter was sitting up very straight with his eyes fixed on lightfoot s antlers as though he never had seen them before just what i said retorted lightfoot what do you think of them i think they are the finest antlers i ve ever had when i get the rest of those rags off they will be as handsome a set as ever was grown in the green forest lightfoot rubbed his antlers against the trunk of a tree till some of the rags hanging to them dropped off peter blinked very hard he was trying to understand and he couldn t finally he said so what kind of a story are you trying to fill me up with he demanded indignantly do you mean to tell me that those are not the antlers that you have had as long as i ve known you how can anything hard like those antlers grow and if those are new ones where are the old ones show me the old ones and perhaps i ll believe that these are new ones the idea of trying to make me believe that antlers grow just like plants i ve seen bossy the cow all summer and i know she has got the same horns she had last summer new antlers indeed you are quite right peter quite right about bossy the cow she never has new horns but that isn t any reason why i shouldn t have new antlers is it replied lightfoot patiently her horns are quite different from my antlers i have a new pair every year you haven t seen me all summer have you peter no i don t remember that i have replied peter trying very hard to remember when he had last seen lightfoot i know you haven t retorted lightfoot i know it because i have been hiding in a place you never visit what have you been hiding for demanded peter for my new antlers to grow replied lightfoot when my new antlers are growing i want to be away by myself i don t like to be seen without them or with half grown ones besides i am very uncomfortable while the new antlers are growing and i want to be alone lightfoot spoke as if he really meant every word he said but still peter couldn t he just couldn t believe that those wonderful great antlers had grown out of lightfoot s head in a single summer where did you leave your old ones and when did they come off he asked and there was doubt in the very tone of his voice they dropped off last spring but i don t remember just where replied lightfoot i was too glad to be rid of them to notice where they dropped you see they were loose and uncomfortable and i hadn t any more use for them because i knew that my new ones would be bigger and better i ve got one more point on each than i had last year lightfoot began once more to rub his antlers against the tree to get off the queer rags hanging to them and to polish the points peter watched in silence for a few minutes then all his suspicions returning he said but you haven t told me anything about those rags hanging to your antlers and you haven t believed what i have already told you retorted lightfoot i don t like telling things to people who won t believe me chapter iii lightfoot tells how his antlers grew it is hard to believe what seems impossible and yet what seems impossible to you may be a very commonplace matter to some one else so it does not do to say that a thing cannot be possible just because you cannot understand how it can be peter rabbit wanted to believe what lightfoot the deer had just told him but somehow he couldn t if he had seen those antlers growing it would have been another matter but he hadn t seen lightfoot since the very last of winter and then lightfoot had worn just such handsome antlers as he now had so peter really couldn

reverse direction by reducing the principles of mechanics to those of electricity and this especially as confidence in the strict validity of the equations of newton s mechanics was shaken by the experiments with beta rays and rapid kathode rays this dualism still confronts us in unextenuated form in the theory of hertz where matter appears not only as the bearer of velocities kinetic energy and mechanical pressures but also as the bearer of electromagnetic fields since such fields also occur in vacuo i e in free ether the ether also appears as bearer of electromagnetic fields the ether appears indistinguishable in its functions from ordinary matter within matter it takes part in the motion of matter and in empty space it has everywhere a velocity so that the ether has a definitely assigned velocity throughout the whole of space there is no fundamental difference between hertz s ether and ponderable matter which in part subsists in the ether the hertz theory suffered not only from the defect of ascribing to matter and ether on the one hand mechanical states and on the other hand electrical states which do not stand in any conceivable relation to each other it was also at variance with the result of fizeau s important experiment on the velocity of the propagation of light in moving fluids and with other established experimental results such was the state of things when h a lorentz entered upon the scene he brought theory into harmony with experience by means of a wonderful simplification of theoretical principles he achieved this the most important advance in the theory of electricity since maxwell by taking from ether its mechanical and from matter its electromagnetic qualities as in empty space so too in the interior of material bodies the ether and not matter viewed atomistically was exclusively the seat of electromagnetic fields according to lorentz the elementary particles of matter alone are capable of carrying out movements their electromagnetic activity is entirely confined to the carrying of electric charges thus lorentz succeeded in reducing all electromagnetic happenings to maxwell s equations for free space as to the mechanical nature of the lorentzian ether it may be said of it in a somewhat playful spirit that immobility is the only mechanical property of which it has not been deprived by h a lorentz it may be added that the whole change in the conception of the ether which the special theory of relativity brought about consisted in taking away from the ether its last mechanical quality namely its immobility how this is to be understood will forthwith be expounded the space time theory and the kinematics of the special theory of relativity were modelled on the maxwell lorentz theory of the electromagnetic field this theory therefore satisfies the conditions of the special theory of relativity but when viewed from the latter it acquires a novel aspect for if k be a system of co ordinates relatively to which the lorentzian ether is at rest the maxwell lorentz equations are valid primarily with reference to k but by the special theory of relativity the same equations without any change of meaning also hold in relation to any new system of co ordinates k which is moving in uniform translation relatively to k now comes the anxious question why must i in the theory distinguish the k system above all k systems which are physically equivalent to it in all respects by assuming that the ether is at rest relatively to the k system for the theoretician such an asymmetry in the theoretical structure with no corresponding asymmetry in the system of experience is intolerable if we assume the ether to be at rest relatively to k but in motion relatively to k the physical equivalence of k and k seems to me from the logical standpoint not indeed downright incorrect but nevertheless inacceptable the next position which it was possible to take up in face of this state of things appeared to be the following the ether does not exist at all the electromagnetic fields are not states of a medium and are not bound down to any bearer but they are independent realities which are not reducible to anything else exactly like the atoms of ponderable matter this conception suggests itself the more readily as according to lorentz s theory electromagnetic radiation like ponderable matter brings impulse and energy with it and as according to the special theory of relativity both matter and radiation are but special forms of distributed energy ponderable mass losing its isolation and appearing as a special form of energy more careful reflection teaches us however that the special theory of relativity does not compel us to deny ether we may assume the existence of an ether only we must give up ascribing a definite state of motion to it i e we must by abstraction take from it the last mechanical characteristic which lorentz had still left it we shall see later that this point of view the conceivability of which i shall at once endeavour to make more intelligible by a somewhat halting comparison is justified by the results of the general theory of relativity think of waves on the surface of water here we can describe two entirely different things either we may observe how the undulatory surface forming the boundary between water and air alters in the course of time or else with the help of small floats for instance we can observe how the position of the separate particles of water alters in the course of time if the existence of such floats for tracking the motion of the particles of a fluid were a fundamental impossibility in physics if in fact nothing else whatever were observable than the shape of the space occupied by the water as it varies in time we should have no ground for the assumption that wa

that looked like a birdsnest and he said x x co father please to take me down i want to look at that birdsnest x x d his father knew that he would not hurt the birdsnest so he took him off of the horse and put him on the ground then he walked on with the horse and rollo turned back to see the nest he climbed up upon a log that lay by the side of the bush and then gently opened the branches and

slowly and carefully out of the yard rollo ran along behind the wagon as far as the gate to see his father go off and stood there a few minutes watching him as he rode along until he disappeared at a turn in the road he then came back to the yard and sat down on a log by the side of jonas who was busily at work mending the wheelbarrow rollo sat singing to himself for some time and then he said x x

said jonas x x cwhat have you been doing x x d rollo had no answer at hand for he had not been doing any thing at all the truth was it was pleasanter for him to sit on the log and sing and see jonas mend the wheelbarrow than to go to work himself and he mistook that feeling for being tired boys often do so when they are set to work rollo finding that he had no excuse for sitting there any longer presently got up and sauntered along towards the house saying that he was going to work picking up chips now there was in a certain corner of the yard a considerable space covered with chips which were the ones that rollo had to pick up he knew that his father wished to have them put into a kind of a bin in the shed called the chip bin so he went into the house for a basket he found his mother busy and she said she could not go and get a basket for him but she told him the chip basket was probably in its place in the shed and he might go and get that x x cbut x x d said rollo x x cthat is

her all the conversation they had had she then thought that she had better do all in her power to give rollo a fair experiment so she left her work went down got him a basket which he said was just

of humiliation jacob felt a little thrill of triumph at the thought of mr bultiwell s three gardeners it took more than gardeners to grow such a rose as he was wearing he liked to fancy that it took personal care personal sympathy personal love the sweetest and rarest flowers must have their special atmosphere quite suddenly mr edward bultiwell laid down his times and glared across at jacob he was a large man with an ugly red face a neck which hung over his collar in rolls and a resonant voice directly he began to speak jacob began to shiver pratt he said am i to understand that the greeting which you offered to the occupants of this carriage when you entered was intended to include me i i certainly meant it to was the tremulous reply then let me beg that such a liberty be not repeated mr bultiwell continued brutally i look upon a man who has compounded with his creditors as a person temporarily at any rate outside the pale of converse with his fellows on er equal terms i look upon your presence in a first class carriage wearing a floral adornment mr bultiwell added with a jealous glance at the very beautiful rose which is to say the least of it conspicuous as er an impertinence to those who have had the misfortune to suffer from your insolvency the healthy colour faded from jacob s cheeks he had the air of one stricken by a lash dazed for the moment and bewildered my rose cost me nothing he faltered and my season ticket doesn t expire till next month i must go up to the city my help is needed with the books mr bultiwell shook his paper preparatory to disappearing behind it your presence here may be considered a matter of taste he fired off as a parting shot i call it damned bad taste mr jacob pratt sat like a hurt thing till the train stopped at the next station then he stumbled out on to the platform and making his way through an unaccountable mist he climbed somehow or other into a third class carriage richard dauncey the melancholy man who lived in the cottage opposite to his looked up at the newcomer s entrance and for the first time within his recollection jacob saw him smile good morning mr pratt the former said with a strenuous attempt at cordiality if you ll excuse my saying so that s the finest rose i ve ever seen in my life richard dauncey made his fortune by that speech and jacob had to swallow very hard and look very fixedly out of the window chapter i precisely two years later jacob pratt sat once more in his cottage sitting room contemplating the remains of a barely tasted breakfast before him read for the fiftieth time were the wonderful letters in his brain a most amazing confusion in his heart an almost hysterical joy presently mrs harris brought in his hat and stick you ll excuse my mentioning it sir she said looking at the former a little disparagingly but brush though i may there s no doing much with this hat of yours the nap s fair gone maybe you haven t noticed it sir but with the summer coming on a straw hat i ll buy a straw hat to day mrs harris jacob promised and you ll be home at the usual time for your supper sir i i expect so i am not quite sure mrs harris i shall be home sometime during the day all right mrs harris shook her head at the sight of the untasted egg you ll excuse my saying so sir she pronounced severely but there s no good work done on an empty stomach times is hard as we all know but eggs is cheap mrs harris jacob reminded her it is two years since i left one of your eggs i left it then because i was miserable i am leaving it this morning because i have had good news i can t eat later on later on mrs harris and a bit of good news is what you deserve sir the latter declared lingering while he cut his accustomed rose with fingers which trembled strangely thank you very much mrs harris he said when i come back to night i ll tell you all about it once more then two years almost to a day after mr edward bultiwell of the great firm of bultiwell and sons had laid down his newspaper and spoken his mind jacob was on his way to the station again wearing a choice rose in his buttonhole he had found no occasion to change his lodgings for he had been an economical man who took great care of his possessions even in the days of his prosperity and his moderate salary as traveller for a bermondsey firm of merchants brought him in quite enough for his simple needs he had to some extent lived down his disgrace the manager of the international stores nodded to him now a trifle condescendingly yet with tacit acknowledgement of the fact that in domestic affairs jacob was a man of principle who always paid his way the greengrocer s wife passed the time of day when not too preoccupied and the newspaper boy no longer clutched for his penny jacob generally met the melancholy man at the corner of the avenue and walked to the station with him and he still grew roses and worshipped them on the way to the station on this particular morning he amazed his friend richard he said i shall not travel to the city with you to day at least i shall not start with you i shall change carriages at wendley as i did once before the devil richard exclaimed they were passing the plate glass window of a new emporium and jacob paused to glance furtively at his reflection he was an exceedingly neat man and his care for his clothes and person had survived two years of impecuniosity nevertheless although he passed muster well enough to the casual observer there were indications in his attire of the inevitable conflict between a desire for adornment and the lack of means to indulge it his too often pressed trousers were thin at the seams his linen thoug

whip tucked under her arm drawing off her stout riding gloves she was a tall splendidly proportioned woman of a superb beauty of countenance for all that she was well past the spring of life in the waning light of that october afternoon none would have guessed her age to be so much as thirty though in the sunlight you might have set it at a little more but in no light at all would you have guessed the truth that her next would be her forty second birthday her face was pale of an ivory pallor that gleamed in sharp contrast with the ebony of her lustrous hair under the long lashes of low lids a pair of eyes black and insolent set off the haughty lines of her scarlet lips her nose was thin and straight her neck an ivory pillar splendidly upright upon her handsome shoulders she was dressed for riding in a gown of sapphire velvet handsomely laced in gold across the stomacher and surmounted at the neck where it was cut low and square by the starched band of fine linen which in france was already replacing the more elaborate ruff on her head over a linen coif she wore a tall crowned grey beaver swathed with a scarf of blue and gold standing by the hearth one foot on the

enough to eat though i am thankful to say that i never have had to do that but to hunt others just for the fun of hunting is something i cannot understand at all and yet that is what men seem to do it for i guess the trouble is they never have been hunted themselves and don t know how it feels sometimes i think i ll hunt one some day just to teach him a lesson what are you laughing at peter at the idea of you hunting a man replied peter your heart is all right lightfoot but you are too timid and gentle to frighten any one big as you are i wouldn t fear you with a single swift bound lightfoot sprang out in front of peter he stamped his sharp hoofs lowered his handsome head until the sharp points of his antlers which people call horns pointed straight at peter lifted the hair along the back of his neck and made a motion as if to plunge at him his eyes which peter had always thought so soft and gentle seemed to flash fire oh cried peter in a faint frightened sounding voice and leaped to one side before it entered his foolish little head that lightfoot was just pretending lightfoot chuckled did you say i couldn t frighten any one he demanded i i didn t know you could look so terribly fierce stammered peter those antlers look really dangerous when you point them that way why why what is that hanging to them it looks like bits of old fur have you been tearing somebody s coat lightfoot peter s eyes were wide with wonder and suspicion chapter ii lightfoot s new antlers peter rabbit was puzzled he stared at lightfoot the deer a wee bit suspiciously have you been tearing somebody s coat he asked again he didn t like to think it of lightfoot whom he always had believed quite as gentle harmless and timid as himself but what else could he think lightfoot slowly shook his head no said he i haven t torn anybody s coat then what are those rags hanging on your antlers demanded peter lightfoot chuckled they are what is left of the coverings of my new antlers he explained what s that what do you mean by new antlers peter was sitting up very straight with his eyes fixed on lightfoot s antlers as though he never had seen them before just what i said retorted lightfoot what do you think of them i think they are the finest antlers i ve ever had when i get the rest of those rags off they will be as handsome a set as ever was grown in the green forest lightfoot rubbed his antlers against the trunk of a tree till some of the rags hanging to them dropped off peter blinked very hard he was trying to understand and he couldn t finally he said so what kind of a story are you trying to fill me up with he demanded indignantly do you mean to tell me that those are not the antlers that you have had as long as i ve known you how can anything hard like those antlers grow and if those are new ones where are the old ones show me the old ones and perhaps i ll believe that these are new ones the idea of trying to make me believe that antlers grow just like plants i ve seen bossy the cow all summer and i know she has got the same horns she had last summer new antlers indeed you are quite right peter quite right about bossy the cow she never has new horns but that isn t any reason why i shouldn t have new antlers is it replied lightfoot patiently her horns are quite different from my antlers i have a new pair every year you haven t seen me all summer have you peter no i don t remember that i have replied peter trying very hard to remember when he had last seen lightfoot i know you haven t retorted lightfoot i know it because i have been hiding in a place you never visit what have you been hiding for demanded peter for my new antlers to grow replied lightfoot when my new antlers are growing i want to be away by myself i don t like to be seen without them or with half grown ones besides i am very uncomfortable while the new antlers are growing and i want to be alone lightfoot spoke as if he really meant every word he said but still peter couldn t he just couldn t believe that those wonderful great antlers had grown out of lightfoot s head in a single summer where did you leave your old ones and when did they come off he asked and there was doubt in the very tone of his voice they dropped off last spring but i don t remember just where replied lightfoot i was too glad to be rid of them to notice where they dropped you see they were loose and uncomfortable and i hadn t any more use for them because i knew that my new ones would be bigger and better i ve got one more point on each than i had last year lightfoot began once more to rub his antlers against the tree to get off the queer rags hanging to them and to polish the points peter watched in silence for a few minutes then all his suspicions returning he said but you haven t told me anything about those rags hanging to your antlers and you haven t believed what i have already told you retorted lightfoot i don t like telling things to people who won t believe me chapter iii lightfoot tells how his antlers grew it is hard to believe what seems impossible and yet what seems impossible to you may be a very commonplace matter to some one else so it does not do to say that a thing cannot be possible just because you cannot understand how it can be peter rabbit wanted to believe what lightfoot the deer had just told him but somehow he couldn t if he had seen those antlers growing it would have been another matter but he hadn t seen lightfoot since the very last of winter and then lightfoot had worn just such handsome antlers as he now had so peter really couldn

too having received a good many knocks at home he kept the hard head out of sight and played at poetry and romance with his literary wife and his sturdy passionate girls he was a man of courage not given to complaining bearing his burdens by himself no he did not let the world intrude far into his home he had a delicate sensitive wife whose poetry won some fame in the narrow world of letters he himself with his tough old barbarian fighting spirit had an almost child like delight in verse in sweet poetry and in the delightful game of a cultured home his blood was strong even to coarseness but that only made the home more vigorous more robust and christmassy there was always a touch of christmas about him now he was well off if there was poetry after dinner there were also chocolates and nuts and good little out of the way things to be munching well then into this family came egbert he was made of quite a different paste the girls and the father were strong limbed thick blooded people true english as holly trees and hawthorn are english their culture was grafted on to them as one might perhaps graft a common pink rose on to a thornstem it flowered oddly enough but it did not alter their blood and egbert was a born rose the age long breeding had left him with a delightful spontaneous passion he was not clever nor even literary no but the intonation of his voice and the movement of his supple handsome body and the fine texture of his flesh and his hair the slight arch of his nose the quickness of his blue eyes would easily take the place of poetry winifred loved him loved him this southerner as a higher being a higher being mind you not a deeper and as for him he loved her in passion with every fibre of him she was the very warm stuff of life to him wonderful then those days at crockham cottage the first days all alone save for the woman who came to work in the mornings marvellous days when she had all his tall supple fine fleshed youth to herself for herself and he had her like a ruddy fire into which he could cast himself for rejuvenation ah that it might never end this passion this marriage the flame of their two bodies burnt again into that old cottage that was haunted already by so much by gone physical desire you could not be in the dark room for an hour without the influences coming over you the hot blood desire of by gone yeomen there in this old den where they had lusted and bred for so many generations the silent house dark with thick timbered walls and the big black chimney place and the sense of secrecy dark with low little windows sunk into the earth dark like a lair where strong beasts had lurked and mated lonely at night and lonely by day left to themselves and their own intensity for so many generations it seemed to cast a spell on the two young people they became different there was a curious secret glow about them a certain slumbering flame hard to understand that enveloped them both they too felt that they did not belong to the london world any more crockham had changed their blood the sense of the snakes that lived and slept even in their own garden in the sun so that he going forward with the spade would see a curious coiled brownish pile on the black soil which suddenly would start up hiss and dazzle rapidly away hissing one day winifred heard the strangest scream from the flower bed under the low window of the living room ah the strangest scream like the very soul of the dark past crying aloud she ran out and saw a long brown snake on the flower bed and in its flat mouth the one hind leg of a frog was striving to escape and screaming its strange tiny bellowing scream she looked at the snake and from its sullen flat head it looked at her obstinately she gave a cry and it released the frog and slid angrily away that was crockham the spear of modern invention had not passed through it and it lay there secret primitive savage as when the saxons first came and egbert and she were caught there caught out of the world he was not idle nor was she there were plenty of things to be done the house to be put into final repair after the workmen had gone cushions and curtains to sew the paths to make the water to fetch and attend to and then the slope of the deep soiled neglected garden to level to terrace with little terraces and paths and to fill with flowers he worked away in his shirt sleeves worked all day intermittently doing this thing and the other and she quiet and rich in herself seeing him stooping and labouring away by himself would come to help him to be near him he of course was an amateur a born amateur he worked so hard and did so little and nothing he ever did would hold together for long if he terraced the garden he held up the earth with a couple of long narrow planks that soon began to bend with the pressure from behind and would not need many years to rot through and break and let the soil slither all down again in a heap towards the stream bed but there you are he had not been brought up to come to grips with anything and he thought it would do nay he did not think there was anything else except little temporary contrivances possible he who had such a passion for his old enduring cottage and for the old enduring things of the bygone england curious that the sense of permanency in the past had such a hold over him whilst in the present he was all amateurish and sketchy winifred could not criticize him town bred everything seemed to her splendid and the very digging and shovelling itself seemed romantic but neither egbert nor she yet realized the difference between work and romance godfrey marshall her father was at first perfect

enough to eat though i am thankful to say that i never have had to do that but to hunt others just for the fun of hunting is something i cannot understand at all and yet that is what men seem to do it for i guess the trouble is they never have been hunted themselves and don t know how it feels sometimes i think i ll hunt one some day just to teach him a lesson what are you laughing at peter at the idea of you hunting a man replied peter your heart is all right lightfoot but you are too timid and gentle to frighten any one big as you are i wouldn t fear you with a single swift bound lightfoot sprang out in front of peter he stamped his sharp hoofs lowered his handsome head until the sharp points of his antlers which people call horns pointed straight at peter lifted the hair along the back of his neck and made a motion as if to plunge at him his eyes which peter had always thought so soft and gentle seemed to flash fire oh cried peter in a faint frightened sounding voice and leaped to one side before it entered his foolish little head that lightfoot was just pretending lightfoot chuckled did you say i couldn t frighten any one he demanded i i didn t know you could look so terribly fierce stammered peter those antlers look really dangerous when you point them that way why why what is that hanging to them it looks like bits of old fur have you been tearing somebody s coat lightfoot peter s eyes were wide with wonder and suspicion chapter ii lightfoot s new antlers peter rabbit was puzzled he stared at lightfoot the deer a wee bit suspiciously have you been tearing somebody s coat he asked again he didn t like to think it of lightfoot whom he always had believed quite as gentle harmless and timid as himself but what else could he think lightfoot slowly shook his head no said he i haven t torn anybody s coat then what are those rags hanging on your antlers demanded peter lightfoot chuckled they are what is left of the coverings of my new antlers he explained what s that what do you mean by new antlers peter was sitting up very straight with his eyes fixed on lightfoot s antlers as though he never had seen them before just what i said retorted lightfoot what do you think of them i think they are the finest antlers i ve ever had when i get the rest of those rags off they will be as handsome a set as ever was grown in the green forest lightfoot rubbed his antlers against the trunk of a tree till some of the rags hanging to them dropped off peter blinked very hard he was trying to understand and he couldn t finally he said so what kind of a story are you trying to fill me up with he demanded indignantly do you mean to tell me that those are not the antlers that you have had as long as i ve known you how can anything hard like those antlers grow and if those are new ones where are the old ones show me the old ones and perhaps i ll believe that these are new ones the idea of trying to make me believe that antlers grow just like plants i ve seen bossy the cow all summer and i know she has got the same horns she had last summer new antlers indeed you are quite right peter quite right about bossy the cow she never has new horns but that isn t any reason why i shouldn t have new antlers is it replied lightfoot patiently her horns are quite different from my antlers i have a new pair every year you haven t seen me all summer have you peter no i don t remember that i have replied peter trying very hard to remember when he had last seen lightfoot i know you haven t retorted lightfoot i know it because i have been hiding in a place you never visit what have you been hiding for demanded peter for my new antlers to grow replied lightfoot when my new antlers are growing i want to be away by myself i don t like to be seen without them or with half grown ones besides i am very uncomfortable while the new antlers are growing and i want to be alone lightfoot spoke as if he really meant every word he said but still peter couldn t he just couldn t believe that those wonderful great antlers had grown out of lightfoot s head in a single summer where did you leave your old ones and when did they come off he asked and there was doubt in the very tone of his voice they dropped off last spring but i don t remember just where replied lightfoot i was too glad to be rid of them to notice where they dropped you see they were loose and uncomfortable and i hadn t any more use for them because i knew that my new ones would be bigger and better i ve got one more point on each than i had last year lightfoot began once more to rub his antlers against the tree to get off the queer rags hanging to them and to polish the points peter watched in silence for a few minutes then all his suspicions returning he said but you haven t told me anything about those rags hanging to your antlers and you haven t believed what i have already told you retorted lightfoot i don t like telling things to people who won t believe me chapter iii lightfoot tells how his antlers grew it is hard to believe what seems impossible and yet what seems impossible to you may be a very commonplace matter to some one else so it does not do to say that a thing cannot be possible just because you cannot understand how it can be peter rabbit wanted to believe what lightfoot the deer had just told him but somehow he couldn t if he had seen those antlers growing it would have been another matter but he hadn t seen lightfoot since the very last of winter and then lightfoot had worn just such handsome antlers as he now had so peter really couldn t be blamed for not being able to believe that those old ones had been lost and in their pla

of humiliation jacob felt a little thrill of triumph at the thought of mr bultiwell s three gardeners it took more than gardeners to grow such a rose as he was wearing he liked to fancy that it took personal care personal sympathy personal love the sweetest and rarest flowers must have their special atmosphere quite suddenly mr edward bultiwell laid down his times and glared across at jacob he was a large man with an ugly red face a neck which hung over his collar in rolls and a resonant voice directly he began to speak jacob began to shiver pratt he said am i to understand that the greeting which you offered to the occupants of this carriage when you entered was intended to include me i i certainly meant it to was the tremulous reply then let me beg that such a liberty be not repeated mr bultiwell continued brutally i look upon a man who has compounded with his creditors as a person temporarily at any rate outside the pale of converse with his fellows on er equal terms i look upon your presence in a first class carriage wearing a floral adornment mr bultiwell added with a jealous glance at the very beautiful rose which is to say the least of it conspicuous as er an impertinence to those who have had the misfortune to suffer from your insolvency the healthy colour faded from jacob s cheeks he had the air of one stricken by a lash dazed for the moment and bewildered my rose cost me nothing he faltered and my season ticket doesn t expire till next month i must go up to the city my help is needed with the books mr bultiwell shook his paper preparatory to disappearing behind it your presence here may be considered a matter of taste he fired off as a parting shot i call it damned bad taste mr jacob pratt sat like a hurt thing till the train stopped at the next station then he stumbled out on to the platform and making his way through an unaccountable mist he climbed somehow or other into a third class carriage richard dauncey the melancholy man who lived in the cottage opposite to his looked up at the newcomer s entrance and for the first time within his recollection jacob saw him smile good morning mr pratt the former said with a strenuous attempt at cordiality if you ll excuse my saying so that s the finest rose i ve ever seen in my life richard dauncey made his fortune by that speech and jacob had to swallow very hard and look very fixedly out of the window chapter i precisely two years later jacob pratt sat once more in his cottage sitting room contemplating the remains of a barely tasted breakfast before him read for the fiftieth time were the wonderful letters in his brain a most amazing confusion in his heart an almost hysterical joy presently mrs harris brought in his hat and stick you ll excuse my mentioning it sir she said looking at the former a little disparagingly but brush though i may there s no doing much with this hat of yours the nap s fair gone maybe you haven t noticed it sir but with the summer coming on a straw hat i ll buy a straw hat to day mrs harris jacob promised and you ll be home at the usual time for your supper sir i i expect so i am not quite sure mrs harris i shall be home sometime during the day all right mrs harris shook her head at the sight of the untasted egg you ll excuse my saying so sir she pronounced severely but there s no good work done on an empty stomach times is hard as we all know but eggs is cheap mrs harris jacob reminded her it is two years since i left one of your eggs i left it then because i was miserable i am leaving it this morning because i have had good news i can t eat later on later on mrs harris and a bit of good news is what you deserve sir the latter declared lingering while he cut his accustomed rose with fingers which trembled strangely thank you very much mrs harris he said when i come back to night i ll tell you all about it once more then two years almost to a day after mr edward bultiwell of the great firm of bultiwell and sons had laid down his newspaper and spoken his mind jacob was on his way to the station again wearing a choice rose in his buttonhole he had found no occasion to change his lodgings for he had been an economical man who took great care of his possessions even in the days of his prosperity and his moderate salary as traveller for a bermondsey firm of merchants brought him in quite enough for his simple needs he had to some extent lived down his disgrace the manager of the international stores nodded to him now a trifle condescendingly yet with tacit acknowledgement of the fact that in domestic affairs jacob was a man of principle who always paid his way the greengrocer s wife passed the time of day when not too preoccupied and the newspaper boy no longer clutched for his penny jacob generally met the melancholy man at the corner of the avenue and walked to the station with him and he still grew roses and worshipped them on the way to the station on this particular morning he amazed his friend richard he said i shall not travel to the city with you to day at least i shall not start with you i shall change carriages at wendley as i did once before the devil richard exclaimed they were passing the plate glass window of a new emporium and jacob paused to glance furtively at his reflection he was an exceedingly neat man and his care for his clothes and person had survived two years of impecuniosity nevertheless although he passed muster well enough to the casual observer there were indications in his attire of the inevitable conflict between a desire for adornment and the lack of means to indulge it his too often pressed trousers were thin at the seams his linen thoug

was seven years old large for his age a bold handsome lad with red hair mrs smith made a bargain with dick and led him back with her here panhandle took violent exception to having his pets killed or routed out by this boy he had never before seen he did not like his looks anyway but dick paid little heed to panhandle except once when mrs smith went into the house and then he knocked panhandle down for once panhandle did not squall he got up round eyed pale with his hands clenched he never said a word something was born in the depths of his gentle soul then dick tore a hole in the little wall of rocks that supported the porch and with a lighted torch on a stick he wormed his way in to rout out the skunks panhandle suddenly was thrilled and frightened by a bellowing from dick the boy came hurriedly backing out of the hole he fetched an odor with him that nearly suffocated panhandle so strange and raw and terrible was it dick s eyes were shut for the time being he had been blinded he bounced around like a chicken with its head cut off bawling wildly what had happened panhandle did not know but it certainly suited him goody goody he shouted holding his nose and edging away from the lad then panhandle saw smoke issuing from the hole under the porch the mother skunk and her kittens scampered out into the weeds he heard the crackle of flames that boy had dropped his torch under the porch screaming panhandle ran to alarm his mother but it was too late there were no men near at hand so nothing could be done panhandle stood crying beside his mother watching their little home burn to the ground somehow in his mind the boy dick had been to blame panhandle peered round to find him but he was gone never would panhandle forget that boy they walked to the uncle s house and spent the night there soon another home was under construction on the same site it was more of a shack than a house for building materials were scarce and the near approach of winter made hasty construction imperative winter came soon and panhandle and his mother were alone it was cold and they huddled over the little wood fire they had plenty to eat but were very uncomfortable in the one room shack bill smith came home but seldom that fall the valley had been overrun with homesteaders nesters they were called and these newcomers passed by often from the town drunk and rough panhandle used to lie awake a good deal during these lonely hours the moan of the prairie wind the mourn of wolves and yelp of coyotes became part of his existence he understood why his mother barred and blocked the one door placed the ax by the bed and the gun under her pillow even then he longed for the time when he would be old and big enough to protect her the lonely winter with its innumerable hours of solitude for mrs smith and the boy had incalculable influence upon his character she taught him much ways and things words and feelings that became an integral part of his life at last the long winter ended with spring came the gales of wind which though no longer cold were terrible in their violence many a night panhandle lay awake shrinking beside his mother fearing the shack would blow away over their heads many a day the sun was obscured and nothing could be cooked no work done while the dust storm raged as spring advanced with a lessening of the tornadoes a new and fascinating game came into panhandle s life it was to sit at the one little window and watch the cowboys ride by how he came to worship them they were on their way to the spring roundups his father had told him all about them panhandle would strain his eyes to get a first glimpse of them to count the shaggy prancing horses the lithe supple riders with their great sombreros their bright scarfs guns and chaps and boots and spurs their lassos how they fascinated panhandle ropes to whirl and throw at a running steer that was a game he resolved to play when he grew up and his mother discovering his interest made him a little reata and taught him how to throw it how to make loops and knots she told him how her people had owned horses thrown lassos run cattle panhandle was always watching for the cowboys when they passed by he would run to the other side of the shack where there was a knothole stuffed with a rag and through this he would peep until he was blinded by dust these were full days for the lad rousing in him wonder and awe eagerness and fear strange longings for he knew not what then one day his father brought home a black pony with three white feet and a white spot on his face panhandle was in rapture for him he could have burst for very joy but he could not speak it developed that his mother would not let him ride the pony except when she led it this roused as great a grief as possession was joy a beautiful little pony he could not ride ideas formed in his mind scintillated and grew into dark purpose one day he stole curly and led him out of sight behind the barn and mounting him rode down to the spring panhandle found himself alone he was free he was on the back of a horse mighty and incalculable fact curly felt the spirit of that occasion after drinking at the spring he broke into a lope panhandle stuck on somehow and turned the pony toward the house curly loped faster panhandle felt the wind in his hair he bounced up and down squealing with delight he

must once have been a plateau of red rock from which the softer strata had eroded leaving the gentle league long slopes marked here and there by upstanding pillars and columns of singular shape and beauty i rode down the sweet scented sage slopes under the shadow of the lofty mittens and around and across the valley and back again to the height of land and when i had completed the ride a story had woven itself into my mind and the spot where i stood was to be the place where lin slone taught lucy bostil to ride the great stallion wildfire illustration there was something beyond the white peaked ranges two days ride took us across country to the segi with this wonderful canyon i was familiar that is as familiar as several visits could make a man with such a bewildering place in fact i had named it deception pass the segi had innumerable branches all more or less the same size and sometimes it was difficult to tell the main canyon from one of its tributaries the walls were rugged and crumbling of a red or yellow hue upward of a thousand feet in height and indented by spruce sided notches there were a number of ruined cliff dwellings the most accessible of which was keet seel i could imagine no more picturesque spot a huge wind worn cavern with a vast slanted stained wall held upon a projecting ledge or shelf the long line of cliff dwellings these silent little stone houses with their vacant black eye like windows had strange power to make me ponder and then dream next day upon resuming our journey it pleased me to try to find the trail to betatakin the most noted and surely the most wonderful and beautiful ruin in all the west in many places there was no trail at all and i encountered difficulties but in the end without much loss of time i entered the narrow rugged entrance of the canyon i had named surprise valley sight of the great dark cave thrilled me as i thought it might have thrilled bess and venters who had lived for me their imagined lives of loneliness here in this wild spot with the sight of those lofty walls and the scent of the dry sweet sage there rushed over me a strange feeling that riders of the purple sage was true my dream people of romance had really lived there once upon a time i climbed high upon the huge stones and along the smooth red walls where pay larkin once had glided with swift sure steps and i entered the musty cliff dwellings and called out to hear the weird and sonorous echoes and i wandered through the thickets and upon the grassy spruce shaded benches never for a moment free of the story i had conceived there something of awe and sadness abided with me i could not enter into the merry pranks and investigations of my party surprise valley seemed a part of my past my dreams my very self i left it haunted by its loneliness and silence and beauty by the story it had given me that night we camped at bubbling spring which once had been a geyser of considerable power wetherill told a story of an old navajo who had lived there for a long time according to the indian tale the old chief resided there without complaining of this geyser that was wont to inundate his fields but one season the unreliable waterspout made great and persistent endeavor to drown him and his people and horses whereupon the old navajo took his gun and shot repeatedly at the geyser and thundered aloud his anger to the great spirit the geyser ebbed away and from that day never burst forth again illustration weird and wonderful monuments in monument valley illustration sunset on the desert illustration cave of the cliff dwellers somewhere under the great bulge of navajo mountain i calculated that we were coming to the edge of the plateau the white bobbing pack horses disappeared and then our extra mustangs it is no unusual thing for a man to use three mounts on this trip then two of our indians disappeared but wetherill waited for us and so did nas ta bega the piute who first took wetherill down into nonnezoshe boco as i came up i thought we had indeed reached the end of the world it s down in there said wetherill with a laugh nas ta bega made a slow sweeping gesture there is always something so significant and impressive about an indian when he points anywhere it is as if he says there way beyond over the ranges is a place i know and it is far the fact was that i looked at the piute s dark inscrutable face before i looked out into the void my gaze then seemed impelled and held by things afar a vast yellow and purple corrugated world of distance apparently now on a level with my eyes i was drawn by the beauty and grandeur of that scene and then i was transfixed almost by fear by the realization that i dared to venture down into this wild and upflung fastness i kept looking afar sweeping the three quarter circle of horizon till my judgment of distance was confounded and my sense of proportion dwarfed one moment and magnified the next wetherill was pointing and explaining but i had not grasped all he said you can see two hundred miles into utah he went on that bright rough surface like a washboard is wind worn rock those little lines of cleavage are canyons there are a thousand canyons down there and only a few have we been in that long purple ragged line is the grand canyon of the colorado and there that blue fork in the red that s where the san juan comes in and there s escalante canyon i had to adopt the indian s method of studying unlimited spaces in the desert to look with slow contracted eyes from near to far the pack train and the drivers had begun to zigzag down a long slope bare of rock with scant strips of green and here and there a cedar half a mile down the slope merged in what seemed a green level but i knew it was not level this level was a

you think you are talking to a norman serf you will please to remember you are in england but if you are not satisfied with my apology i will ride with you a few miles into the country and we will then try with equal arms where the chastisement is to fall the norman put his hand to his dagger but there was an ominous growl from some men who had paused to listen to the quarrel you are an insolent boor wulf of steyning and some day i will punish you as you deserve some day the saxon laughed we shall i hope see you and all your tribe sent across the channel there are few of us here who would not see your backs with pleasure what is this an imperious voice demanded and turning round wulf saw william the norman bishop of london who followed by several monks and pages had pushed his way through the crowd walter fitz urse what means this altercation the saxon ran against me of set purpose my lord walter fitz urse said in tones of deep humility and because i complained he challenged me to ride with him into the country to fight and then he said he hoped that some day all the normans would be sent across the channel is this so the prelate said sternly to wulf did you thus insult not only my page but all of us his countrymen i ran against him by accident wulf said looking up fearlessly in the prelate s face i apologized though i know not that i was more in fault than he but instead of taking my apology as one of gentle blood should do he spoke like a churl and threatened me with chastisement and then i did say that i hoped he and all other normans in the land would some day be packed across the channel your ears ought to be slit as an insolent varlet i meant no insolence my lord bishop and as to the slitting of my ears i fancy earl harold my master would have something to say on that score the prelate was about to reply but glancing at the angry faces of the growing crowd he said coldly i shall lay the matter before him come walter enough of this you are also somewhat to blame for not having received more courteously the apologies of this saucy page the crowd fell back with angry mutterings as he turned and followed by walter fitz urse and the ecclesiastics made his way along the street to the principal entrance of the palace without waiting to watch his departure wulf the saxon page pushed his way through the crowd and went off at full speed to carry the message with which he had been charged our king is a good king a squarely built man whose bare arms with the knotted muscles showing through the skin and hands begrimed with charcoal indicated that he was a smith remarked to a gossip as the little crowd broke up but it is a grievous pity that he was brought up a norman still more that he was not left in peace to pass his life as a monk as he desired he fills the land with his normans soon as an english bishop dies straightway a norman is clapped into his place all the offices at court are filled with them and it is seldom a word of honest english is spoken in the palace the norman castles are rising over the land and his favourites divide among them the territory of every english earl or thane who incurs the king s displeasure were it not for earl harold one might as well be under norman sway altogether nay nay neighbour ulred matters are not so bad as that i dare say they would have been as you say had it not been for earl godwin and his sons but it was a great check that godwin gave them when he returned after his banishment and the norman bishops and nobles hurried across the seas in a panic for years now the king has left all matters in the hands of harold and is well content if only he can fast and pray like any monk and give all his thoughts and treasure to the building of yonder abbey we want neither a monk nor a norman over us the smith said roughly still less one who is both norman and monk i would rather have a dane like canute who was a strong man and a firm one than this king who i doubt not is full of good intentions and is a holy and pious monarch but who is not strong enough for a ruler he leaves it to another to preserve england in peace to keep in order the great earls of mercia and the north to hold the land against harold of norway sweyn and others and above all to watch the normans across the water a monk is well enough in a convent but truly tis bad for a country to have a monk as its king there have been some war loving prelates ulred men as ambitious as any of the great earls and more dangerous because they have learning ay there have been great prelates the smith agreed look at lyfing of worcester to whom next only to godwin the king owed his throne he was an englishman first and a bishop afterwards and was a proof if needed that a man can be a great churchman and a great patriot and statesman too it was he rather than godwin who overcame the opposition of the danish party and got the witan at last to acquiesce in the choice of london and wessex and to give their vote to edward well was it he did so for had he failed we should have had as great a struggle in england as when alfred battled against the danes we of london and the men of wessex under the great earl were bent upon being ruled by a prince of our own blood the last two danish kings had shown us that anything is better than being governed by the northmen it was lyfing who persuaded the earl of mercia to side with wessex rather than with northumbria but since lyfing what great englishman have we had in the church every bishopric was granted by edward to norman priests

writes another was the statue of liberty but after all that was only natural it was the first thing that could reach him nor is it only the impressions of the metropolis that seem to fall short of reality let me quote a few others taken at random here and there over the continent i took from pittsburg says an english visitor an impression of something that i could hardly define an atmosphere rather than an idea all very well but after all had he the right to take it granted that pittsburg has an atmosphere rather than an idea the attempt to carry away this atmosphere surely borders on rapacity new orleans writes another visitor opened her arms to me and bestowed upon me the soft and languorous kiss of the caribbean this statement may or may not be true but in any case it hardly seems the fair thing to mention it chicago according to another book of discovery struck me as a large city situated as it is and where it is it seems destined to be a place of importance or here again is a form of impression that recurs again and again at cleveland i felt a distinct note of optimism in the air this same note of optimism is found also at toledo at toronto in short i believe it indicates nothing more than that some one gave the visitor a cigar indeed it generally occurs during the familiar scene in which the visitor describes his cordial reception in an unsuspecting american town thus i was met at the station called in america the depot by a member of the municipal council driving his own motor car after giving me an excellent cigar he proceeded to drive me about the town to various points of interest including the municipal abattoir where he gave me another excellent cigar the carnegie public library the first national bank the courteous manager of which gave me an excellent cigar and the second congregational church where i had the pleasure of meeting the pastor the pastor who appeared a man of breadth and culture gave me another cigar in the evening a dinner admirably cooked and excellently served was tendered to me at a leading hotel and of course he took it after which his statement that he carried away from the town a feeling of optimism explains itself he had four cigars the dinner and half a page of impressions at twenty cents a word nor is it only by the theft of impressions that we suffer at the hands of these english discoverers of america it is a part of the system also that we have to submit to being lectured to by our talented visitors it is now quite understood that as soon as an english literary man finishes a book he is rushed across to america to tell the people of the united states and canada all about it and how he came to write it at home in his own country they don t care how he came to write it he s written it and that s enough but in america it is different one month after the distinguished author s book on the boyhood of botticelli has appeared in london he is seen to land in new york very quietly out of one of the back portholes of the olympic that same afternoon you will find him in an armchair in one of the big hotels giving off impressions of america to a group of reporters after which notices appear in all the papers to the effect that he will lecture in carnegie hall on botticelli the boy the audience is assured beforehand it consists of all the people who feel that they have to go because they know all about botticelli and all the people who feel that they have to go because they don t know anything about botticelli by this means the lecturer is able to rake the whole country from montreal to san francisco with botticelli the boy then he turns round labels his lecture botticelli the man and rakes it all back again all the way across the continent and back he emits impressions estimates of national character and surveys of american genius he sails from new york in a blaze of publicity with his cordon of reporters round him and a month later publishes his book america as i saw it it is widely read in america in the course of time a very considerable public feeling was aroused in the united states and canada over this state of affairs the lack of reciprocity in it seemed unfair it was felt or at least i felt that the time had come when some one ought to go over and take some impressions off england the choice of such a person my choice fell upon myself by an arrangement with the geographical society of america acting in conjunction with the royal geographical society of england to both of whom i communicated my proposal i went at my own expense it is scarcely feasible to give here full details in regard to my outfit and equipment though i hope to do so in a later and more extended account of my expedition suffice it to say that my outfit which was modelled on the equipment of english lecturers in america included a complete suit of clothes a dress shirt for lecturing in a fountain pen and a silk hat the dress shirt i may say for the benefit of other travellers proved invaluable the silk hat however is no longer used in england except perhaps for scrambling eggs in i pass over the details of my pleasant voyage from new york to liverpool

that he had not improved in the slightest degree since their last meeting and sam who imagined that he had long since grown to man s estate and put off childish things was embarrassed to discover that his aunt still affected him as of old that is to say she made him feel as if he had omitted to shave and in addition to that had swallowed some drug which had caused him to swell unpleasantly particularly about the hands and feet jolly morning said sam perseveringly so i imagine i have not yet been out thought i d look in and see how you were that was very kind of you the morning is my busy time but yes that was very kind of you there was another pause how do you like america said sam i dislike it exceedingly yes well of course some people do prohibition and all that personally it doesn t affect me i can take it or leave it alone the reason i dislike america began mrs hignett bridling i like it myself said sam i ve had a wonderful time everybody s treated me like a rich uncle i ve been in detroit you know and they practically gave me the city and asked me if i d like another to take home in my pocket never saw anything like it i might have been the missing heir i think america s the greatest invention on record and what brought you to america said mrs hignett unmoved by this rhapsody oh i came over to play golf in a tournament you know surely at your age said mrs hignett disapprovingly you could be better occupied do you spend your whole time playing golf oh no i hunt a bit and shoot a bit and i swim a good lot and i still play football occasionally i wonder your father does not insist on your doing some useful work he is beginning to harp on the subject rather i suppose i shall take a stab at it sooner or later father says i ought to get married too he is perfectly right i suppose old eustace will be getting hitched up one of these days said sam mrs hignett started violently why do you say that eh what makes you say that oh well he s a romantic sort of fellow writes poetry and all that there is no likelihood at all of eustace marrying he is of a shy and retiring temperament and sees few women he is almost a recluse sam was aware of this and had frequently regretted it he had always been fond of his cousin and in that half amused and rather patronising way in which men of thews and sinews are fond of the weaker brethren who run more to pallor and intellect and he had always felt that if eustace had not had to retire to windles to spend his life with a woman whom from his earliest years he had always considered the empress of the wash outs much might have been made of him both at school and at oxford eustace had been if not a sport at least a decidedly cheery old bean sam remembered eustace at school breaking gas globes with a slipper in a positively rollicking manner he remembered him at oxford playing up to him manfully at the piano on the occasion when he had done that imitation of frank tinney which had been such a hit at the trinity smoker yes eustace had had the makings of a pretty sound egg and it was too bad that he had allowed his mother to coop him up down in the country miles away from anywhere eustace is returning to england on saturday said mrs hignett she spoke a little wistfully she had not been parted from her son since he had come down from oxford and she would have liked to keep him with her till the end of her lecturing tour that however was out of the question it was imperative that while she was away he should be at windles nothing would have induced her to leave the place at the mercy of servants who might trample over the flower beds scratch the polished floors and forget to cover up the canary at night he sails on the atlantic that s splendid said sam i m sailing on the atlantic myself i ll go down to the office and see if we can t have a state room together but where is he going to live when he gets to england where is he going to live why at windles of course where else but i thought you were letting windles for the summer mrs hignett stared letting windles she spoke as one might address a lunatic what put that extraordinary idea into your head i thought father said something about your letting the place to some american nothing of the kind it seemed to sam that his aunt spoke somewhat vehemently even snappishly in correcting what was a perfectly natural mistake he could not know that the subject of letting windles for the summer was one which had long since begun to infuriate mrs hignett people had certainly asked her to let windles in fact people had pestered her there was a rich fat man an american named bennett whom she had met just before sailing at her brother s house in london invited down to windles for the day mr bennett had fallen in love with the place and had begged her to name her own price not content with this he had pursued her with his pleadings by means of the wireless telegraph while she was on the ocean and had not given up the struggle even when she reached new york he had egged on a friend of his a mr mortimer to continue the persecution in that city and this very morning among the letters on mrs hignett s table the buff envelope of a cable from mr bennett had peeped out nearly spoiling her breakfast no wonder then that sam s allusion to the affair had caused the authoress of the spreading light momentarily to lose

was seven years old large for his age a bold handsome lad with red hair mrs smith made a bargain with dick and led him back with her here panhandle took violent exception to having his pets killed or routed out by this boy he had never before seen he did not like his looks anyway but dick paid little heed to panhandle except once when mrs smith went into the house and then he knocked panhandle down for once panhandle did not squall he got up round eyed pale with his hands clenched he never said a word something was born in the depths of his gentle soul then dick tore a hole in the little wall of rocks that supported the porch and with a lighted torch on a stick he wormed his way in to rout out the skunks panhandle suddenly was thrilled and frightened by a bellowing from dick the boy came hurriedly backing out of the hole he fetched an odor with him that nearly suffocated panhandle so strange and raw and terrible was it dick s eyes were shut for the time being he had been blinded he bounced around like a chicken with its head cut off bawling wildly what had happened panhandle did not know but it certainly suited him goody goody he shouted holding his nose and edging away from the lad then panhandle saw smoke issuing from the hole under the porch the mother skunk and her kittens scampered out into the weeds he heard the crackle of flames that boy had dropped his torch under the porch screaming panhandle ran to alarm his mother but it was too late there were no men near at hand so nothing could be done panhandle stood crying beside his mother watching their little home burn to the ground somehow in his mind the boy dick had been to blame panhandle peered round to find him but he was gone never would panhandle forget that boy they walked to the uncle s house and spent the night there soon another home was under construction on the same site it was more of a shack than a house for building materials were scarce and the near approach of winter made hasty construction imperative winter came soon and panhandle and his mother were alone it was cold and they huddled over the little wood fire they had plenty to eat but were very uncomfortable in the one room shack bill smith came home but seldom that fall the valley had been overrun with homesteaders nesters they were called and these newcomers passed by often from the town drunk and rough panhandle used to lie awake a good deal during these lonely hours the moan of the prairie wind the mourn of wolves and yelp of coyotes became part of his existence he understood why his mother barred and blocked the one door placed the ax by the bed and the gun under her pillow even then he longed for the time when he would be old and big enough to protect her the lonely winter with its innumerable hours of solitude for mrs smith and the boy had incalculable influence upon his character she taught him much ways and things words and feelings that became an integral part of his life at last the long winter ended with spring came the gales of wind which though no longer cold were terrible in their violence many a night panhandle lay awake shrinking beside his mother fearing the shack would blow away over their heads many a day the sun was obscured and nothing could be cooked no work done while the dust storm raged as spring advanced with a lessening of the tornadoes a new and fascinating game came into panhandle s life it was to sit at the one little window and watch the cowboys ride by how he came to worship them they were on their way to the spring roundups his father had told him all about them panhandle would strain his eyes to get a first glimpse of them to count the shaggy prancing horses the lithe supple riders with their great sombreros their bright scarfs guns and chaps and boots and spurs their lassos how they fascinated panhandle ropes to whirl and throw at a running steer that was a game he resolved to play when he grew up and his mother discovering his interest made him a little reata and taught him how to throw it how to make loops and knots she told him how her people had owned horses thrown lassos run cattle panhandle was always watching for the cowboys when they passed by he would run to the other side of the shack where there was a knothole stuffed with a rag and through this he would peep until he was blinded by dust these were full days for the lad rousing in him wonder and awe eagerness and fear strange longings for he knew not what then one day his father brought home a black pony with three white feet and a white spot on his face panhandle was in rapture for him he could have burst for very joy but he could not speak it developed that his mother would not let him ride the pony except when she led it this roused as great a grief as possession was joy a beautiful little pony he could not ride ideas formed in his mind scintillated and grew into dark purpose one day he stole curly and led him out of sight behind the barn and mounting him rode down to the spring panhandle found himself alone he was free he was on the back of a horse mighty and incalculable fact curly felt the spirit of that occasion after drinking at the spring he broke into a lope panhandle stuck on somehow and turned the pony toward the house curly loped faster panhandle felt the wind in his hair he bounced up and down squealing with delight he twisted his hands in the flowing mane and held on at the top of the hill his joy became divided by fear curly kept on loping down the hill toward the house faster and faster panhandle bounced higher and higher up on his neck back on his haunches until suddenly his hold broke and he was thrown down

tiny graciousness in short of weeness but compare this new york according to another discoverer of america gave me an impression of size of vastness there seemed to be a big ness about it not found in smaller places a third visitor writes new york struck me as hard cruel almost inhuman this i think was because his taxi driver had charged him three dollars the first thing that struck me in new york writes another was the statue of liberty but after all that was only natural it was the first thing that could reach him nor is it only the impressions of the metropolis that seem to fall short of reality let me quote a few others taken at random here and there over the continent i took from pittsburg says an english visitor an impression of something that i could hardly define an atmosphere rather than an idea all very well but after all had he the right to take it granted that pittsburg has an atmosphere rather than an idea the attempt to carry away this atmosphere surely borders on rapacity new orleans writes another visitor opened her arms to me and bestowed upon me the soft and languorous kiss of the caribbean this statement may or may not be true but in any case it hardly seems the fair thing to mention it chicago according to another book of discovery struck me as a large city situated as it is and where it is it seems destined to be a place of importance or here again is a form of impression that recurs again and again at cleveland i felt a distinct note of optimism in the air this same note of optimism is found also at toledo at toronto in short i believe it indicates nothing more than that some one gave the visitor a cigar indeed it generally occurs during the familiar scene in which the visitor describes his cordial reception in an unsuspecting american town thus i was met at the station called in america the depot by a member of the municipal council driving his own motor car after giving me an excellent cigar he proceeded to drive me about the town to various points of interest including the municipal abattoir where he gave me another excellent cigar the carnegie public library the first national bank the courteous manager of which gave me an excellent cigar and the second congregational church where i had the pleasure of meeting the pastor the pastor who appeared a man of breadth and culture gave me another cigar in the evening a dinner admirably cooked and excellently served was tendered to me at a leading hotel and of course he took it after which his statement that he carried away from the town a feeling of optimism explains itself he had four cigars the dinner and half a page of impressions at twenty cents a word nor is it only by the theft of impressions that we suffer at the hands of these english discoverers of america it is a part of the system also that we have to submit to being lectured to by our talented visitors it is now quite understood that as soon as an english literary man finishes a book he is rushed across to america to tell the people of the united states and canada all about it and how he came to write it at home in his own country they don t care how he came to write it he s written it and that s enough but in america it is different one month after the distinguished author s book on the boyhood of botticelli has appeared in london he is seen to land in new york very quietly out of one of the back portholes of the olympic that same afternoon you will find him in an armchair in one of the big hotels giving off impressions of america to a group of reporters after which notices appear in all the papers to the effect that he will lecture in carnegie hall on botticelli the boy the audience is assured beforehand it consists of all the people who feel that they have to go because they know all about botticelli and all the people who feel that they have to go because they don t know anything about botticelli by this means the lecturer is able to rake the whole country from montreal to san francisco with botticelli the boy then he turns round labels his lecture botticelli the man and rakes it all back again all the way across the continent and back he emits impressions estimates of national character and surveys of american genius he sails from new york in a blaze of publicity with his cordon of reporters round him and a month later publishes his book america as i saw it it is widely read in america in the course of time a very considerable public feeling was aroused in the united states and canada over this state of affairs the lack of reciprocity in it seemed unfair it was felt or at least i felt that the time had come when some one ought to go over and take some impressions off england the choice of such a person my choice fell upon myself by an arrangement with the geographical society of america acting in conjunction with the royal geographical society of england to both of whom i communicated my proposal i went at my own expense it is scarcely feasible to give here full details in regard to my outfit and equipment though i hope to do so in a later and more extended account of my expedition suffice it to say that my outfit which was modelled on the equipment of english lecturers in america included a complete suit of clothes a dress shirt for lecturing in a fountain pen and a silk hat the dress shirt i may say for the benefit of other travellers proved invaluable the silk hat however is no longer used in england except perhaps for scrambling eggs in i pass over the details of my pleasant voyage from new york to liverpool during the last fifty years so many travellers have made the voyage across the atlantic that it is now impossible to obtain any impressions from the ocean of the slightest commercial value

sublimity for them while passing the statue of liberty the spirit of the first man who ever breathed of freedom for the human race burned as a white flame in the heart of lane and his comrade but it was not so much that spirit which held them erect aloof proud it was a supreme consciousness of immeasurable sacrifice for an ideal that existed only in the breasts of men and women kindred to them an unutterable and never to be spoken glory of the duty done for others but that they owed themselves they had sustained immense loss of health and happiness the future seemed like the gray cold gloomy expanse of the river and there could never be any reward except this white fire of their souls nameless but it was the increasing purpose that ran through the ages the ship docked at dark lane left

march automatically put out his hand in one futile gesture as if to catch a falling tea cup in a drawing room for the fraction of a flash it seemed to leave the ledge of rock like a flying ship then the very sky seemed to turn over like a wheel and it lay a ruin amid the tall grasses below a line of gray smoke going up slowly from it into the silent air a little lower the figure of a man with gray hair lay tumbled down the steep green slope his limbs lying all at random and his face turned away the eccentric fisherman dropped his net and walked swiftly toward the spot his new acquaintance following him as they drew near there seemed a sort of monstrous irony in the fact that the dead machine was still throbbing and thundering as busily as a factory while the man lay so still he was unquestionably dead the blood flowed in the grass from a hopelessly fatal fracture at the back of the skull but the face which was turned to the sun was uninjured and strangely arresting in itself it was one of those cases of a strange face so unmistakable as to feel familiar we feel somehow that we ought to recognize it even though we do not it was of the broad square sort with great jaws almost like that of a highly intellectual ape the wide mouth shut so tight as to be traced by a mere line the nose short with the sort of nostrils that seem to gape with an appetite for the air the oddest thing about the face was that one of the eyebrows was cocked up at a much sharper angle than the other march thought he had never seen a face so naturally alive as that dead one and its ugly energy seemed all the stranger for its halo of hoary hair some papers lay half fallen out of the pocket and from among them march extracted a card case he read the name on the card aloud sir humphrey turnbull i m sure i ve heard that name somewhere his companion only gave a sort of a little sigh and was silent for a moment as if ruminating then he merely said the poor fellow is quite gone and added some scientific terms in which his auditor once more found himself out of his depth as things are continued the same curiously well informed person it will be more legal for us to leave the body as it is until the police are informed in fact i think it will be well if nobody except the police is informed don t be surprised if i seem to be keeping it dark from some of our neighbors round here

greatest thing in english history if it fails it will be the most heroic failure in english history are you an admirer of your great kinsman mr fisher rather said mr fisher he s the best shot i know then as if sincerely repentant of his nonchalance he added with a sort of enthusiasm no but really he s a beautiful shot as if fired by his own words he took a sort of leap at the ledges of the rock above him and scaled them with a sudden agility in startling contrast to his general lassitude he had stood for some seconds on the headland above with his aquiline profile under the panama hat relieved against the sky and peering over the countryside before his companion had collected himself sufficiently to scramble up after him the level above was a stretch of common turf on which the tracks of the fated car were plowed plainly enough but the brink of it was broken as with rocky teeth broken boulders of all shapes and sizes lay near the edge it was almost incredible that any one could have deliberately driven into such a death trap especially in broad daylight i can t make head or tail of it said march was he blind or blind drunk neither by the look of him replied the other then it was suicide it doesn t seem a cozy way of doing it remarked the man called fisher besides i don t fancy poor old puggy would commit suicide somehow poor old who inquired the wondering journalist did you know this unfortunate man nobody knew him exactly replied fisher with some vagueness but one knew him of course he d been a terror in his time in parliament and the courts and so on

slightest exotic spirit in the conception or style of that novel it is certainly the most tropical of my eastern tales the mere scenery got a great hold on me as i went on perhaps because i may just as well confess that the story itself was never very near my heart it engaged my imagination much more than my affection as to my feeling for willems it was but the regard one cannot help having for one s own creation obviously i could not be indifferent to a man on whose head i had brought so much evil simply by imagining him such as he appears in the novel and that too on a very slight foundation the man who suggested willems to me was not particularly interesting in himself my interest was aroused by his dependent position his strange dubious status of a mistrusted disliked worn out european living on the reluctant toleration of that settlement hidden in the heart of the forest land up that sombre stream which our ship was the only white men s ship to visit with his hollow clean shaved cheeks a heavy grey moustache and eyes without any expression whatever clad always in a spotless sleeping suit much befrogged in front which left his lean neck wholly uncovered and with his bare feet in a pair of straw slippers he wandered silently amongst the houses in daylight almost as dumb as an animal and apparently much more homeless i don t know what he did with himself at night he must have had a place a hut a palm leaf shed some sort of hovel where he kept his razor and his change of sleeping suits an air of futile mystery hung over him something not exactly dark but obviously ugly the only definite statement i could extract from anybody was that it was he who had brought the arabs into the river that must have happened many years before but how did he bring them into the river he could hardly have done it in his arms like a lot of kittens i knew that almayer founded the chronology of all his misfortunes on the date of that fateful advent and yet the very first time we dined with almayer there was willems sitting at table with us in the manner of the skeleton at the feast obviously shunned by everybody never addressed by any one and for all recognition of his existence getting now and then from almayer a venomous glance which i observed with great surprise in the course of the whole evening he ventured one single remark which i didn t catch because his articulation was imperfect as of a man who had forgotten how to speak i was the only person who seemed aware of the sound willems subsided presently he retired pointedly unnoticed into the forest maybe its immensity was there within three hundred yards of the verandah ready to swallow up anything almayer conversing with my captain did not stop talking while he glared angrily at the retreating back didn t that fellow bring the arabs into the river nevertheless willems turned up next morning on almayer s verandah from the bridge of the steamer i could see plainly these two breakfasting together t te xa t te and i suppose in dead silence one with his air of being no longer interested in this world and the other raising his eyes now and then with intense dislike it was clear that in those days willems lived on almayer s charity yet on returning two months later to sambir i heard that he had gone on an expedition up the river in charge of a steam launch belonging to the arabs to make some discovery or other on account of the strange reluctance that everyone manifested to talk about willems it was impossible for me to get at the rights of that transaction moreover i was a newcomer the youngest of the company and i suspect not judged quite fit as yet for a full confidence i was not much concerned about that exclusion the faint suggestion of plots and mysteries pertaining to all matters touching almayer s affairs amused me vastly almayer was obviously very much affected i believe he missed willems immensely he wore an air of sinister preoccupation and talked confidentially with my captain i could catch only snatches of mumbled sentences then one morning as i came along the deck to take my place at the breakfast table almayer checked himself in his low toned discourse my captain s face was perfectly impenetrable there was a moment of profound silence and then as if unable to contain himself almayer burst out in a loud vicious tone one thing s certain if he finds anything worth having up there they will poison him like a dog disconnected though it was that phrase as food for thought was distinctly worth hearing we left the river three days

too having received a good many knocks at home he kept the hard head out of sight and played at poetry and romance with his literary wife and his sturdy passionate girls he was a man of courage not given to complaining bearing his burdens by himself no he did not let the world intrude far into his home he had a delicate sensitive wife whose poetry won some fame in the narrow world of letters he himself with his tough old barbarian fighting spirit had an almost child like delight in verse in sweet poetry and in the delightful game of a cultured home his blood was strong even to coarseness but that only made the home more vigorous more robust and christmassy there was always a touch of christmas about him now he was well off if there was poetry after dinner there were also chocolates and nuts and good little out of the way things to be munching well then into this family came egbert he was made of quite a different paste the girls and the father were strong limbed thick blooded people true english as holly trees and hawthorn are english their culture was grafted on to them as one might perhaps graft a common pink rose on to a thornstem it flowered oddly enough but it did not alter their blood and egbert was a born rose the age long breeding had left him with a delightful spontaneous passion he was not clever nor even literary no but the intonation of his voice and the movement of his supple handsome body and the fine texture of his flesh and his hair the slight arch of his nose the quickness of his blue eyes would easily take the place of poetry winifred loved him loved him this southerner as a higher being a higher being mind you not a deeper and as for him he loved her in passion with every fibre of him she was the very warm stuff of life to him wonderful then those days at crockham cottage the first days all alone save for the woman who came to work in the mornings marvellous days when she had all his tall supple fine fleshed youth to herself for herself and he had her like a ruddy fire into which he could cast himself for rejuvenation ah that it might never end this passion this marriage the flame of their two bodies burnt again into that old cottage that was haunted already by so much by gone physical desire you could not be in the dark room for an hour without the influences coming over you the hot blood desire of by gone yeomen there in this old den where they had lusted and bred for so many generations the silent house dark with thick timbered walls and the big black chimney place and the sense of secrecy dark with low little windows sunk into the earth dark like a lair where strong beasts had lurked and mated lonely at night and lonely by day left to themselves and their own intensity for so many generations it seemed to cast a spell on the two young people they became different there was a curious secret glow about them a certain slumbering flame hard to understand that enveloped them both they too felt that they did not belong to the london world any more crockham had changed their blood the sense of the snakes that lived and slept even in their own garden in the sun so that he going forward with the spade would see a curious coiled brownish pile on the black soil which suddenly would start up hiss and dazzle rapidly away hissing one day winifred heard the strangest scream from the flower bed under the low window of the living room ah the strangest scream like the very soul of the dark past crying aloud she ran out and saw a long brown snake on the flower bed and in its flat mouth the one hind leg of a frog was striving to escape and screaming its strange tiny bellowing scream she looked at the snake and from its sullen flat head it looked at her obstinately she gave a cry and it released the frog and slid angrily away that was crockham the spear of modern invention had not passed through it and it lay there secret primitive savage as when the saxons first came and egbert and she were caught there caught out of the world he was not idle nor was she there were plenty of things to be done the house to be put into final repair after the workmen had gone cushions and curtains to sew the paths to make the water to fetch and attend to and then the slope of the deep soiled neglected garden to level to terrace with little terraces and paths and to fill with flowers he worked away in his shirt sleeves worked all day intermittently doing this thing and the other and she quiet and rich in herself seeing him stooping and labouring away by himself would come to help him to be near him he of course was an amateur a born amateur he worked so hard and did so little and nothing he ever did would hold together for long if he terraced the garden he held up the earth with a couple of long narrow planks that soon began to bend with the pressure from behind and would not need many years to rot through and break and let the soil slither all down again in a heap towards the stream bed but there you are he had not been brought up to come to grips with anything and he thought it would do nay he did not think there was anything else except little temporary contrivances possible he who had such a passion for his old enduring cottage and for the old enduring things of the bygone england curious that the sense of permanency in the past had such a hold over him whilst in the present he was all amateurish and sketchy winifred could not criticize him town bred everything seemed to her splendid and the very digging and shovelling itself seemed romantic but neither egbert nor she yet

jeeves at any rate for the last five years he has been living at this place of his down in lincolnshire as confirmed a species shunning hermit as ever put fresh water in the tank every second day and refused to see a soul that s why i was so amazed when you told me he had suddenly risen to the surface like this i still can t believe it i am inclined to think that there must be some mistake and that this bird who has been calling here is some different variety of fink nottle the chap i know wears horn rimmed spectacles and has a face like a fish how does that check up with your data the gentleman who came to the flat wore horn rimmed spectacles sir and looked like something on a slab possibly there was a certain suggestion of the piscine sir then it must be gussie i suppose but what on earth can have brought him up to london i am in a position to explain that sir mr fink nottle confided to me his motive in visiting the metropolis he came because the young lady is here young lady yes sir you don t mean he s in love yes sir well i m dashed i m really dashed i positively am dashed jeeves and i was too i mean to say a joke s a joke but there are limits then i found my mind turning to another aspect of this rummy affair conceding the fact that gussie fink nottle against all the ruling of the form book might have fallen in love why should he have been haunting my flat like this no doubt the occasion was one of those when a fellow needs a friend but i couldn t see what had made him pick on me it wasn t as if he and i were in any way bosom we had seen a lot of each other at one time of course but in the last two years i hadn t had so much as a post card from him i put all this to jeeves odd his coming to me still if he did he did no argument about that it must have been a nasty jar for the poor perisher when he found i wasn t here no sir mr fink nottle did not call to see you sir pull yourself together jeeves you ve just told me that this is what he has been doing and assiduously at that it was i with whom he was desirous of establishing communication sir you but i didn t know you had ever met him i had not had that pleasure until he called here sir but it appears that mr sipperley a fellow student of whom mr fink nottle had been at the university recommended him to place his affairs in my hands the mystery had conked i saw all as i dare say you know jeeves s reputation as a counsellor has long been established among the cognoscenti and the first move of any of my little circle on discovering themselves in any form of soup is always to roll round and put the thing up to him and when he s got a out of a bad spot a puts b on to him and then when he has fixed up b b sends c along and so on if you get my drift and so forth that s how these big consulting practices like jeeves s grow old sippy i knew had been deeply impressed by the man s efforts on his behalf at the time when he was trying to get engaged to elizabeth moon so it was not to be wondered at that he should have advised gussie to apply pure routine you might say oh you re acting for him are you yes sir now i follow now i understand and what is gussie s trouble oddly enough sir precisely the same as that of mr sipperley when i was enabled to be of assistance to him no doubt you recall mr sipperley s predicament sir deeply attached to miss moon he suffered from a rooted diffidence which made it impossible for him to speak i nodded i remember yes i recall the sipperley case he couldn t bring himself to the scratch a marked coldness of the feet was there not i recollect you saying he was letting what was it letting something do something cats entered into it if i am not mistaken letting i dare not wait upon i would sir that s right but how about the cats like the poor cat i the adage sir exactly it beats me how you think up these things and gussie you say is in the same posish yes sir each time he endeavours to formulate a proposal of marriage his courage fails him and yet if he wants this female to be his wife he s got to say so what i mean only civil to mention it precisely sir i mused well i suppose this was inevitable jeeves i wouldn t have thought that this fink nottle would ever have fallen a victim to the divine p but if he has no wonder he finds the going sticky yes sir look at the life he s led yes sir i don t suppose he has spoken to a girl for years what a lesson this is to us jeeves not to shut ourselves up in country houses and stare into glass tanks you can t be the dominant male if you do that sort of thing in this life you can choose between two courses you can either shut yourself up in a country house and stare into tanks or you can be a dasher with the sex you can t do both no sir i mused once more gussie and i as i say had rather lost touch but all the same i was exercised about the poor fish as i am about all my pals close or distant who find themselves treading upon life s banana skins it seemed to me that he was up against it i threw my mind back to the last time i had seen him about two years ago it had been i had looked in at his place while on a motor trip and he had put me right off my feed by

of an evening to watch the sun set over the sea of yellow corn and the high green elms beyond which divide the cornfields from the maidenhead thicket an old agricultural labourer he had a grey face and grey hair and throat beard he stooped a good deal and struck me as being very feeble and long past work but he told me that he still did some work in the fields the older farmers who had employed him for many years past gave him a little to do he also had his old age pension and his children helped to keep him in comfort he was quite well off he said compared to many there was a subdued and sombre cheerfulness in him and when i questioned him about his early life he talked very freely in his slow old peasant way he was born in a village in the vale of aylesbury and began work as a ploughboy on a very big farm he had a good master and was well fed the food being bacon vegetables and homemade bread also suet pudding three times a week but what he remembered best was a rice pudding which came by chance in his way during his first year on the farm there was some of the pudding left in a dish after the family had dined and the farmer said to his wife give it to the boy so he had it and never tasted anything so nice in all his life how he enjoyed that pudding he remembered it now as if it had been yesterday though it was sixty five years ago he then went on to talk of the changes that had been going on in the world since that happy time but the greatest change of all was in the appearance of things he had had a hard life and the hardest time was when he was a ploughboy and had to work so hard that he was tired to death at the end of every day yet at four o clock in the morning he was ready and glad to get up and go out to work all day again because everything looked so bright and it made him happy just to look up at the sky and listen to the birds in those days there were larks the number of larks was wonderful the sound of their singing filled the whole air he didn t want any greater happiness than to hear them singing over his head a few days ago not more than half a mile from where we were standing he was crossing a field when a lark got up singing near him and went singing over his head he stopped to listen and said to himself well now that do remind me of old times for you know he went on it is a rare thing to hear a lark now what s become of all the birds i used to see i don t know i remember there was a very pretty bird at that time called the yellow hammer a bird all a shining yellow the prettiest of all the birds he never saw nor heard that bird now he assured me that was how the old man talked and i never told him that yellow hammers could be seen and heard all day long anywhere on the common beyond the green wall of the elms and that a lark was singing loudly high up over our heads while he was talking of the larks he had listened to sixty five years ago in the vale of aylesbury and saying that it was a rare thing to hear that bird now iii as a tree falls at the green dragon where i refreshed myself at noon with bread and cheese and beer i was startlingly reminded of a simple and i suppose familiar psychological fact yet one which we are never conscious of except at rare moments when by chance it is thrust upon us there are many green dragons in this world of wayside inns even as there are many white harts red lions silent women and other incredible things but when i add that my inn is in a wiltshire village the headquarters of certain gentlemen who follow a form of sport which has long been practically obsolete in this country and indeed throughout the civilised world some of my readers will have no difficulty in identifying it after lunching i had an hour s pleasant conversation with the genial landlord and his buxom good looking wife they were both natives of a new forest village and glad to talk about it with one who knew it intimately during our talk i happened to use the words i forget what about as a tree falls so must it lie the landlady turned on me her dark hampshire eyes with a sudden startled and pained look in them and cried oh please don t say that why not i asked it is in the bible and a quite common saying i know she returned but i can t bear it i hate to hear it she would say no more but my curiosity was stirred and i set about persuading her to tell me ah yes i said i can guess why it s something in your past life a sad story of one of your family one very much loved perhaps who got into trouble and was refused all help from those who might have saved him no she said it all happened before my time long before i never knew her and then presently she told me the story when her father was a young man he lived and worked with his father a farmer in hampshire and a widower there were several brothers and sisters and one of the sisters named eunice was most loved by all of them and was her father s favourite on account of her beauty and sweet disposition unfortunately she became engaged to a young man who was not liked by the father and when she refused to break her engagement to please him he was dreadfully angry and told her that if she went against him and threw herself away on that worthless fellow he would forbid her the house and would never see or speak to her again being of an affectionate disposition and fond of her father it grieved her sorely to disobey him but her love compelled her and by and by she went away and was married in a neighbouring village where her lover had his home it was not a happy marriage and after a few anxious

and much better looking i must say that in a struggle i shouldn t know which to back wingate has sentiment and phipps has none conscience of which phipps hasn t a shred and a sense of honour with which phipps was certainly never troubled these points are all against him in a market duel but on the other hand he has a bigger outlook than phipps he has nerves of steel and the grit of a hero did i tell you by the by that he went into the war as a private and came out a brigadier splendid sarah murmured now tell us where peter phipps comes in well kendrick continued phipps attracts sympathy because of his lavish hospitality and apparent generosity whilst wingate is a man of many reserves and has few friends either on this side or the other then phipps i should say is the wealthier man and in this present deal at any rate he has marvellous support so that financially he must tower over wingate then too i think he understands the tricks of the market better over here and he has a very dangerous confederate in skinflint martin what that old blackguard doesn t know of chicanery and crooked dealing the devil himself couldn t make use of if he s put his own money into b i i should say that phipps can t be broken my advice to wingate at any rate when we meet will be to stand by for a time the sound of approaching voices warned them that their seclusion was on the point of being broken into their hostess an elderly lady of great social gifts and immense volubility appeared having for her escort a tall well groomed man of youthful middle age with the square jaw and humorous gleam in his grey eyes of the best trans atlantic type lady amesbury beamed upon them all just the people i was looking for she exclaimed i want you all to know my great friend mr wingate from new york every one was glad to meet wingate and kendrick and he exchanged the greetings of old friends now you have found some one whom you can talk to my dear john his hostess declared i shall consider you off my hands for the afternoon come and dine with me next sunday night and don t lose your heart to sarah baldwin she s a capricious little minx and besides she s engaged to jimmy there though heaven knows whether they ll ever get married there i knew it my own particular bishop being lured into conversation with hilda sutton who s just become a freethinker and can t talk of anything else it will spoil the dear man s afternoon if she gets really started good by all of you take care of mr wingate she hurried off and the newcomer seated himself between kendrick and sarah we ve just been hearing all about you mr wingate sarah began but i must say you re the last person we expected to see here we imagined you dashing in a great motor car from liverpool to your office in the city dictating letters speaking into the telephone and doing all sorts of violent things i don t believe mr kendrick told us the truth about you at all wingate smiled good humouredly tell me what kendrick has been saying and i will let you know whether it is the truth or not he promised well he has just given us a thrilling picture of you she went on coming over here armed cap a pie to do battle for the romance of money already we were picturing to ourselves poor dreadnought phipps the first of your

too having received a good many knocks at home he kept the hard head out of sight and played at poetry and romance with his literary wife and his sturdy passionate girls he was a man of courage not given to complaining bearing his burdens by himself no he did not let the world intrude far into his home he had a delicate sensitive wife whose poetry won some fame in the narrow world of letters he himself with his tough old barbarian fighting spirit had an almost child like delight in verse in sweet poetry and in the delightful game of a cultured home his blood was strong even to coarseness but that only made the home more vigorous more robust and christmassy there was always a touch of christmas about him now he was well off if there was poetry after dinner there were also chocolates and nuts and good little out of the way things to be munching well then into this family came egbert he was made of quite a different paste the girls and the father were strong limbed thick blooded people true english as holly trees and hawthorn are english their culture was grafted on to them as one might perhaps graft a common pink rose on to a thornstem it flowered oddly enough but it did not alter their blood and egbert was a born rose the age long breeding had left him with a delightful spontaneous passion he was not clever nor even literary no but the intonation of his voice and the movement of his supple handsome body and the fine texture of his flesh and his hair the slight arch of his nose the quickness of his blue eyes would easily take the place of poetry winifred loved him loved him this southerner as a higher being a higher being mind you not a deeper and as for him he loved her in passion with every fibre of him she was the very warm stuff of life to him wonderful then those days at crockham cottage the first days all alone save for the woman who came to work in the mornings marvellous days when she had all his tall supple fine fleshed youth to herself for herself and he had her like a ruddy fire into which he could cast himself for rejuvenation ah that it might never end this passion this marriage the flame of their two bodies burnt again into that old cottage that was haunted already by so much by gone physical desire you could not be in the dark room for an hour without the influences coming over you the hot blood desire of by gone yeomen there in this old den where they had lusted and bred for so many generations the silent house dark with thick timbered walls and the big black chimney place and the sense of secrecy dark with low little windows sunk into the earth dark like a lair where strong beasts had lurked and mated lonely at night and lonely by day left to themselves and their own intensity for so many generations it seemed to cast a spell on the two young people they became different there was a curious secret glow about them a certain slumbering flame hard to understand that enveloped them both they too felt that they did not belong to the london world any more crockham had changed their blood the sense of the snakes that lived and slept even in their own garden in the sun so that he going forward with the spade would see a curious coiled brownish pile on the black soil which suddenly would start up hiss and dazzle rapidly away hissing one day winifred heard the strangest scream from the flower bed under the low window of the living room ah the strangest scream like the very soul of the dark past crying aloud she ran out and saw a long brown snake on the flower bed and in its flat mouth the one hind leg of a frog was striving to escape and screaming its strange tiny bellowing scream she looked at the snake and from its sullen flat head it looked at her obstinately she gave a cry and it released the frog and slid angrily away that was crockham the spear of modern invention had not passed through it and it lay there secret primitive savage as when the saxons first came and egbert and she were caught there caught out of the world he was not idle nor was she there were plenty of things to be done the house to be put into final repair after the workmen had gone cushions and curtains to sew the paths to make the water to fetch and attend to and then the slope of the deep soiled neglected garden to level to terrace with little terraces and paths and to fill with flowers he worked away in his shirt sleeves worked all day intermittently doing this thing and the other and she quiet and rich in herself seeing him stooping and labouring away by himself would come to help him to be near him he of course was an amateur a born amateur he worked so hard and did so little and nothing he ever did would hold together for long if he terraced the garden he held up the earth with a couple of long narrow planks that soon began to bend with the pressure from behind and would not need many years to rot through and break and let the soil slither all down again in a heap towards the stream bed but there you are he had not been brought up to come to grips with anything and he thought it would do nay he did not think there was anything else except little temporary contrivances possible he who had such a passion for his old enduring cottage and for the old enduring things of the bygone england curious that the sense of permanency in the past had such a hold over him whilst in the present he was all amateurish and sketchy winifred could not criticize him town bred everything seemed to her splendid and the very digging and shovelling itself seemed romantic but neither egbert nor she yet

willing to be his slave he listens with deep attention she explains that since her father s death she has been continuously persecuted by the village people on the double count of her italian blood and her poverty the girl invites him to come to her hut in the forest and verify what she says with a gesture he signifies that he will follow where she leads she rises the crowd gathers round all are

effort any straining for effect any of that double double toil and trouble by which many even of the weird cauldrons in which genius forms her creations are disturbed and bedimmed that power of doing everything with perfect and conscious ease which dugald stewart has ascribed to barrow and to horsley in prose distinguished dryden in poetry whether he discusses the deep questions of fate and foreknowledge in religio laici or lashes shaftesbury in the medal or pours a torrent of contempt on shadwell in macflecknoe or describes the fire of london in the annus mirabilis or soars into lyric enthusiasm in his ode on the death of mrs killigrew and alexander s feast or paints a tournament in palamon and arcite or a fairy dance in the flower and the leaf he is always at home and always aware that he is his consciousness of his own powers amounts to exultation he is like the steed who glories in that tremendous gallop which affects the spectator with fear indeed we never can separate our conception of dryden s vigorous and vaulting style from the image of a noble horse devouring the dust of the field clearing obstacles at a bound taking up long leagues as a little thing and the very strength and speed of whose motion give it at a distance the appearance of smoothness pope speaks of his long resounding march and energy divine perhaps ease divine had been words more characteristic of that almost superhuman power of language by which he makes the most obstinate materials pliant melts down difficulties as if by the touch of magic and to resume the former figure comes into the goal without a hair turned on his mane or a single sweat drop confessing effort or extraordinary exertion we know no poet since homer who can be compared to dryden in this respect except scott who occasionally in marmion and the lay of the last minstrel exhibits the same impetuous ease and fiery fluent movement scott does not however in general carry the same weight as the other and the species of verse he uses in comparison to the heroic rhyme of dryden gives you often the impression of a hard trot rather than of a long resounding and magnificent gallop scott exhibits in his poetry the soul of a warrior but it is of a warrior of the border somewhat savage and coarse dryden can for the nonce at least assume the appearance and display the spirit of a knight of ancient chivalry gallant accomplished elegant and gay next to this poet s astonishing ease spirit and elastic vigour may be ranked his clear sharp intellect he may be called more a logician than a poet he reasons often and always acutely and his rhyme instead of shackling strengthens the movement of his argumentation parts of his religio laici and the hind and panther resemble portions of duns scotus or aquinas set on fire indeed keen strong intellect inflamed with passion and inspirited by that ardour and impetuosity of mind which wordsworth is compelled to allow to him rather than creative or original genius is the differentia of dryden we have compared him to a courser but he was not one of those coursers of achilles who fed on no earthly food but on the golden barley of heaven having sprung from the gods greek xanthon kai balion to ama pnoiaesi petesthaen tous eteke zephuro anemo arpua podargae dryden resembled rather the mortal steed which was yoked with these immortal twain the brood of zephyr and the harpy podarga only we can hardly say of the poet what homer says of pedasus greek os kai thnaetos eon epeth ippois athanatoisi he was not although a mortal able to keep up with the immortal coursers his path was on the plains or table lands of earth never or seldom in cloudland gorgeous land or through the aerial altitudes which stretch away and above the clouds to the gates of heaven he can hardly be said to have possessed the power of sublimity in the high sense of that term as the power of sympathising with the feeling of the infinite often he gives us the impression of the picturesque of the beautiful of the heroic of the nobly disdainful but never when writing at least entirely from his own mind of that infinite and nameless grandeur which the imaginative soul feels shed on it from the multitudinous waves of ocean from the cataract leaping from his rock as if to consummate an act of prayer to god from the hum of great assemblies of men from the sight of far extended wastes and wildernesses and from the awful silence and the still more mysterious sparkle of the midnight stars this sense of the presence of the shadow of immensity immensity itself cannot be felt any more than measured this sight like that vouchsafed to moses of the backparts of the divine the divine itself cannot be seen has been the inspiration of all the highest poetry of the world of the paradise lost of the divina commedia of the night thoughts of wordsworth and coleridge of festus and highest far of the hebrew prophets as they cry whither can we go from thy presence whither can we flee from thy spirit such poets have resembled a blind man who feels although he cannot see that a stranger of commanding air is in the room beside him so they stand awe struck in the wind of the going of a majestic and unseen being this feeling differs from mysticism inasmuch as it is connected with a reality while the mystic dreams a vague and unsupported dream and the poetry it produces is simply the irresistible cry springing from the perception of this wondrous some one who is actually near them the feeling is connected in general with a lofty moral and religious nature and yet not always since while wanting in dryden we find it intensely discovered although in an imperfect and perverted shape in by

with his father and grandfather that charles the second was not content with saying witty things about his philosophers but did wise things with regard to them for he not only bestowed upon them such attention as he could spare from his poodles and his mistresses but being in his usual state of impecuniosity begged for them of the duke of ormond and that step being without effect gave them chelsea college a charter and a mace crowning his favours in the best way they could be crowned by burdening them no further with royal patronage or state interference thus it was that the half dozen young men studious of the new philosophy who met in one another s lodgings in oxford or in london in the middle of the seventeenth century grew in numerical and in real strength until in the latter part the royal society for the improvement of natural knowledge had already become famous and had acquired a claim upon the veneration of englishmen which it has ever since retained as the principal focus of scientific activity in our islands and the chief champion of the cause it was formed to support it was by the aid of the royal society that newton published his principia if all the books in the world except the philosophical transactions were destroyed it is safe to say that the foundations of physical science would remain unshaken and that the vast intellectual progress of the last two centuries would be largely though incompletely recorded nor have any signs of halting or of decrepitude manifested themselves in our own times as in dr wallis s days so in these our business is precluding theology and state affairs to discourse and consider of philosophical enquiries but our mathematick is one which newton would have to go to school to learn our staticks mechanicks magneticks chymicks and natural experiments constitute a mass of physical and chemical knowledge a glimpse at which would compensate galileo for the doings of a score of inquisitorial cardinals our physick and anatomy have embraced such infinite varieties of being have laid open such new worlds in time and space have grappled not unsuccessfully with such complex problems that the eyes of vesalius and of harvey might be dazzled by the sight of the tree that has grown out of their grain of mustard seed the fact is perhaps rather too much than too little forced upon one s notice nowadays that all this marvellous intellectual growth has a no less wonderful expression in practical life and that in this respect if in no other the movement symbolized by the progress of the royal society stands without a parallel in the history of mankind a series of volumes as bulky as the transactions of the royal society might possibly be filled with the subtle speculations of the schoolmen not improbably the obtaining a mastery over the products of mediaeval thought might necessitate an even greater expenditure of time and of energy than the acquirement of the new philosophy but though such work engrossed the best intellects of europe for a longer time than has elapsed since the great fire its effects were writ in water so far as our social state is concerned on the other hand if the noble first president of the royal society could revisit the upper air and once more gladden his eyes with a sight of the familiar mace he would find himself in the midst of a material civilization more different from that of his day than that of the seventeenth was from that of the first century and if lord brouncker s native sagacity had not deserted his ghost he would need no long reflection to discover that all these great ships these railways these telegraphs these factories these printing presses without which the whole fabric of modern english society would collapse into a mass of stagnant and starving pauperism that all these pillars of our state are but the ripples and the bubbles upon the surface of that great spiritual stream the springs of which only he and his fellows were privileged to see and seeing to recognise as that which it behoved them above all things to keep pure and undefiled it may not be too great a flight of imagination to conceive our noble revenant not forgetful of the great troubles of his own day and anxious to know how often london had been burned down since his time and how often the plague had carried off its thousands he would have to learn that although london contains tenfold the inflammable matter that it did in though not content with filling our rooms with woodwork and light draperies we must needs lead inflammable and explosive gases into every corner of our streets and houses we never allow even a street to burn down and if he asked how this had come about we should have to explain that the improvement of natural knowledge has furnished us with dozens of machines for throwing water upon fires any one of which would have furnished the ingenious mr hooke the first curator and experimenter of the royal society with ample materials for discourse before half a dozen meetings of that body and that to say truth except for the progress of natural knowledge we should not have been able to make even the tools by which these machines are constructed and further it would be necessary to add that although severe fires sometimes occur and inflict great damage the loss is very generally compensated by societies the operations of which have been rendered possible only by the progress of natural knowledge in the direction of mathematics and the accumulation of wealth in virtue of other natural knowledge but the plague my lord brouncker s observation would not i fear lead him to think that englishmen of the nineteenth century are purer in life or more fervent in religious faith than the generation which could produce a

effort any straining for effect any of that double double toil and trouble by which many even of the weird cauldrons in which genius forms her creations are disturbed and bedimmed that power of doing everything with perfect and conscious ease which dugald stewart has ascribed to barrow and to horsley in prose distinguished dryden in poetry whether he discusses the deep questions of fate and foreknowledge in religio laici or lashes shaftesbury in the medal or pours a torrent of contempt on shadwell in macflecknoe or describes the fire of london in the annus mirabilis or soars into lyric enthusiasm in his ode on the death of mrs killigrew and alexander s feast or paints a tournament in palamon and arcite or a fairy dance in the flower and the leaf he is always at home and always aware that he is his consciousness of his own powers amounts to exultation he is like the steed who glories in that tremendous gallop which affects the spectator with fear indeed we never can separate our conception of dryden s vigorous and vaulting style from the image of a noble horse devouring the dust of the field clearing obstacles at a bound taking up long leagues as a little thing and the very strength and speed of whose motion give it at a distance the appearance of smoothness pope speaks of his long resounding march and energy divine perhaps ease divine had been words more characteristic of that almost superhuman power of language by which he makes the most obstinate materials pliant melts down difficulties as if by the touch of magic and to resume the former figure comes into the goal without a hair turned on his mane or a single sweat drop confessing effort or extraordinary exertion we know no poet since homer who can be compared to dryden in this respect except scott who occasionally in marmion and the lay of the last minstrel exhibits the same impetuous ease and fiery fluent movement scott does not however in general carry the same weight as the other and the species of verse he uses in comparison to the heroic rhyme of dryden gives you often the impression of a hard trot rather than of a long resounding and magnificent gallop scott exhibits in his poetry the soul of a warrior but it is of a warrior of the border somewhat savage and coarse dryden can for the nonce at least assume the appearance and display the spirit of a knight of ancient chivalry gallant accomplished elegant and gay next to this poet s astonishing ease spirit and elastic vigour may be ranked his clear sharp intellect he may be called more a logician than a poet he reasons often and always acutely and his rhyme instead of shackling strengthens the movement of his argumentation parts of his religio laici and the hind and panther resemble portions of duns scotus or aquinas set on fire indeed keen strong intellect inflamed with passion and inspirited by that ardour and impetuosity of mind which wordsworth is compelled to allow to him rather than creative or original genius is the differentia of dryden we have compared him to a courser but he was not one of those coursers of achilles who fed on no earthly food but on the golden barley of heaven having sprung from the gods greek xanthon kai balion to ama pnoiaesi petesthaen tous eteke zephuro anemo arpua podargae dryden resembled rather the mortal steed which was yoked with these immortal twain the brood of zephyr and the harpy podarga only we can hardly say of the poet what homer says of pedasus greek os kai thnaetos eon epeth ippois athanatoisi he was not although a mortal able to keep up with the immortal coursers his path was on the plains or table lands of earth never or seldom in cloudland gorgeous land or through the aerial altitudes which stretch away and above the clouds to the gates of heaven he can hardly be said to have possessed the power of sublimity in the high sense of that term as the power of sympathising with the feeling of the infinite often he gives us the impression of the picturesque of the beautiful of the heroic of the nobly disdainful but never when writing at least entirely from his own mind of that infinite and nameless grandeur which the imaginative soul feels shed on it from the multitudinous waves of ocean from the cataract leaping from his rock as if to consummate an act of prayer to god from the hum of great assemblies of men from the sight of far extended wastes and wildernesses and from the awful silence and the still more mysterious sparkle of the midnight stars this sense of the presence of the shadow of immensity immensity itself cannot be felt any more than measured this sight like that vouchsafed to moses of the backparts of the divine the divine itself cannot be seen has been the inspiration of all the highest poetry of the world of the paradise lost of the divina commedia of the night thoughts of wordsworth and coleridge of festus and highest far of the hebrew prophets as they cry whither can we go from thy presence whither can we flee from thy spirit such poets have resembled a blind man who feels although he cannot see that a stranger of commanding air is in the room beside him so they stand awe struck in the wind of the going of a majestic and unseen being this feeling differs from mysticism inasmuch as it is connected with a reality while the mystic dreams a vague and unsupported dream and the poetry it produces is simply the irresistible cry springing from the perception of this wondrous some one who is actually near them the feeling is connected in general with a lofty moral and religious nature and yet not always since while wanting in dryden we find it intensely discovered although in an imperfect and perverted shape in by

everything with perfect and conscious ease which dugald stewart has ascribed to barrow and to horsley in prose distinguished dryden in poetry whether he discusses the deep questions of fate and foreknowledge in religio laici or lashes shaftesbury in the medal or pours a torrent of contempt on shadwell in macflecknoe or describes the fire of london in the annus mirabilis or soars into lyric enthusiasm in his ode on the death of mrs killigrew and alexander s feast or paints a tournament in palamon and arcite or a fairy dance in the flower and the leaf he is always at home and always aware that he is his consciousness of his own powers amounts to exultation he is like the steed who glories in that tremendous gallop which affects the spectator with fear indeed we never can separate our conception of dryden s vigorous and vaulting style from the image of a noble horse devouring the dust of the field clearing obstacles at a bound taking up long leagues as a little thing and the very strength and speed of whose motion give it at a distance the appearance of smoothness pope speaks of his long resounding march and energy divine perhaps ease divine had been words more characteristic of that almost superhuman power of language by which he makes the most obstinate materials pliant melts down difficulties as if by the touch of magic and to resume the former figure comes into the goal without a hair turned on his mane or a single sweat drop confessing effort or extraordinary exertion we know no poet since homer who can be compared to dryden in this respect except scott who occasionally in marmion and the lay of the last minstrel exhibits the same impetuous ease and fiery fluent movement scott does not however in general carry the same weight as the other and the species of verse he uses in comparison to the heroic rhyme of dryden gives you often the impression of a hard trot rather than of a long resounding and magnificent gallop scott exhibits in his poetry the soul of a warrior but it is of a warrior of the border somewhat savage and coarse dryden can for the nonce at least assume the appearance and display the spirit of a knight of ancient chivalry gallant accomplished elegant and gay next to this poet s astonishing ease spirit and elastic vigour may be ranked his clear sharp intellect he may be called more a logician than a poet he reasons often and always acutely and his rhyme instead of shackling strengthens the movement of his argumentation parts of his religio laici and the hind and panther resemble portions of duns scotus or aquinas set on fire indeed keen strong intellect inflamed with passion and inspirited by that ardour and impetuosity of mind which wordsworth is compelled to allow to him rather than creative or original genius is the differentia of dryden we have compared him to a courser but he was not one of those coursers of achilles who fed on no earthly food but on the golden barley of heaven having sprung from the gods greek xanthon kai balion to ama pnoiaesi petesthaen tous eteke zephuro anemo arpua podargae dryden resembled rather the mortal steed which was yoked with these immortal twain the brood of zephyr and the harpy podarga only we can hardly say of the poet what homer says of pedasus greek os kai thnaetos eon epeth ippois athanatoisi he was not although a mortal able to keep up with the immortal coursers his path was on the plains or table lands of earth never or seldom in cloudland gorgeous land or through the aerial altitudes which stretch away and above the clouds to the gates of heaven he can hardly be said to have possessed the power of sublimity in the high sense of that term as the power of sympathising with the feeling of the infinite often he gives us the impression of the picturesque of the beautiful of the heroic of the nobly disdainful but never when writing at least entirely from his own mind of that infinite and nameless grandeur which the imaginative soul feels shed on it from the multitudinous waves of ocean from the cataract leaping from his rock as if to consummate an act of prayer to god from the hum of great assemblies of men from the sight of far extended wastes and wildernesses and from the awful silence and the still more mysterious sparkle of the midnight stars this sense of the presence of the shadow of immensity immensity itself cannot be felt any more than measured this sight like that vouchsafed to moses of the backparts of the divine the divine itself cannot be seen has been the inspiration of all the highest poetry of the world of the paradise lost of the divina commedia of the night thoughts of wordsworth and coleridge of festus and highest far of the hebrew prophets as they cry whither can we go from thy presence whither can we flee from thy spirit such poets have resembled a blind man who feels although he cannot see that a stranger of commanding air is in the room beside him so they stand awe struck in the wind of the going of a majestic and unseen being this feeling differs from mysticism inasmuch as it is connected with a reality while the mystic dreams a vague and unsupported dream and the poetry it produces is simply the irresistible cry springing from the perception of this wondrous some one who is actually near them the feeling is connected in general with a lofty moral and religious nature and yet not always since while wanting in dryden we find it intensely discovered although in an imperfect and perverted shape in by

effort any straining for effect any of that double double toil and trouble by which many even of the weird cauldrons in which genius forms her creations are disturbed and bedimmed that power of doing everything with perfect and conscious ease which dugald stewart has ascribed to barrow and to horsley in prose distinguished dryden in poetry whether he discusses the deep questions of fate and foreknowledge in religio laici or lashes shaftesbury in the medal or pours a torrent of contempt on shadwell in macflecknoe or describes the fire of london in the annus mirabilis or soars into lyric enthusiasm in his ode on the death of mrs killigrew and alexander s feast or paints a tournament in palamon and arcite or a fairy dance in the flower and the leaf he is always at home and always aware that he is his consciousness of his own powers amounts to exultation he is like the steed who glories in that tremendous gallop which affects the spectator with fear indeed we never can separate our conception of dryden s vigorous and vaulting style from the image of a noble horse devouring the dust of the field clearing obstacles at a bound taking up long leagues as a little thing and the very strength and speed of whose motion give it at a distance the appearance of smoothness pope speaks of his long resounding march and energy divine perhaps ease divine had been words more characteristic of that almost superhuman power of language by which he makes the most obstinate materials pliant melts down difficulties as if by the touch of magic and to resume the former figure comes into the goal without a hair turned on his mane or a single sweat drop confessing effort or extraordinary exertion we know no poet since homer who can be compared to dryden in this respect except scott who occasionally in marmion and the lay of the last minstrel exhibits the same impetuous ease and fiery fluent movement scott does not however in general carry the same weight as the other and the species of verse he uses in comparison to the heroic rhyme of dryden gives you often the impression of a hard trot rather than of a long resounding and magnificent gallop scott exhibits in his poetry the soul of a warrior but it is of a warrior of the border somewhat savage and coarse dryden can for the nonce at least assume the appearance and display the spirit of a knight of ancient chivalry gallant accomplished elegant and gay next to this poet s astonishing ease spirit and elastic vigour may be ranked his clear sharp intellect he may be called more a logician than a poet he reasons often and always acutely and his rhyme instead of shackling strengthens the movement of his argumentation parts of his religio laici and the hind and panther resemble portions of duns scotus or aquinas set on fire indeed keen strong intellect inflamed with passion and inspirited by that ardour and impetuosity of mind which wordsworth is compelled to allow to him rather than creative or original genius is the differentia of dryden we have compared him to a courser but he was not one of those coursers of achilles who fed on no earthly food but on the golden barley of heaven having sprung from the gods greek xanthon kai balion to ama pnoiaesi petesthaen tous eteke zephuro anemo arpua podargae dryden resembled rather the mortal steed which was yoked with these immortal twain the brood of zephyr and the harpy podarga only we can hardly say of the poet what homer says of pedasus greek os kai thnaetos eon epeth ippois athanatoisi he was not although a mortal able to keep up with the immortal coursers his path was on the plains or table lands of earth never or seldom in cloudland gorgeous land or through the aerial altitudes which stretch away and above the clouds to the gates of heaven he can hardly be said to have possessed the power of sublimity in the high sense of that term as the power of sympathising with the feeling of the infinite often he gives us the impression of the picturesque of the beautiful of the heroic of the nobly disdainful but never when writing at least entirely from his own mind of that infinite and nameless grandeur which the imaginative soul feels shed on it from the multitudinous waves of ocean from the cataract leaping from his rock as if to consummate an act of prayer to god from the hum of great assemblies of men from the sight of far extended wastes and wildernesses and from the awful silence and the still more mysterious sparkle of the midnight stars this sense of the presence of the shadow of immensity immensity itself cannot be felt any more than measured this sight like that vouchsafed to moses of the backparts of the divine the divine itself cannot be seen has been the inspiration of all the highest poetry of the world of the paradise lost of the divina commedia of the night thoughts of wordsworth and coleridge of festus and highest far of the hebrew prophets as they cry whither can we go from thy presence whither can we flee from thy spirit such poets have resembled a blind man who feels although he cannot see that a stranger of commanding air is in the room beside him so they stand awe struck in the wind of the going of a majestic and unseen being this feeling differs from mysticism inasmuch as it is connected with a reality while the mystic dreams a vague and unsupported dream and the poetry it produces is simply the irresistible cry springing from the perception of this wondrous some one who is actually near them the feeling is connected in general with a lofty moral and religious nature and yet not
