them these thoughts and others even more beautiful are in their minds as they gaze at each other now no man will ever be able to say amy or to say ginevra with such a trill as they are saying it ginevra my beloved my amy my better self my other me there is something almost painful in love like this are you well ginevra quite well amy heavens the joy of amy because ginevra is quite well how did my amy sleep i had a good night how happy is ginevra because amy has had a good night all this time they have been slowly approaching each other drawn by a power stronger than themselves their intention is to kiss they do so cosmo snorts and betakes himself to some other room his bedroom probably where a man may be alone with mannish things his razor for instance the maidens do not resent his rudeness they know that poor cosmo s time will come and they are glad to be alone for they have much to say that is for no other mortal ears some of it is sure to go into the diary indeed if we were to put our ear to the drawer where the diary is we could probably hear its little heart ticking in unison with theirs it is ginevra who speaks first she is indeed the bolder of the two she grips amy s hand and says quite firmly amy shall we go to another to night this does not puzzle amy she is prepared for it her honest grey eyes even tell that she has wanted it but now that it is come she quails a little another theatre she murmurs ginevra that would be five in one week ginevra does not blanch yes she says recklessly but it is also only eight in seventeen years isn t it says amy comforted and they have taught us so much haven t they until monday dear when we went to our first real play we didn t know what life is we were two raw unbleached school girls amy absolutely unbleached it is such a phrase as this that gives ginevra the moral ascendancy in their discussions of course amy ventures looking perhaps a little unbleached even now of course i had my diary dear and i do think that even before monday there were things in it of a not wholly ordinary kind nothing persists ginevra cruelly that necessitated your keeping it locked no i suppose not sadly enough you are quite right ginevra but we have made up for lost time every night since monday including the matinee has been a revelation she closes her eyes so that she may see the revelations more clearly so does ginevra amy that heart gripping scene when the love maddened woman visited the man in his chambers she wasn t absolutely love maddened ginevra she really loved her husband best all the time not till the last act darling please don t say it ginevra she was most foolish especially in the crepe de chine but we know that she only went to the man s chambers to get back her letters how i trembled for her then i was strangely calm says ginevra the stony hearted oh ginevra i had such a presentiment that the husband would call at those chambers while she was there and he did ginevra you remember his knock upon the door surely you trembled then ginevra knits her lips triumphantly not even then amy somehow i felt sure that in the nick of time her lady friend would step out from somewhere and say that the letters were hers nobly compromising herself ginevra amy how i love that bit where she says so unexpectedly with noble self renunciation he is my affianced husband isn t it glorious strange ginevra that it happened in each play that was because we always went to the thinking theatres amy real plays are always about a lady and two men and alas only one of them is her husband that is life you know it is called the odd odd triangle yes i know appealingly ginevra i hope it wasn t wrong of me to go a month ago i was only a school girl we both were yes but you are now an art

brangwen men faced inwards to the teeming life of creation which poured unresolved into their veins looking out as she must from the front of her house towards the activity of man in the world at large whilst her husband looked out to the back at sky and harvest and beast and land she strained her eyes to see what man had done in fighting outwards to knowledge she strained to hear how he uttered himself in his conquest her deepest desire hung on the battle that she heard far off being waged on the edge of the unknown she also wanted to know and to be of the fighting host at home even so near as cossethay was the vicar who spoke the other magic language and had the other finer bearing both of which she could perceive but could never attain to the vicar moved in worlds beyond where her own menfolk existed did she not know her own menfolk fresh slow full built men masterful enough but easy native to the earth lacking outwardness and range of motion whereas the vicar dark and dry and small beside her husband had yet a quickness and a range of being that made brangwen in his large geniality seem dull and local she knew her husband but in the vicar s nature was that which passed beyond her knowledge as brangwen had power over the cattle so the vicar had power over her husband what was it in the vicar that raised him above the common men as man is raised above the beast she craved to know she craved to achieve this higher being if not in herself then in her children that which makes a man strong even if he be little and frail in body just as any man is little and frail beside a bull and yet stronger than the bull what was it it was not money nor power nor position what power had the vicar over tom brangwen none yet strip them and set them on a desert island and the vicar was the master his soul was master of the other man s and why why she decided it was a question of knowledge the curate was poor enough and not very efficacious as a man either yet he took rank with those others the superior she watched his children being born she saw them running as tiny things beside their mother and already they were separate from her own children distinct why were her own children marked below the others why should the curate s children inevitably take precedence over her children why should dominance be given them from the start it was not money nor even class it was education and experience she decided it was this this education this higher form of being that the mother wished to give to her children so that they too could live the supreme life on earth for her children at least the children of her heart had the complete nature that should take place in equality with the living vital people in the land not be left behind obscure among the labourers why must they remain obscured and stifled all their lives why should they suffer from lack of freedom to move how should they learn the entry into the finer more vivid circle of life her imagination was fired by the squire s lady at shelly hall who came to church at cossethay with her little children girls in tidy capes of beaver fur and smart little hats herself like a winter rose so fair and delicate so fair so fine in mould so luminous what was it that mrs hardy felt which she mrs brangwen did not feel how was mrs hardy s nature different from that of the common women of cossethay in what was it beyond them all the women of cossethay talked eagerly about mrs hardy of her husband her children her guests her dress of her servants and her housekeeping the lady of the hall was the living dream of their lives her life was the epic that inspired their lives in her they lived imaginatively and in gossiping of her husband who drank of her scandalous brother of lord william bentley her friend member of parliament for the division they had their own odyssey enacting itself penelope and ulysses before them and circe and the swine and the endless web so the women of the village were fortunate they saw themselves in the lady of the manor each of them lived her own fulfilment of the life of mrs hardy and the brangwen wife of the marsh aspired beyond herself towards the further life of the finer woman towards the extended being she revealed as a traveller in his self contained manner reveals far off countries present in himself but why should a knowledge of far off countries make a man s life a different thing finer bigger and why is a man more than the beast and the cattle that serve him it is the same thing the male part of the poem was filled in by such men as the vicar and lord william lean eager men with strange movements men who had command of the further fields whose lives ranged over a great extent ah it was something very desirable to know this touch of the wonderful men who had the power of thought and comprehension the women of the village might be much fonder of tom brangwen and more at their ease with him yet if their lives had been robbed of the vicar and of lord william the leading shoot would have been cut away from them they would have been heavy and uninspired and inclined to hate so long as the wonder of the beyond was before them they could get along whatever their lot and mrs hardy and the vicar and lord william these moved in the wonder of the beyond and were visible to the eyes of cossethay in their motion ii about a canal was constructed across the meadows of the marsh farm connecting the newly opened collieries of the erewash valley a high embankment travelled along the fields to carry the canal which passed close to the

the full respect of all their fellow citizens to how many does that lot now fall during the last years of their lives they were to be saved from any of the horrors of poverty how many now lack the comforts they cannot earn for themselves and to them there would be no degraded feeling that they were the recipients of charity they would be prepared for their departure for the benefit of their country surrounded by all the comforts to which at their time of life they would be susceptible in a college maintained at the public expense and each as he drew nearer to the happy day would be treated with still increasing honour i myself had gone most closely into the question of expense and had found that by the use of machinery the college could almost be made self supporting but we should save on an average for each man and woman who had departed when our population should have become a million presuming that one only in fifty would have reached the desired age the sum actually saved to the colony would amount to a year it would keep us out of debt make for us our railways render all our rivers navigable construct our bridges and leave us shortly the richest people on god s earth and this would be effected by a measure doing more good to the aged than to any other class of the community many arguments were used against us but were vain and futile in their conception in it religion was brought to bear and in talking of this the terrible word murder was brought into common use i remember startling the house by forbidding any member to use a phrase so revolting to the majesty of the people murder did any one who attempted to deter us by the use of foul language bethink himself that murder to be murder must be opposed to the law this thing was to be done by the law there can be no other murder if a murderer be hanged in england i mean for in britannula we have no capital punishment is that murder it is not so only because the law enacts it i and a few others did succeed at last in stopping the use of that word then they talked to us of methuselah and endeavoured to draw an argument from the age of the patriarchs i asked them in committee whether they were prepared to prove that the years as spoken of in genesis were the same measure of time as years now and told them that if the sanitary arrangements of the world would again permit men to live as long as the patriarchs we would gladly change the fixed period in fact there was not a word to be said against us except that which referred to the feelings of the young and old feelings are changeable i told them at that great and glorious meeting which we had at gladstonopolis and though naturally governed only by instinct would be taught at last to comply with reason i had lately read how feelings had been allowed in england to stand in the way of the great work of cremation a son will not like you say to lead his father into the college but ought he not to like to do so and if so will not reason teach him to like to do what he ought i can conceive with rapture the pride the honour the affection with which when the fixed period had come i could have led my father into the college there to enjoy for twelve months that preparation for euthanasia which no cares for this world would be allowed to disturb all the existing ideas of the grave would be absent there would be no further struggles to prolong the time of misery which nature had herself produced that temptation to the young to begrudge to the old the costly comforts which they could not earn would be no longer fostered it would be a pride for the young man to feel that his parent s name had been enrolled to all coming time in the bright books of the college which was to be established for the fixed period i have a son of my own and i have carefully educated him to look forward to the day in which he shall deposit me there as the proudest of his life circumstances as i shall relate in this story have somewhat interfered with him but he will i trust yet come back to the right way of thinking that i shall never spend that last happy year within the walls of the college is to me from a selfish point of view the saddest part of england s reassuming our island as a colony my readers will perceive that i am an enthusiast but there are reforms so great that a man cannot but be enthusiastic when he has received into his very soul the truth of any human improvement alas me i shall never live to see carried out the glory of this measure to which i have devoted the best years of my existence the college which has been built under my auspices as a preparation for the happy departure is to be made a chamber of commerce those aged men who were awaiting as i verily believe in impatience the coming day of their perfected dignity have been turned loose in the world and allowed to grovel again with mundane thoughts amidst the idleness of years that are useless our bridges our railways our government are not provided for our young men are again becoming torpid beneath the weight imposed upon them i was in truth wrong to think that so great a reform could be brought to perfection within the days of the first reformers a divine idea has to be made common to men s minds by frequent ventilation before it will be seen to be fit for humanity did not the first christians all suffer affliction poverty and martyrdom how many centuries has it taken in the history of the world to induce it to denounce the not yet abolished theory of slavery a throne a lord and a bishop still remain

used to this you will have the opportunity if you choose she laughed softly if i choose she repeated why it is all like fairyland to me he nodded you come he said from a very quiet life you will find things here different do you know what these are he touched a little row of black instruments which stood on the top of his desk she shook her head doubtfully i am not quite sure she admitted they are telephones he said this one touching the first is a private wire to my offices in wall street this one laying a finger upon the second is a private wire to the bank of which i am president these two

beneath my foot all the telephones were at once disconnected here and connected with my secretaries room i can sit here at this table and shake the money markets of the world i can send stocks up or

said i am a millionaire a good many times over or i should not be of much account in new york but there i have told you enough about myself i sent for you as you know because there are times when i feel a little lonely and i thought that if my sister could spare one of her children it would be a kindly act and one which i might perhaps be able to repay do you think that you would like to live here with me virginia and be mistress of this house she shrank a little away the prospect was not without its terrifying side why i should love it she declared but i simply shouldn t dare to think of it you don t understand i am afraid the way we live down at wellham springs we have really no servants and we do everything ourselves i couldn t attempt to manage a house like this he smiled at her kindly perhaps he said you would find it less difficult than you think there is a housekeeper already who sees to all the practical part of it she only needs to have some one to whom she can refer now and then you would have nothing whatever to do with the managing of the servants the commissariat or anything of that sort yours would be purely social duties i am afraid she answered that i should know even less about them well he said i have some good friends who will give you hints you will find it very much easier than you imagine you have only to be natural acquire the art of listening and wear pretty gowns and you will find it a simple matter to become quite a popular person she nerved herself to ask him a question he looked so kind and good natured that it did not seem possible that he would resent it uncle she said of course i am very glad to be here and it all sounds very delightful but what about stella he leaned back in his chair there was a pained look in his face she was almost sorry that she had mentioned his daughter s name perhaps he said it is as well that you should have asked me that question i have always been an indulgent father as i think you will find me an indulgent uncle but there are certain things certain offences i might say for which i have no forgiveness stella deceived me she made use of information secret information which she acquired in this room to benefit some man in whom she was interested she used my secrets to enrich this person she did this after i had warned her i never warn twice you mean that you sent her away she asked timidly i mean that my doors are closed to her he answered gravely as they would be closed upon you if you behaved as stella has behaved but my dear child he added smiling kindly at her i do not expect this from you i feel sure that what i have said will be sufficient if you will stay with me a little time and take my daughter s place i think you will not find me very stern or very ungrateful now i am

been to new york before never she answered i have been to boston twice never anywhere else he smiled well he said the sooner you are introduced to some of its wonders the better we will dine out to night and i will take you to one of the famous restaurants it will suit me better to be somewhere out of the way for an hour or two this evening there is a panic in chicago and illinois but there you

animal with his coat lest it should betray him as it chanced the great fight of the day that of the regiment of veterans which sir melmoth informed me panda had sent down at the last moment to the assistance of umbelazi his favourite son took place almost at the foot of this kopje mr quatermain in his narrative calls this regiment the amawombe but my recollection is that the name sir melmoth osborn gave them was the greys or upunga whatever their exact title may have been however they made a great stand at least he told me that when umbelazi s impi or army began to give before the usutu onslaught these greys moved forward above strong drawn up in a triple line and were charged by one of cetewayo s regiments the opposing forces met and the noise of their clashing shields said sir melmoth was like the roll of heavy thunder then while he watched the veteran greys passed over the opposing regiment as a wave passes over a rock these were his exact words and leaving about a third of their number dead or wounded among the bodies of the annihilated foe charged on to meet a second regiment sent against them by cetewayo with these the struggle was repeated but again the greys conquered only now there were not more than five or six hundred of them left upon their feet these survivors ran to a mound round which they formed a ring and here for a long while withstood the attack of a third regiment until at length they perished almost to a man buried beneath heaps of their slain assailants the usutu truly they made a noble end fighting thus against tremendous odds as for the number who fell at this battle of endondakusuka mr fynney in a pamphlet which he wrote says that six of umbelazi s brothers died whilst it is estimated that upwards of of the people men women and children were slain a high and indeed an impossible estimate that curious personage named john dunn an englishman who became a zulu chief and who actually fought in this battle as narrated by mr quatermain however puts the number much lower what the true total was will never be known but sir melmoth osborn told me that when he swam his horse back across the tugela that night it was black with bodies and sir theophilus shepstone also told me that when he visited the scene a day or two later the banks of the river were strewn with multitudes of them male and female it was from mr fynney that i heard the story of the execution by cetewayo of the man who appeared before him with the ornaments of umbelazi announcing that he had killed the prince with his own hand of course this tale as mr quatermain points out bears a striking resemblance to that recorded in the old testament in connection with the death of king saul it by no means follows however that it is therefore apocryphal indeed mr fynney assured me that it was quite true although if he gave me his authorities i cannot remember them after a lapse of more than thirty years the exact circumstances of umbelazi s death are unknown but the general report was that he died not by the assegais of the usutu but of a broken heart another story declares that he was drowned his body was never found and it is therefore probable that it sank in the tugela as is suggested in the following pages i have only to add that it is quite in accordance with zulu beliefs that a man should be haunted by the ghost of one whom he has murdered or betrayed or to be more accurate that the spirit umoya should enter into the slayer and drive him mad or in such a case that spirit might bring misfortune upon him his family or his tribe h

as human nature appears to us with all its trappings and accessories seen dimly through the glass of our conventions leaving out those aspects of it which we have forgotten or do not think it polite to mention but i allan quatermain reflecting upon these matters in my ignorant and uneducated fashion have always held that no one really understands human nature who has not studied it in the rough well that is the aspect of it with which i have been best acquainted for most of the years of my life i have handled the raw material the virgin ore not the finished ornament that is smelted out of it if indeed it is finished yet which i greatly doubt i dare say that a time may come when the perfected generations if civilisation as we understand it really has a future and any such should be allowed to enjoy their hour on the world will look back to us as crude half developed creatures whose only merit was that we handed on the flame of life maybe maybe for everything goes by comparison and at one end of the ladder is the ape man and at the other as we hope the angel no not the angel he belongs to a different sphere but that last expression of humanity upon which i will not speculate while man is man that is before he suffers the magical death change into spirit if such should be his destiny well he will remain man i mean that the same passions will sway him he will aim at the same ambitions he will know the same joys

speech makers atlantic monthly december on poetry and belles lettres the function of the poet this was the concluding lecture in the course which lowell read before the lowell institute in the winter of doubtless lowell never printed it because as his genius matured he felt that its assertions were too absolute and that its style bore too many marks of haste in composition and was too rhetorical for an essay to be read in print how rapid was the growth of his intellectual judgment and the broadening of his imaginative view may be seen by comparing it with his essays on swinburne on percival and on rousseau published in and essays in which the topics of this lecture were touched upon anew though not treated at large but the spirit of this lecture is so fine its tone so full of the enthusiasm of youth its conception of the poet so lofty and the truths it contains so important that it may well be prized as the expression of a genius which if not yet mature is already powerful and aquiline alike in vision and in sweep of wing it is not unworthy to stand with sidney s and with shelley s defence of poesy and it is fitted to warm and inspire the poetic heart of the youth of this generation no less than of that to which it was first addressed as a close to the lecture lowell read his beautiful then unpublished poem to the muse charles eliot norton whether as some philosophers assume we possess only the fragments of a great cycle of knowledge in whose centre stood the primeval man in friendly relation with the powers of the universe and build our hovels out of the ruins of our ancestral palace or whether according to the development theory of others we are rising gradually and have come up out of an atom instead of descending from an adam so that the proudest pedigree might run up to a barnacle or a zoophyte at last are questions that will keep for a good many centuries yet confining myself to what little we can learn from history we find tribes rising slowly out of barbarism to a higher or lower point of culture and civility and everywhere the poet also is found under one name or other changing in certain outward respects but essentially the same and however far we go back we shall find this also that the poet and the priest were united originally in the same person which means that the poet was he who was conscious of the world of spirit as well as that of sense and was the ambassador of the gods to men this was his highest function and hence his name of seer he was the discoverer and declarer of the perennial beneath the deciduous his were the epea pteroenta the true winged words that could fly down the unexplored future and carry the names of ancestral heroes of the brave and wise and good it was thus that the poet could reward virtue and by and by as society grew more complex could burn in the brand of shame

i dropped a half crown into his soft broad palm well says he with a sudden grin from ear to ear i never knew him keep any of you gentlemen so long he failed two second mates this morning before your turn came less than twenty minutes each that s about his usual time i found myself downstairs without being aware of the steps as if i had floated down the staircase the finest day in my life the day you get your first command is nothing to it for one thing a man is not so young then and for another with us you know there is nothing much more to expect yes the finest day of one s life no doubt but then it is just a day and no more what comes after is about the most unpleasant time for a youngster the trying to get an officer s berth with nothing much to show but a brand new certificate it is surprising how useless you find that piece of ass s skin that you have been putting yourself in such a state about it didn t strike me at the time that a board of trade certificate does not make an officer not by a long long way but the skippers of the ships i was haunting with demands for a job knew that very well i don t wonder at them now and i don t blame them either but this trying to get a ship is pretty hard on a youngster all the same he went on then to tell us how tired he was and how discouraged by this lesson of disillusion following swiftly upon the finest day of his life he told us how he went the round of all the ship owners offices in the city where some junior clerk would furnish him with printed forms of application which he took home to fill up in the evening he used to run out just before midnight to post them in the nearest pillar box and that was all that ever came of it in his own words he might just as well have dropped them all properly addressed and stamped into the sewer grating then one day as he was wending his weary way to the docks he met a friend and former shipmate a little older than himself outside the fenchurch street railway station he craved for sympathy but his friend had just got a ship that very morning and was hurrying home in a state of outward joy and inward uneasiness usual to a sailor who after many days of waiting suddenly gets a berth this friend had the time to condole with him but briefly he must be moving then as he was running off over his shoulder as it were he suggested why don t you go and speak to mr powell in the shipping office our friend objected that he did not know mr powell from adam and the other already pretty near round the corner shouted back advice go to the private door of the shipping office and walk right up to him his desk is by the window go up boldly and say i sent you our new acquaintance looking from one to the other of us declared upon my word i had grown so desperate that i d have gone boldly up to the devil himself on the mere hint that he had a second mate s job to give away it was at this point that interrupting his flow of talk to light his pipe but holding us with his eye he inquired whether we had known powell marlow with a slight reminiscent smile murmured that he remembered him very well then there was a pause our new acquaintance had become involved in a vexatious difficulty with his pipe which had suddenly betrayed his trust and disappointed his anticipation of self indulgence to keep the ball rolling i asked marlow if this powell was remarkable in any way he was not exactly remarkable marlow answered with his usual nonchalance in a general way it s very difficult for one to become remarkable people won t take sufficient notice of one don t you know i remember powell so well simply because as one of the shipping masters in the port of london he dispatched me to sea on several long stages of my sailor s pilgrimage he resembled socrates i mean he resembled him genuinely that is in the face a philosophical mind is but an accident he reproduced exactly the familiar bust of the immortal sage if you will imagine the bust with a high top hat riding far on the back of the head and a black coat over the shoulders as i never saw him except from the other side of the long official counter bearing the five writing desks of the five shipping masters mr powell has remained a bust to me our new acquaintance advanced now from the mantelpiece with his pipe in good working order what was the most remarkable about powell he enunciated dogmatically with his head in a cloud of smoke is that he should have had just that name you see my name happens to be powell too it was clear that this intelligence was not imparted to us for social purposes it required no acknowledgment we continued to gaze at him with expectant eyes he gave himself up to the vigorous enjoyment of his pipe for a silent minute or two then picking up the thread of his story he told us how he had started hot foot for tower hill he had not been that way since the day of his examination the finest day of his life the day of his overweening pride it was very different now he would not have called the queen his cousin still but this time it was from a sense of profound abasement he didn t think himself good enough for anybody s kinship he envied the purple nosed old cab drivers on the stand the boot black boys at the edge of the pavement the two large bobbies pacing slowly along the tower gardens railings in the consciousness of their infallible might and the bright scarlet sentries walking smartly to and fro before the mint he envied them their places in the scheme of world s labour and he envied also the miserable sallow thin faced loafers blinking their

soft curly hair and bright earnest eyes that speaks a sturdy little fellow of four presses up to the mother s knee and repeats the question sha n t we have a christmas mother it overcomes the poor woman she leans forward and breaks into sobbing a tempest of sorrow long suppressed that shakes her weak frame as she thinks that her husband is out of work desperate discouraged and tempted of the devil that the rent is falling due and only the poor pay of her needle to meet it with in one of those quick flashes which concentrate through the imagination the sorrows of years she seems to see her little home broken up her husband in the gutter her children turned into the street at this moment there goes up from her heart a despairing cry such as a poor hunted tired out creature gives when brought to the last gasp of endurance it was like the shriek of the hare when the hounds are upon it she clasps her hands and cries out o my god help me there was no voice of any that answered there was no sound of foot fall on the staircase no one entered the door and yet that agonized cry had reached the heart it was meant for the shining ones were with her they stood with faces full of tenderness beaming down upon her they brought her a christmas gift from christ the gift of trust she knew not from whence came the courage and rest that entered her soul but while her little ones stood wondering and silent she turned and drew to herself her well worn bible hands that she did not see guided her as she turned the pages and pointed the words he shall deliver the needy when he crieth the poor also and him that hath no helper he shall spare the poor and needy and shall save the souls of the needy he shall redeem their soul from deceit and violence and precious shall their blood be in his sight she laid down her poor wan cheek on the merciful old book as on her mother s breast and gave up all the tangled skein of life into the hands of infinite pity there seemed a consoling presence in the room and her tired heart found rest she wiped away her tears kissed her children and smiled upon them then she rose gathered up her finished work and attired herself to go forth and carry it back to the shop mother said the children softly they are dressing the church and the gates are open and people are going in and out mayn t we play there by the church the mother looked out on the ivy grown walls of the church with its flocks of twittering sparrows and said yes my little birds you may play there if you ll be very good and quiet the mother had only her small close attic room for her darlings and to satisfy all their childish desire for variety and motion she had only the refuge of the streets she was a decent godly woman and the bold manners and evil words of street vagrants were terrible to her and so when the church gates were open for daily morning and evening prayers she had often begged the sexton to let her little ones come in and hear the singing and wander hand in hand around the old church walls he was a kindly old man and the children stealing round like two still bright eyed little mice had gained upon his heart and he made them welcome there it gave the mother a feeling of protection to have them play near the church as if it were a father s house so she put on their little hoods and tippets and led them forth and saw them into the yard and as she looked to the old gray church with its rustling ivy bowers and flocks of birds her heart swelled within her yea the sparrow hath found a house and the swallow a nest where she

psychological study i shall attempt to leave some record of captain nicholas craigie a man s outer case generally gives some indication of the soul within the captain is tall and well formed with dark handsome face and a curious way of twitching his limbs which may arise from nervousness or be simply an outcome of his excessive energy his jaw and whole cast of countenance is manly and resolute but the eyes are the distinctive feature of his face they are of the very darkest hazel bright and eager with a singular mixture of recklessness in their expression and of something else which i have sometimes thought was more allied with horror than any other emotion generally the former predominated but on occasions and more particularly when he was thoughtfully inclined the look of fear would spread and deepen until it imparted a new character to his whole countenance it is at these times that he is most subject to tempestuous fits of anger and he seems to be aware of it for i have known him lock himself up so that no one might approach him until his dark hour was passed he sleeps badly and i have heard him shouting during the night but his cabin is some little distance from mine and i could never distinguish the words which he said this is one phase of his character and the most disagreeable one it is only through my close association with him thrown together as we are day after day that i have observed it otherwise he is an agreeable companion well read and entertaining and as gallant a seaman as ever trod a deck i shall not easily forget the way in which he handled the ship when we were caught by a gale among the loose ice at the beginning of april i have never seen him so cheerful and even hilarious as he was that night as he paced backwards and forwards upon the bridge amid the flashing of the lightning and the howling of the wind he has told me several times that the thought of death was a pleasant one to him which is a sad thing for a young man to say he cannot be much more than thirty though his hair and moustache are already slightly grizzled some great sorrow must have overtaken him and blighted his whole life perhaps i should be the same if i lost my flora god knows i think if it were not for her that i should care very little whether the wind blew from the north or the south to morrow there i hear him come down the companion and he has locked himself up in his room which shows that he is still in an unamiable mood and so to bed as old pepys would say for the candle is burning down we have to use them now since the nights are closing in and the steward has turned in so there are no hopes of another one september th calm clear day and still lying in the same position what wind there is comes from the south east but it is very slight captain is in a better humour and apologised to me at breakfast for his rudeness he still looks somewhat distrait however and retains that wild look in his eyes which in a highlander would mean that he was fey at least so our chief engineer remarked to me and he has some reputation among the celtic portion of our crew as a seer and expounder of omens it is strange that superstition should have obtained such mastery over this hard headed and practical race i could not have believed to what an extent it is carried had i not observed it for myself we have had a perfect epidemic of it this voyage until i have felt inclined to serve out rations of sedatives and nerve tonics with the saturday allowance of grog the first symptom of it was that shortly after leaving shetland the men at the wheel used to complain that they heard plaintive cries and screams in the wake of the ship as if something were following it and were unable to overtake it this fiction has been kept up during the whole voyage and on dark nights at the beginning of the seal fishing it was only with great difficulty that men could be induced to do their spell no doubt what they heard was either the creaking of the rudder chains or the cry of some passing sea bird i have been fetched out of bed several times to listen to it but i need hardly say that i was never able to distinguish anything unnatural the men however are so absurdly positive upon the subject that it is hopeless to argue with them i mentioned the matter to the captain once but to my surprise he took it very gravely and indeed appeared to be considerably disturbed by what i told him i should have thought that he at least would have been above such vulgar delusions all this disquisition upon superstition leads me up to the fact that mr manson our second mate saw a ghost last night or at least says that he did which of course is the same thing it is quite refreshing to have some new topic of conversation after the eternal routine of bears and whales which has served us for so many months manson swears the ship is haunted and that he would not stay in her a day if he had any other place to go to indeed the fellow is honestly frightened and i had to give him some chloral and bromide of potassium this morning to steady him down he seemed quite indignant when i suggested that he had been having an extra glass the night before and i was obliged to pacify him by keeping as grave a countenance as possible during his story which he certainly narrated in a very straight forward and matter of fact way i was on the bridge he said about four bells in the middle watch just when the night was at its darkest there was a bit of a moon but the clouds were blowing across it so that you couldn t see far from the ship john m leod the

with my purchase leaping joyfully at my heels the man chuckled a good deal after receiving the money but i took no notice of that at the time though i thought a good deal about it afterwards ah little did i think as dumps and i walked home that day of the depth of the attachment that was to spring up between us the varied experiences of life we were destined to have together and the important influence he was to exercise on my career forgot to mention that my name is mellon john mellon dumps knows my name as well as he knows his own on reaching home dumps displayed an evidence of good breeding which convinced me that he could not have spent all his puppyhood in company with the man from whom i had bought him he wiped his feet on the door mat with great vigour before entering my house and also refused to pass in until i led the way now dumps said i seating myself on the sofa in my solitary room i was a bachelor at the time a medical student just on the point of completing my course come here and let us have a talk to my surprise the doggie came promptly forward sat down on his hind legs and looked up into my face i was touched by this display of ready confidence a confiding nature has always been to me powerfully attractive whether in child cat or dog i brushed the shaggy hair from his face in order to see his eyes they were moist and intensely black so was the point of his nose you seem to be an affectionate doggie dumps a portion of hair scarce worthy the name of tail wagged as i spoke and he attempted to lick my fingers but i prevented this by patting his head i have an unconquerable aversion to licking perhaps having received more than an average allowance in another sense at school may account for my dislike to it even from a dog now dumps i continued you and i are to be good friends i ve bought you for a pretty large sum too let me tell you from a man who i am quite sure treated you ill and i intend to show you what good treatment is but there are two things i mean to insist on and it is well that we should understand each other at the outset of our united career you must never bark at my friends not even at my enemies when they come to see me and you must not beg at meals d you understand the way in which that shaggy creature cocked its ears and turned its head from side to side slowly and gazed with its lustrous eyes while i was speaking went far to convince me it really did understand what i said of course it only wagged its rear tuft of hair in reply and whimpered slightly refer to its rear tuft advisedly because at a short distance my doggie when in repose resembled an elongated and shapeless mass but when roused by a call or otherwise three tufts of hair instantly sprang up two at one end and one at the other end indicating his ears and tail it was only by these signs that i could ascertain at any time his exact position i was about to continue my remarks to dumps when the door opened and my landlady appeared bearing the dinner tray oh i beg parding sir she said drawing back i didn t ear your voice sir till the door was open an i thought you was alone but i can come back a come in mrs miff there is nobody

forty two miles from london surely it brought things within the suburban range if matching s easy were in america commuters would live there but in supposing that mr direck displayed his ignorance of a fact of the greatest importance to all who would understand england there is a gap in the suburbs of london the suburbs of london stretch west and south and even west by north but to the north eastward there are no suburbs instead there is essex essex is not a suburban county it is a characteristic and individualised county which wins the heart between dear essex and the centre of things lie two great barriers the east end of london and epping forest before a train could get to any villadom with a cargo of season ticket holders it would have to circle about this rescued woodland and travel for twenty unprofitable miles and so once you are away from the main great eastern lines essex still lives in the peace of the eighteenth century and london the modern babylon is like the stars

only stopped by request the thing was getting better and better and when mr direck seized his grip and got out of the train there was just one little old essex station master and porter and signalman and everything holding a red flag in his hand and talking to mr britling about the cultivation of the sweet peas which glorified the station and there was the mr britling who was the only item of business and the greatest expectation in mr direck s european journey and he was quite unlike the portraits mr direck had seen and quite unmistakably mr britling all the same since there was nobody else upon the platform and he was advancing with a gesture of welcome did you ever see such peas mr dick said mr britling by way of introduction my word said mr direck in a good old farmer hayseed kind of voice aye ya said the station master in singularly strident tones it be a rare year for sweet peas and then he slammed the door of the carriage in a leisurely manner and did dismissive things

with the best thought of the age too busily occupied with practical realities to follow the thought of the age through all its divagations and into all its recesses these massachusetts business men had had to consider methods of access more quintessential and nuclear and they had decided not to hunt out the best thought in its merely germinating stages but to wait until it had emerged and flowered to some trustworthy recognition and then rather than toil through recondite and possibly already reconsidered books and writings generally to offer an impressive fee to the emerged new

definite opinions upon their teaching and mr britling was one of the representative thinkers upon which this society had decided to inform itself it was to broach this invitation and to offer him the impressive honorarium by which the society honoured not only its guests but itself that mr direck had now come to matching s easy he had already sent mr britling a letter of introduction not indeed intimating his precise purpose but mentioning merely a desire to know him and the letter had been so happily phrased and its writer had left such a memory of pleasant hospitality on mr britling s mind during mr britling s former visit to new york that it had immediately produced for mr direck an invitation not merely to come and see him but to come and stay over the week end and here they were shaking hands mr britling did not look at all as mr direck had expected him to look he had expected an englishman in a country costume of golfing tweeds like the englishman in country costume one sees in american illustrated stories drooping out of the country costume of golfing tweeds he had expected to see the mildly unhappy face pensive even to its drooping moustache with which mr britling s publisher had for some faulty and unfortunate reason familiarised the american public instead of this mr britling was in a miscellaneous costume and mildness was the last quality one could attribute to him his moustache his hair his eyebrows bristled his flaming freckled face seemed about to bristle too his little hazel eyes came out with a ping and looked at mr direck mr britling was one of a large but still remarkable class of people who seem at the mere approach of photography to change their hair their clothes their moral natures no photographer had ever caught a hint of his essential britlingness and bristlingness only the camera could ever induce mr britling to brush his hair and for the camera alone did he reserve that expression of submissive martyrdom mr direck knew and mr

head of a maiden whom i shall always call hermann s niece because as a matter of fact i ve never heard her name for all my intimacy with the family this however sprang up later on meantime in common with the rest of the shipping in that eastern port i was left in no doubt as to hermann s notions of hygienic clothing evidently he believed in wearing good stout flannel next his skin on most days little frocks and pinafores could be seen drying in the mizzen rigging of his ship or a tiny row of socks fluttering on the signal halyards but once a fortnight the family washing was exhibited in force it covered the poop entirely the afternoon breeze would incite to a weird and flabby activity all that crowded mass of clothing with its vague suggestions of drowned mutilated and flattened humanity trunks without heads waved at you arms without hands legs without feet kicked fantastically with collapsible flourishes and there were long white garments that taking the wind fairly through their neck openings edged with lace became for a moment violently distended as by the passage of obese and invisible bodies on these days you could make out that ship at a great distance by the multi coloured grotesque riot going on abaft her mizzen mast she had her berth just ahead of me and her name was diana diana not of ephesus but of bremen this was proclaimed in white letters a foot long spaced widely across the stern somewhat like the lettering of a shop sign under the cottage windows this ridiculously unsuitable name struck one as an impertinence towards the memory of the most charming of goddesses for apart from the fact that the old craft was physically incapable of engaging in any sort of chase there was a gang of four children belonging to her they peeped over the rail at passing boats and occasionally dropped various objects into them thus sometime before i knew hermann to speak to i received on my hat a horrid rag doll belonging to hermann s eldest daughter however these youngsters were upon the whole well behaved they had fair heads round eyes round little knobby noses and they resembled their father a good deal this diana of bremen was a most innocent old ship and seemed to know nothing of the wicked sea as there are on shore households that know nothing of the corrupt world and the sentiments she suggested were unexceptionable and mainly of a domestic order she was a home all these dear children had learned to walk on her roomy quarter deck in such thoughts there is something pretty even touching their teeth i should judge they had cut on the ends of her running gear i have many times observed the baby hermann nicholas engaged in gnawing the whipping of the fore royal brace nicholas favourite place of residence was under the main fife rail directly he was let loose he would crawl off there and the first seaman who came along would bring him carefully held aloft in tarry hands back to the cabin door i fancy there must have been a standing order to that effect in the course of these transportations the baby who was the only peppery person in the ship tried to smite these stalwart young german sailors on the face mrs hermann an engaging stout housewife wore on board baggy blue dresses with white dots when as happened once or twice i caught her at an elegant little wash tub rubbing hard on white collars baby s socks and hermann s summer neckties she would blush in girlish confusion and raising her wet hands greet me from afar with many friendly nods her sleeves would be rolled up to the elbows and the gold hoop of her wedding ring glittered among the soapsuds her voice was pleasant she had a serene brow smooth bands of very fair hair and a good humoured expression of the eyes she was motherly and moderately talkative when this simple matron smiled youthful dimples broke out on her fresh broad cheeks hermann s niece on the other hand an orphan and very silent i never saw attempt a smile this however was not gloom on her part but the restraint of youthful gravity they had carried her about with them for the last three years to help with the children and be company for mrs hermann as hermann mentioned once to me it had been very necessary while they were all little he had added in a vexed manner it was her arm and her sleek head that i had glimpsed one morning through the stern windows of the cabin hovering over the pots of fuchsias and mignonette but the first time i beheld her full length i surrendered to her proportions they fix her in my mind as great beauty great intelligence quickness of wit or kindness of heart might have made some her other woman equally memorable with her it was form and size it was her physical personality that had this imposing charm she might have been witty intelligent and kind to an exceptional degree i don t know and this is not to the point all i know is that she was built on a magnificent scale built is the only word she was constructed she was erected as it were with a regal lavishness it staggered you to see this reckless expenditure of material upon a chit of a girl she was youthful and also perfectly mature as though she had been some fortunate immortal she was heavy too perhaps but that s nothing it only added to that notion of permanence she was barely nineteen but such shoulders such round arms such a shadowing forth of mighty limbs when with three long strides she pounced across the deck upon the overturned nicholas it s perfectly indescribable she seemed a good quiet girl vigilant as to lena s needs gustav s tumbles the state of carl s dear little nose conscientious hardworking and all that but what magnificent hair she had abundant long thick of a tawny colour it had the sheen of precious metals she wore it plaited

a room in the basement of miss fulsom s school where the nurses wait they sat on forms while nana lay on the floor but that was the only difference they affected to ignore her as of an inferior social status to themselves and she despised their light talk she resented visits to the nursery from mrs darling s friends but if they did come she first whipped off michael s pinafore and put him into the one with blue braiding and smoothed out wendy and made a dash at john s hair no nursery could possibly have been conducted more correctly and mr darling knew it yet he sometimes wondered uneasily whether the neighbours talked he had his position in the city to consider nana also troubled him in another way he had sometimes a feeling that she did not admire him i know she admires you tremendously george mrs darling would assure him and then she would sign to the children to be specially nice to father lovely dances followed in which the only other servant liza was sometimes allowed to join such a midget she looked in her long skirt and maid s cap though she had sworn when engaged that she would never see ten again the gaiety of those romps and gayest of all was mrs darling who would pirouette so wildly that all you could see of her was the kiss and then if you had dashed at her you might have got it there never was a simpler happier family until the coming of peter pan mrs darling first heard of peter when she was tidying up her children s minds it is the nightly custom of every good mother after her children are asleep to rummage in their minds and put things straight for next morning repacking into their proper places the many articles that have wandered during the day if you could keep awake but of course you can t you would see your own mother doing this and you would find it very interesting to watch her it is quite like tidying up drawers you would see her on her knees i expect lingering humorously over some of your contents wondering where on earth you had picked this thing up making discoveries sweet and not so sweet pressing this to her cheek as if it were as nice as a kitten and hurriedly stowing that out of sight when you wake in the morning the naughtiness and evil passions with which you went to bed have been folded up small and placed at the bottom of your mind and on the top beautifully aired are spread out your prettier thoughts ready for you to put on i don t know whether you have ever seen a map of a person s mind doctors sometimes draw maps of other parts of you and your own map can become intensely interesting but catch them trying to draw a map of a child s mind which is not only confused but keeps going round all the time there are zigzag lines on it just like your temperature on a card and these are probably roads in the island for the neverland is always more or less an island with astonishing splashes of colour here and there and coral reefs and rakish looking craft in the offing and savages and lonely lairs and gnomes who are mostly tailors and caves through which a river runs and princes with six elder brothers and a hut fast going to decay and one very small old lady with a hooked nose it would be an easy map if that were all but there is also first day at school religion fathers the round pond needle work murders hangings verbs that take the dative chocolate pudding day getting into braces say ninety nine three pence for pulling out your tooth yourself and so on and either these are part of the island or they are another map showing through and it is all rather confusing especially as nothing will stand still of course the neverlands vary a good deal john s for instance had a lagoon with flamingoes flying over it at which john was shooting while michael who was very small had a flamingo with lagoons flying over it john lived in a boat turned upside down on the sands michael in a wigwam wendy in a house of leaves deftly sewn together john had no friends michael had friends at night wendy had a pet wolf forsaken by its parents but on the whole the neverlands have a family resemblance and if they stood still in a row you could say of them that they have each other s nose and so forth on these magic shores children at play are for ever beaching their coracles simple boat we too have been there we can still hear the sound of the surf though we shall land no more of all delectable islands the neverland is the snuggest and most compact not large and sprawly you know with tedious distances between one adventure and another but nicely crammed when you play at it by day with the chairs and table cloth it is not in the least alarming but in the two minutes before you go to sleep it becomes very real that is why there are night lights occasionally in her travels through her children s minds mrs darling found things she could not understand and of these quite the most perplexing was the word peter she knew of no peter and yet he was

presented to the astonished natives of ratinga in a short calico gown of sunflower pattern with a flounce at the bottom a bright yellow neckerchief and a coal scuttle bonnet which quivered somewhat in consequence of being too large and of slender build decency and propriety not being recognised apparently among infants the brown baby who had been named zariffa at baptism landed in what may be styled adamite costume then waroonga built himself a bamboo house and set up a school soon after that he induced a half italian half spanish sailor named antonio zeppa who had been bred in england to settle with his wife and son on the island and take charge of the school for this post zeppa and his wife were well qualified both having received an education beyond that usually given to persons in their rank of life besides this antonio zeppa had a gigantic frame a genial disposition and a spirit of humility or rather childlike simplicity which went far to ingratiate him with the savages after several years residence in this field of labour waroonga conceived the grand idea of building a house of god it was to be built of coral rock cemented together with coral lime now it was while the good people of ratinga were in the first fervour of this new enterprise that the dinghy with its three occupants approached their shore at that particular point of time the walls of the new church had begun to rise above the foundations for the chief tomeo had entered into the matter with intense enthusiasm and as tomeo was supreme chief every one else felt bound to follow his example and work hard but to do them justice they required no stimulant the whole community entered into it with inexpressible glee zeppa taught them everything because no one else knew anything except of course waroonga who however was not much in advance of his native congregation save in spiritual matters zeppa showed them how to burn lime out of the coral rock and they gazed with open eyed and open mouthed wonder at the process then the great chief tomeo gave the word to burn lime and buttchee the chief second in command backed him up by kicking the native nearest to his foot and echoing the order go burn lime the entire population began to burn lime forthwith and would have gone on burning lime enough to have built a south sea pyramid equal to cheops if they had not been checked and their blazing energies turned into stone hewing and dressing and other channels thus the work went on merrily and so engrossed were they with it that they did not at first observe the arrival of the visitors of course they were aware of the schooner s presence and had been off to her the previous day before she had furled her sails to offer fruits and vegetables but it was some time before they discovered that three strangers had landed and were gazing at them while they toiled zeppa had a black servant a negro whom he had induced to follow him this man took a prominent oversight of the works he was by nature a cook but church building occupied his leisure moments and he prided himself upon being not only cleverer but considerably blacker than the islanders now you keep out ob de road leetil za this was addressed to zariffa who by that time could not only toddle but trowel besides being able to swim like a duck take care missy za dat clumsy feller wid the big stone let him fall and oh the negro gave vent to a yell for the accident he feared actually occurred the clumsy native let a huge piece of coral rock fall from his shoulder which just missed crushing the brown little girl it dropped on a mass of soft lime which flew up in all directions making zariffa piebald at once and what was more serious sending a lump straight into tomeo s face this was too much for the great man he seized the culprit by the neck and thrust his brown visage down upon the lime from which he arose white leaving a beautiful cast of his features behind him tomeo was pacified at once he burst into a loud laugh while the guilty man slunk humbly away not however without receiving a salute from buttchee s active foot in passing at this moment zeppa came up holding his son orlando a well grown lad of fourteen by the hand he at once observed the captain of the schooner and going forward shook hands with him and the mate he had made their acquaintance the day before when the vessel anchored in the lagoon i have come to say good bye mr zeppa we have finished taking in fresh water sooner than i had expected and will be ready to sail with the evening breeze indeed i regret this for various reasons replied zeppa in a soft musical voice that one scarcely expected to issue from such a capacious chest there was about the man an air of gentle urbanity and tenderness which might have induced a stranger to suppose him effeminate had not his manly looks and commanding stature rendered the idea absurd in the first place he continued my wife and i had hoped to show you some hospitality you know we seldom have visitors to this out of the way island then we wanted your advice with regard to the building of our church which you see is progressing rapidly and last but not least i wished to ask a favour

it was more than a year before i got farther than a nod with him farrar s nod in itself was a repulsion and once you had seen it you mentally scored him from the list of your possible friends besides this freezing exterior he possessed a cutting and cynical tongue and had but little confidence in the human race these qualities did not tend to render him popular in a western town if indeed they would have recommended him anywhere and i confess to have thought him a surly enough fellow being guided by general opinion and superficial observation afterwards the town got to know him and if it did not precisely like him it respected him which perhaps is better and he gained at least a few warm friends among whom i deem it an honor to be mentioned farrar s contempt for consequences finally brought him an unsought for reputation admiration for him was born the day he pushed o meara out of his office and down a flight of stairs because he had undertaken to suggest that which should be done with the timber in jackson county by this summary proceeding farrar lost the support of a faction o meara being a power in the state and chairman of the forestry board besides but he got rid of interference from that day forth oddly enough my friendship with farrar was an indirect result of the incident i have just related a few mornings after i was seated in my office trying to concentrate my mind on page twenty of volume ten of the records when i was surprised by o meara himself accompanied by two gentlemen whom i remembered to have seen on various witness stands o meara was handsomely dressed and his necktie made but a faint pretence of concealing the gorgeous diamond in his shirt front but his face wore an aggrieved air and his left hand was neatly bound in black and tucked into his coat he sank comfortably into my wicker chair which creaked a protest and produced two yellow spotted cigars chewing the end of one with much apparent relish and pushing the other at me his two friends remained respectfully standing i guessed at what was coming and braced myself by refusing the cigar not a great piece of self denial by the way but a case meant much to me then and i did seriously regret that o meara was not a possible client at any rate my sympathy with farrar in the late episode put him out of the question o meara cleared his throat and began gingerly to undo the handkerchief on his hand then he brought his fist down on the table so that the ink started from the stand and his cheeks shook with the effort i ll make him pay for this he shouted with an oath the other gentlemen nodded their approval while i put the inkstand in a place of safety you re a pretty bright young man mr crocker he went on a look of cunning coming into his little eyes but i guess you ain t had too many cases to object to a big one did you come here to tell me that i asked he looked me over queerly and evidently decided that i meant no effrontery i came here to get your opinion he said holding up a swollen hand but i want to tell you first that i ought to get ten thousand not a cent less that scoundrelly young upstart if you want my opinion i replied trying to speak slowly it is that mr farrar ought to get ten thousand dollars and i think that would be only a moderate reward i did not feel equal to pushing him into the street as farrar had done and i have now but a vague notion of what he said and how he got there but i remember that half an hour afterwards a man congratulated me openly in the bank that night i found a new friend although at the time i thought farrar s visit to me the accomplishment of a perfunctory courtesy to a man who had refused to take a case against him it was very characteristic of farrar not to mention this until he rose to go about half past eight he sauntered in upon me placing his hat precisely on the rack and we talked until ten which is to say that i talked and he commented his observations were apt if a trifle caustic and it is needless to add that i found them entertaining as he was leaving he held out his hand i hear that o meara called on you to day he said diffidently yes i answered smiling i was sorry not to have been able to take his case i sat up for an hour or more trying to arrive at some conclusion about farrar but at length i gave it up his visit had in it something impulsive which i could not reconcile with his manner he surely owed me nothing for refusing a case against him and must have known that my motives for so doing were not personal but if i did not understand him i liked him decidedly from that night forward and i hoped that his advances had sprung from some other motive than politeness and indeed we gradually drifted into a quasi friendship it became his habit as he went out in the morning to drop into my room for a match and i returned the compliment by borrowing his coal oil when mine was out at such times we would sit or more frequently stand discussing the affairs of the town and of the nation for politics was an easy and attractive subject to us both it was only in a general way that we touched upon each other s concerns this being dangerous ground with farrar who was ever ready to close up at anything resembling a confidence as for me i hope i am not curious but i own to having had a curiosity about farrar s philadelphia patron to whom farrar made but slight allusions his very name farquhar fenelon cooke had an odd sound which somehow betokened an odd man and there was more than one bit of gossip afloat in the town of which he was the subject notwithstanding the fact

in the lapse of years and was already so to me as i pictured the catastrophe out of dusk and solitude it was from a platform raised over the naked island of the cliff in the middle of the cataract that sam patch took his last leap and alighted in the other world strange as it may appear that any uncertainty should rest upon his fate which was consummated in the sight of thousands many will tell you that the illustrious patch concealed himself in a cave under the falls and has continued to enjoy posthumous renown without foregoing the comforts of this present life but the poor fellow prized the shout of the multitude too much not to have claimed it at the instant had he survived he will not be seen again unless his ghost in such a twilight as when i was there should emerge from the foam and vanish among the shadows that fall from cliff to cliff how stern a moral may be drawn from the story of poor sam patch why do we call him a madman or a fool when he has left his memory around the falls of the genesee more permanently than if the letters of his name had been hewn into the forehead of the precipice was the leaper of cataracts more mad or foolish than other men who throw away life or misspend it in pursuit of empty fame and seldom so triumphantly as he that which he won is as invaluable as any except the unsought glory spreading like the rich perfume of richer fruit from various and useful deeds thus musing wise in theory but practically as great a fool as sam i lifted my eyes and beheld the spires warehouses and dwellings of rochester half a mile distant on both sides of the river indistinctly cheerful with the twinkling of many lights amid the fall of the evening the town had sprung up like a mushroom but no presage of decay could be drawn from its hasty growth its edifices are of dusky brick and of stone that will not be grayer in a hundred years than now its churches are gothic it is impossible to look at its worn pavements and conceive how lately the forest leaves have been swept away the most ancient town in massachusetts appears quite like an affair of yesterday compared with rochester its attributes of youth are the activity and eager life with which it is redundant the whole street sidewalks and centre was crowded with pedestrians horsemen stage coaches gigs light wagons and heavy ox teams all hurrying trotting rattling and rumbling in a throng that passed continually but never passed away here a country wife was selecting a churn from several gayly painted ones on the sunny sidewalk there a farmer was bartering his produce and in two or three places a crowd of people were showering bids on a vociferous auctioneer i saw a great wagon and an ox chain knocked off to a very pretty woman numerous were the lottery offices those true temples of mammon where red and yellow bills offered splendid fortunes to the world at large and banners of painted cloth gave notice that the lottery draws next wednesday at the ringing of a bell judges jurymen lawyers and clients elbowed each other to the court house to busy themselves with cases that would doubtless illustrate the state of society had i the means of reporting them the number of public houses benefited the flow of temporary population some were farmer s taverns cheap homely and comfortable others were magnificent hotels with negro waiters gentlemanly landlords in black broad cloth and foppish bar keepers in broadway coats with chased gold watches in their waistcoat pockets i caught one of these fellows quizzing me through an eye glass the porters were lumbering up the steps with baggage from the packet boats while waiters plied the brush on dusty travellers who meanwhile glanced over the innumerable advertisements in the daily papers in short everybody seemed to be there and all had something to do and were doing it with all their might except a party of drunken recruits for the western military posts principally irish and scotch though they wore uncle sam s gray jacket and trousers i noticed one other idle man he carried a rifle on his shoulder and a powder horn across his breast and appeared to stare about him with confused wonder as if while he was listening to the wind among the forest boughs the hum and bustle of an instantaneous city had surrounded him iii a night scene the steamboat in which i was passenger for detroit had put into the mouth of a small river where the greater part of the night would be spent in repairing some damages of the machinery as the evening was warm though cloudy and very dark i stood on deck watching a scene that would not have attracted a second glance in the daytime but became picturesque by the magic of strong light and deep shade some wild irishmen were replenishing our stock of wood and had kindled a great fire on the bank to illuminate their labors it was composed of large logs and dry brushwood heaped together with careless profusion blazing fiercely spouting showers of sparks into the darkness and gleaming wide over lake erie a beacon for perplexed voyagers leagues from land all around and above the furnace there was total obscurity no trees or other objects caught and reflected any portion of the brightness which thus wasted itself in the immense void of night as if it quivered from the expiring embers of the world after the final conflagration but the irishmen were continually emerging from the dense gloom passing through the lurid glow and vanishing into the gloom on the other side sometimes a whole figure would be made visible by the shirtsleeves and light colored dress others

you he said she s got to give me some candy then rejoined his young interlocutor i can t get any candy here any american candy american candy s the best candy and are american little boys the best little boys asked winterbourne i don t know i m an american boy said the child i see you are one of the best laughed winterbourne are you an american man pursued this vivacious infant and then on winterbourne s affirmative reply american men are the best he declared his companion thanked him for the compliment and the child who had now got astride of his alpenstock stood looking about him while he attacked a second lump of sugar winterbourne wondered if he himself had been like this in his infancy for he had been brought to europe at about this age here comes my sister cried the child in a moment she s an american girl winterbourne looked along the path and saw a beautiful young lady advancing american girls are the best girls he said cheerfully to his young companion my sister ain t the best the child declared she s always blowing at me i imagine that is your fault not hers said winterbourne the young lady meanwhile had drawn near she was dressed in white muslin with a hundred frills and flounces and knots of pale colored ribbon she was bareheaded but she balanced in her hand a large parasol with a deep border of embroidery and she was strikingly admirably pretty how pretty they are thought winterbourne straightening himself in his seat as if he were prepared to rise the young lady paused in front of his bench near the parapet of the garden which overlooked the lake the little boy had now converted his alpenstock into a vaulting pole by the aid of which he was springing about in the gravel and kicking it up not a little randolph said the young lady what are you doing i m going up the alps replied randolph this is the way and he gave another little jump scattering the pebbles about winterbourne s ears that s the way they come down said winterbourne he s an american man cried randolph in his little hard voice the young lady gave no heed to this announcement but looked straight at her brother well i guess you had better be quiet she simply observed it seemed to winterbourne that he had been in a manner presented he got up and stepped slowly toward the young girl throwing away his cigarette this little boy and i have made acquaintance he said with great civility in geneva as he had been perfectly aware a young man was not at liberty to speak to a young unmarried lady except under certain rarely occurring conditions but here at vevey what conditions could be better than these a pretty american girl coming and standing in front of you in a garden this pretty american girl however on hearing winterbourne s observation simply glanced at him she then turned her head and looked over the parapet at the lake and the opposite mountains he wondered whether he had gone too far but he decided that he must advance farther rather than retreat while he was thinking of something else to say the young lady turned to the little boy again i should like to know where you got that pole she said i bought it responded randolph you don t mean to say you re going to take it to italy yes i am going to take it to italy the child declared the young girl glanced over the front of her dress and smoothed out a knot or two of ribbon then she rested her eyes upon the prospect again well i guess you had better leave it somewhere she said after a moment are you going to italy winterbourne inquired in a tone of great respect the young lady glanced at him again yes sir she replied and she said nothing more are you a going over the simplon winterbourne pursued a little embarrassed i don t know she said i suppose it s some mountain randolph what mountain are we going over going where the child demanded to italy winterbourne explained i don t know said randolph i don t want to go to italy i want to go to america oh italy is a beautiful place rejoined the young man can you get candy there randolph loudly inquired i hope not said his sister i guess you have had enough candy and mother thinks so too i haven t had any for ever so long for a hundred weeks cried the boy still jumping about the young lady inspected her flounces and smoothed her ribbons again and winterbourne presently risked an observation upon the beauty of the view he was ceasing to be embarrassed for he had begun to perceive that she was not in the least embarrassed herself there had not been the slightest alteration in her charming complexion she was evidently neither offended nor flattered if she looked another way when he spoke to her and seemed not particularly to hear him this was simply her habit her manner yet as he talked a little more and pointed out some of the objects of interest in the view with which she appeared quite unacquainted she gradually gave him more of the benefit of her glance and then he saw that this glance was perfectly direct and unshrinking it was not however what would have been called an immodest glance for the young girl s eyes were singularly honest and fresh they were wonderfully pretty eyes and indeed winterbourne had not seen for a long time anything prettier than his fair countrywoman s various features her complexion her nose her ears her teeth he had a great relish for feminine beauty he was addicted to observing and analyzing it and as regards this young lady s face he made several observations it was not at all insipid but it was not exactly expressive and though it was eminently delicate winterbourne mentally accused it

innumerable energies which have long been silently agitating the souls of nations in their profoundest depths thus every great man may be regarded as possessing two distinct lines of ancestry physical and spiritual each of which separately demands elucidation he owes much in one way to his father and his mother his grandfathers and his grandmothers and his remoter progenitors from some or all of whom he derives in varying degrees and combinations the personal qualities whose special interaction constitutes his greatness and his idiosyncrasy he owes much in another way to his intellectual and moral ancestors the thinkers and workers who have preceded him in his own department of thought or action and have made possible in the course of ages the final development of his special revolution or his particular system viewed as an individual he is what he is with all his powers and faculties and potentialities in virtue of the brain the frame the temperament the energy he inherits directly from his actual ancestors paternal and maternal viewed as a factor or element in a great movement he is what he is because the movement had succeeded in reaching such and such a point in its progress already without him and waited only for such and such a grand and commanding personality in order to carry it yet a step further on its course of development no man who ever lived would more cordially have recognised these two alternative aspects of the great worker s predetermining causes than charles darwin he knew well that the individual is the direct cumulative product of his physical predecessors and that he works and is worked upon in innumerable ways by the particular environment into whose midst he is born let us see then in his own case what were these two main sets of conditioning circumstances which finally led up to the joint production of charles darwin the man and the philosopher the thinking brain and the moving energy in other words what was the state of the science of life at the time when he first began to observe and to speculate and what was the ancestry which made him be born a person capable of helping it forward at a single bound over its great restricting dogmatic barrier of the fixity of species let us begin in the first place by clearing the path beforehand of a popular misconception so extremely general and almost universal that unless it be got rid of at the very outset of our sketch much of the real scope and purport of darwin s life and work must of necessity remain entirely misunderstood by the vast mass of english readers in the public mind darwin is perhaps most commonly regarded as the discoverer and founder of the evolution hypothesis two ideas are usually associated with his name and memory it is believed that he was the first propounder of the theory which supposes all plant and animal forms to be the result not of special creation but of slow modification in pre existent organisms it is further and more particularly believed that he was the first propounder of the theory which supposes the descent of man to be traceable from a remote and more or less monkey like ancestor now as a matter of fact darwin was not the prime originator of either of these two great cardinal ideas though he held both as part of his organised theory of things he was not by any means the first or the earliest thinker to hold them or to propound them publicly though he gained for them both a far wider and more general acceptance than they had ever before popularly received he laid no sort of claim himself to originality or proprietorship in either theory the grand idea which he did really originate was not the idea of descent with modification but the idea of natural selection by which agency as he was the first to prove definite kinds of plants and animals have been slowly evolved from simpler forms with definite adaptations to the special circumstances by which they are surrounded in a word it was the peculiar glory of charles darwin not to have suggested that all the variety of animal and vegetable life might have been produced by slow modifications in one or more original types but to have shown the nature of the machinery by which such a result could be actually attained in the practical working out of natural causes he did not invent the development theory but he made it believable and comprehensible he was not as most people falsely imagine the moses of evolutionism the prime mover in the biological revolution he was the joshua who led the world of thinkers and workers into full fruition of that promised land which earlier investigators had but dimly descried from the pisgah top of conjectural speculation how far darwin s special idea of natural selection supplemented and rendered credible the earlier idea of descent with modification we shall see more fully when we come to treat of the inception and growth of his great epoch making work the origin of species for the present it must suffice to point out that in the world into which he was born the theory of evolution already existed in a more or less shadowy and undeveloped shape and since it was his task in life to raise this theory from the rank of a mere plausible and happy guess to the rank of a highly elaborate and almost universally accepted biological system we may pause awhile to consider on the threshold what was the actual state of natural science at the moment when the great directing and organising intelligence of charles darwin first appeared from time immemorial in modern christendom at least it had been the general opinion of learned and simple alike that every species of plant or animal owed its present form and its original existence to a distinct act of special creation this na f belief unsupported as it was by any sort of internal evidence was supposed to rest directly upon the expre

open and develop a little flesh and muscle to mr wilberfloss the sentence was almost equivalent to penal servitude it was with tears in his voice that he was giving his final instructions to his sub editor in whose charge the paper would be left during his absence he had taken a long time doing this for two days he had been fussing in and out of the office to the discontent of its inmates more especially billy windsor the sub editor who was now listening moodily to the last harangue of the series with the air of one whose heart is not in the subject billy windsor was a tall wiry loose jointed young man with unkempt hair and the general demeanour of a caged eagle looking at him one could picture him astride of a bronco rounding up cattle or cooking his dinner at a camp fire somehow he did not seem to fit into the cosy moments atmosphere well i think that that is all mr windsor chirruped the editor he was a little man with a long neck and large pince nez and he always chirruped you understand the general lines on which i think the paper should be conducted the sub editor nodded mr wilberfloss made him tired sometimes he made him more tired than at other times at the present moment he filled him with an aching weariness the editor meant well and was full of zeal but he had a habit of covering and recovering the ground he possessed the art of saying the same obvious thing in a number of different ways to a degree which is found usually only in politicians if mr wilberfloss had been a politician he would have been one of those dealers in glittering generalities who used to be fashionable in american politics there is just one thing he continued mrs julia burdett parslow is a little inclined i may have mentioned this before you did said the sub editor mr wilberfloss chirruped on unchecked a little inclined to be late with her moments with budding girlhood if this should happen while i am away just write her a letter quite a pleasant letter you understand pointing out the necessity of being in good time the machinery of a weekly paper of course cannot run smoothly unless contributors are in good time with their copy she is a very sensible woman and she will understand i am sure if you point it out to her the sub editor nodded and there is just one other thing i wish you would correct a slight tendency i have noticed lately in mr asher to be just a trifle well not precisely risky but perhaps a shade broad in his humour his what said billy windsor mr asher is a very sensible man and he will be the first to acknowledge that his sense of humour has led him just a little beyond the bounds you understand well that is all i think now i must really be going or i shall miss my train good bye mr windsor good bye said the sub editor thankfully at the door

once more informing jim that he is a liar and a skunk and whose editor works with a revolver on his desk and another in his hip pocket graduating from this he had proceeded to a reporter s post on a

dream of reaching new york at last after four years on the kentucky paper he had come east minus the lobe of one ear and plus a long scar that ran diagonally across his left shoulder and had worked

unless he is favoured by fortune things had not come billy windsor s way his work had been confined to turning in reports of fires and small street accidents which the various papers to which he supplied them cut down to a couple of inches billy had been in a bad way when he had happened upon the sub editorship of cosy moments he despised the work with all his heart and the salary was infinitesimal but it was regular and for a while billy felt that a regular salary was the greatest thing on earth but he still dreamed of winning through to a post on one of the big new york dailies where there was something doing and a man would have a chance of showing what was in him the unfortunate thing however was that cosy moments took up his time so completely he had no chance of attracting the notice of big editors by his present work and he had no leisure for doing any other all of which may go to explain why his normal aspect was that of a caged eagle to him brooding over

that their society was not particularly required strolled off to the stables where ned entered into a conversation with the syces as to the distance to meanwerrie and the direction in which that village lay like all anglo indian children brought up in india the boys had when they left india spoken the language fluently they had almost entirely forgotten it during their stay in england but it speedily came back again and ned at the end of three months work found that he could get on very fairly dick had lost it altogether when they went back to the veranda they found that the girls had gone indoors and that their father was sitting and smoking with his brother officers when the lads came up the conversation ceased and then the major said it is as well the boys should know what is

by that window sir said the little old woman intimately and was nearly shutting the door between them and all the beginnings of this story but the voice of the gentleman arrested and wedged open the closing door i are you looking at the house he said i say just a moment mrs rabbit he came down the length of the room with a slight flicking noise due to the scandalized excitement of his abandoned laces the lady was reminded of her not so very distant schooldays when it would have been considered a suitable answer to such a question as his to reply no i am walking down piccadilly on my hands but instead she waved that pink paper again the agents she said recommended specially so sorry if i intrude i ought i know to have written first but i came on an impulse by this time the gentleman in the artistic tie who had also the artistic eye for such matters had discovered that the lady was young delightfully slender either pretty or beautiful he could scarcely tell which and very very well dressed i am glad he said with remarkable decision that i was not out i will show you the house ow can you sir intervened the little old woman oh show a house why not the kitchings you don t understand the range sir it s beyond you and upstairs you can t show a lady upstairs the gentleman reflected upon these difficulties well i m going to show her all i can show her anyhow and after that mrs rabbit you shall come in you needn t wait i m thinking said mrs rabbit folding stiff little arms and regarding him sternly you won t be much good after tea you know if you don t get your afternoon s exercise rendez vous in the kitchen mrs rabbit said mr brumley firmly and mrs rabbit after a moment of mute struggle disappeared discontentedly i do not want to be the least bit a bother said the lady i m intruding i know without the least bit of notice i do hope i m not disturbing you she seemed to make an effort to stop at that and failed and added the least bit do please tell me if i am not at all said mr brumley i hate my afternoon s walk as a prisoner hates the treadmill she s such a nice old creature she s been a mother and several aunts to us ever since my wife died she was the first servant we ever had all this house he explained to his visitor s questioning eyes was my wife s creation it was a little featureless agent s house on the edge of these pine woods she saw something in the shape of the rooms and that central hall we ve enlarged it of course twice this was two rooms that is why there is a step down in the centre that window and window seat that was her addition said mr brumley all this room is replete with her personality he hesitated and explained further when we prepared this house we expected to be better off than we subsequently became and she could let herself go much is from holland and italy and that beautiful old writing desk with the little single rose in a glass she put it there she even in a sense put the flower there it is renewed of course by mrs rabbit she trained mrs rabbit he sighed slightly apparently at some thought of mrs rabbit you you write the lady stopped and then diverted a question that she perhaps considered too blunt there largely i am a sort of author perhaps you know my books not very important books but people sometimes read them the rose pink of the lady s cheek deepened by a shade within her pretty head her mind rushed to and fro saying brumley brumley then she had a saving gleam are you george brumley she asked the george brumley my name is george brumley he said with a proud modesty perhaps you know my little euphemia books they are still the most read the lady made a faint dishonest assent like noise and her rose pink deepened another shade but her interlocutor was not watching her very closely just then euphemia was my wife he said at least my wife gave her to me a kind of exhalation this his voice fell with a genuine respect for literary associations was euphemia s home i still he continued go on i go on writing about euphemia i have to in this house with my tradition but it is becoming painful painful curiously more painful now than at the beginning and i want to go i want at last to make a break that is why i am letting or selling the house there will be no more euphemia his voice fell to silence the lady surveyed the long low clear room so cleverly prepared for life with its white wall its dutch clock its dutch dresser its pretty seats about the open fireplace its cleverly placed bureau its sun trap at the garden end she could feel the rich intention of living in its every arrangement and a sense of uncertainty in things struck home to her she seemed to see a woman a woman like herself only very very much cleverer flitting about the r

and that in time a few flocks of wandering sheep would scarce be able to find herbage growing on the wastes of land which would take the place of this fertile soil certainly no such thought as this occurred to martha as she re entered the house though she did fear that trouble and ruin might be approaching john was soon at work among the fig trees aiding isaac and his son reuben a lad of some fifteen years to pick the soft luscious fruit and carry it to the little courtyard shaded from the rays of the sun by an overhead trellis work covered with vines and almost bending beneath the purple bunches of grapes miriam the old nurse and four or five maid servants under the eye of martha tied them in rows on strings and fastened them to pegs driven into that side of the house upon which the sun beat down most hotly it was only the best fruit that was so served for that which had been damaged in the picking and all of smaller size were laid on trays in the sun the girls chatted merrily as they worked for martha although a good housewife was a gentle mistress and so long as fingers were busy heeded not if the tongue ran on let the damsels be happy while they may she would say if miriam scolded a little when the laughter rose louder than usual let them be happy while they can who knows what lies in the future but at present the future cast no shade upon the group nor upon a girl of about fourteen years old who danced in and out of the courtyard in the highest spirits now stopping a few minutes to string the figs then scampering away with an empty basket which when she reached the gatherers she placed on her head and supported demurely for a little while at the foot of the ladder upon which john was perched so that he could lay the figs in it without bruising them but long ere the basket was filled she would tire of the work and setting it on the ground run back into the house and so you think you are helping mary john said laughing when the girl returned for the fourth time with an empty basket helping john of course i am ever so much helping you and helping them at the house and carrying empty baskets i consider myself the most active of the party active certainly mary but if you do not help them in stringing and hanging the figs more than you help me i think you might as well leave it alone fie john that is most ungrateful after my standing here like a statue with the basket on my head ready for you to lay the figs in that is all very fine john laughed but before the basket is half full away you go and i have to get down the ladder and bring up the basket and fix it firmly and that without shaking the figs whereas had you left it alone altogether i could have brought up the empty basket and fixed it close by my hand without any trouble at all you are an ungrateful boy and you know how bad it is to be ungrateful and after my making myself so hot too miriam said my face is as red as fire and that is all the thanks i get very well then i shall go into the house and leave you to your own bad reflections you need not do that mary you can sit down in the shade there and watch us at work and eat figs and get yourself cool all at the same time the sun will be down in another half hour and then i shall be free to amuse you amuse me indeed the girl said indignantly as she sat down on the bank to which john had pointed you mean that i shall amuse you that is what it generally comes to if it wasn t for me i am sure very often there would not be a word said when we are out together perhaps that is true john agreed but you see there is so much to think about and so you choose the time when you are with me to think thank you john you had better think at present and rising from the seat she had just taken she walked back to the house again regardless of john s explanations and shouts old isaac chuckled on his tree close by they are ever too sharp for us in words john the damsel is younger than you by full two years and yet she can always put you in the wrong with her tongue she puts meanings to my words which i never thought of john said and is angered or pretends to be for i never know which it is at things which she has coined out of her own mind for they had no place in mine boys wits are always slower than girls the old man said a girl has more fancy in her little finger than a boy in his whole body your cousin laughs at you because she sees that you take it all seriously and wonders in her mind how it is her thoughts run ahead of yours but i love the damsel and so do all in the house for if she be a little wayward at times she is bright and loving and has cheered the house since she came here your father is not a man of many words and martha as becomes her age is staid and quiet though she is no enemy

you have done feasting them you will send them to me to be cured smith yes and when you ve done curing them you ll send them to me to be buried doctor after a pause laughing well you have all the old doctrines it is only fair you should have all the old jokes too smith laughing also by the way you call it a conjuring trick that poor people should drink moderately doctor i call it a chemical discovery that alcohol is not a food smith you don t drink wine yourself doctor mildly startled drink wine well what else is there to drink smith so drinking decently is a conjuring trick that you can do anyhow doctor still good humouredly well well let us hope so talking about conjuring tricks there is to be conjuring and all kinds of things here this afternoon smith conjuring indeed why is that enter hastings with a letter in each hand hastings his grace will be with you presently he asked me to deal with the business matter first of all he gives a note to each of them smith turning eagerly to the doctor but this is rather splendid the duke s given to the new public house hastings the duke is very liberal collects papers doctor examining his cheque very but this is rather curious he has also given to the league for opposing the new public house hastings the duke is very liberal minded exit smith staring at his cheque liberal minded absent minded i should call it doctor sitting down and lighting a cigar well yes the duke does suffer a little from absence puts his cigar in his mouth and pulls during the pause of mind he is all for compromise don t you know the kind of man who when you talk to him about the five best breeds of dog always ends up by buying a mongrel the duke is the kindest of men and always trying to please everybody he generally finishes by pleasing nobody smith yes i think i know the sort of thing doctor take this conjuring for instance you know the duke has two wards who are to live with him now smith yes i heard something about a nephew and niece from ireland doctor the niece came from ireland some months ago but the nephew comes back from america to night he gets up abruptly and walks about the room i think i will tell you all about it in spite of your precious public house you seem to me to be a sane man and i fancy i shall want all the sane men i can get to night smith rising also i am at your service do you know i rather guessed you did not come here only to protest against my precious public house doctor striding about in subdued excitement well you guessed right i was family physician to the duke s brother in ireland i knew the family pretty well smith quietly i suppose you mean you knew something odd about the family doctor well they saw fairies and things of that sort smith and i suppose to the medical mind seeing fairies means much the same as seeing snakes doctor with a sour smile well they saw them in ireland i suppose it s quite correct to see fairies in ireland it s like gambling at monte carlo it s quite respectable but i do draw the line at their seeing fairies in england i do object to their bringing their ghosts and goblins and witches into the poor duke s own back garden and within a yard of my own red lamp it shows a lack of tact smith but i do understand that the duke s nephew and niece see witches and fairies between here and your lamp he walks to the garden window and looks out doctor well the nephew has been in america it stands to reason you can t see fairies in america but there is this sort of superstition in the family and i am not easy in my mind about the girl smith why what does she do doctor oh she wanders about the park and the woods in the evenings damp evenings for choice she calls it the celtic twilight i ve no use for the celtic twilight myself it has a tendency to get on the chest but what is worse she is always talking about meeting somebody some elf or wizard or something i don t like it at all smith have you told the duke doctor with a grim smile oh yes i told the duke the result was the conjurer smith with amazement the conjurer doctor puts down his cigar in the ash tray the duke is indescribable he will be here presently and you shall judge for yourself put two or three facts or ideas before him and the thing he makes out of them is always something that seems to have nothing to do with it tell any other human being about a girl dreaming of the fairies and her practical brother from america and he would settle it in some obvious way and satisfy some one send her to america or let her have her fairies in ireland now the duke thinks a conjurer would just meet the case i suppose he vaguely thinks it would brighten things up and somehow satisfy the believers interest in supernatural things and the unbelievers interest in smart things as a matter of fact the unbeliever thinks the conjurer s a fraud and the believer thinks he s a fraud too the conjurer satisfies nobody that is why he satisfies the duke enter the duke with hastings carrying papers the duke

ears when scarcely a dozen yards away from the car stopped short and suddenly bolted out on the open moor there was the sound of a heavy whip a loud masterful voice and a very brief struggle during which the horse once plunged and reared so high that louise watching cried out in fear a few moments later however horse and rider the former quivering and subdued were beside the car has anything happened the newcomer asked raising his whip to his hat he addressed louise instinctively conscious even in that dim light that she was the person in authority she did not at once reply her eyes were fixed upon the face of her questioner there was little enough of him to be seen yet she was aware of an exceptional interest in his dimly revealed personality he was young unusually tall and his voice was cultivated beyond that she could see or divine nothing he for his part with his attention still largely engaged in keeping his horse under control yet knew in those first few moments that he was looking into the face of a woman who had no kinship with the world in which he had been born and had lived his days those were fugitive thoughts which passed between them only half conceived yet strong enough to remain as first and unforgettable impressions then the commonplace interests of the situation became insistent i have broken down louise said my chauffeur tells me that it will take hours to effect some necessary repair to the car and meanwhile here we are you couldn t have chosen a worse place for a breakdown the young man observed you are miles away from anywhere you are indeed a comforter louise murmured do you think that you could possibly get down and advise us what to do you look so far away up there there was another brief struggle between the man and his still frightened horse then the former swung himself down and with the bridle through his arm came and stood by the car if there is any way in which i can help he ventured i am quite at your service louise smiled at him she remained unoppressed by any fear of inconvenience or hardship she had the air of one rather enjoying her plight well you have begun very nicely by doing what i asked you she said really you know to an impressionable person there was something rather terrifying about you when you appeared suddenly from out of the shadows in such a lonely place i was beginning to wonder whether you were altogether real whether one of those black hills there had not opened to let you out you see i know something of the legends of your country although i have never been here before the young man was less at his ease he stood tapping his boot nervously with his long riding whip i am sorry if i frightened you he said my horse is a little restive and the acetylene light which your chauffeur turned on him was sufficiently alarming you did not exactly frighten me she assured him but you looked so abnormally large please tell us what you would advise us to do is there a village near or an inn or even a barn or shall we have to spend the night in the car the nearest village he replied is twelve miles away fortunately my own home is close by i shall be very pleased i and my brother if you will honor us i am afraid i cannot offer you very much in the way of entertainment she rose briskly to her feet and beamed upon him you are indeed a good samaritan she exclaimed a roof is more than we had dared to hope for although when one looks up at this wonderful sky and breathes this air one wonders perhaps whether a roof after all is such a blessing it gets very cold toward morning the young man said practically of course she assented aline you will bring my dressing bag and follow us this gentleman is kind enough to offer us shelter for the night dear me you really are almost as tall as you appeared she added as she stood by his side for the first time in my life you make me feel undersized he looked down at her a little more at his ease now by reason of the friendliness of her manner although he had still the air of one embarked upon an adventure the outcome of which was to be regarded with some qualms she was of little more than medium height and his first impressions of her were that she was thin and too pale to be good looking that her eyes were large and soft with eyebrows more clearly defined than is usual among englishwomen and that she moved without seeming to walk i suppose i am tall he admitted as they started off along the road one doesn t notice it around here my name is john strangewey and our house is just behind that clump of trees there on the top of the hill we will do our best to make you comfortable he added a little doubtfully but there are only my brother and myself and we have no women servants in the house a roof of any sort will be a luxury she assured him i only hope that we shall not be a trouble to you in any way and your name please he asked she was a little amazed at his directness but she answered him without hesitation my name she told him is louise he leaned down toward her a little puzzled louise but your surname she laughed softly it occurred to him that nothing like her laugh had ever been heard on that gray walled stretch of mountain road never mind i am traveling incognito who i am or where i am going well what does that matter to anybody perhaps i do not know myself you can imagine if you

jolly supper and then tommy i ll show you how the real foundation of the eddystun was laid the building to which john potter referred and of which he gave a graphic account and made a careful drawing that night for the benefit of his hopeful son was the first lighthouse that was built on the wild and almost submerged reef of rocks lying about fourteen miles to the south west of plymouth harbour the highest part of this reef named the eddystone is only a few feet above water at high tide and as it lies in deep water exposed to the full swell of the ocean the raging of the sea over it in stormy weather is terrible beyond conception lying as it does in the track of vessels coasting up and down the english channel it was as we may easily believe a source of terror as well as of danger to mariners until a lighthouse was built upon it but a lighthouse was talked of long before any attempt was made to erect one important though this object was to the navies of the world the supposed impossibility of the feat and the danger apprehended in the mere attempt deterred any one from undertaking the task until the year when a country gentleman of essex named henry winstanley came forward and having obtained the necessary legal powers began the great work of building on the wave lashed rock winstanley was an eccentric as well as a bold man he undoubtedly possessed an ingenious mechanical mind which displayed itself very much in practical joking it is said of him that he made a machine the spring of which was attached to an old slipper which lay apparently by chance on the floor of his bedroom if a visitor kicked this out of his way a phantom instantly arose from the floor he also constructed a chair which seized every one who sat down in it with its arms and held them fast and in his garden he had an arbour which went afloat in a neighbouring canal when any one entered it as might have been expected winstanley s lighthouse was a curious affair not well adapted to withstand the fury of the waves it was highly ornamented and resembled a chinese pagoda much more than a lighthouse nevertheless it must be said to the credit of this bold man that after facing and overcoming during six years difficulties and dangers which up to that time had not been heard of he finished his lighthouse proved hereby the possibility of that which had been previously deemed impossible and gave to mankind a noble example of enterprise daring and perseverance our friend john potter had from the commencement rendered able assistance in the dangerous work as a stone cutter and he could not help feeling as if he had been deserted by an old friend that night when the boat went off to the rock without him it was in november when winstanley expressed the wish that he might experience in his lighthouse the greatest storm that ever blew on the th of that month his wish was granted that night there arose one of the fiercest gales that ever strewed our shores with wrecks

was a grandson of solomon the mighty king of israel and born of a royal mother a princess of egypt in stature aziel was tall but somewhat slimly made having small bones his face was oval in shape the features especially the mouth being fine and sensitive the eyes were large dark and full of thought the eyes of a man with a destiny for the most part indeed they were sombre and over full of thought but at times they could light up with a strange fire aziel the prince placed his hand against his forehead in such fashion as to shade his face from the rays of the setting sun and from beneath its shadow gazed long and earnestly at the city of the hill at length i behold thee thanks be to god he murmured for he was a worshipper of jehovah and not of his mother s deities and it is time since to speak the truth i am weary of this travelling now what fortune shall i find within thy walls o city of gold and devil servers who can tell said a quiet voice at his elbow perhaps prince you will find a wife or a throne or a grave aziel started and turned to see a man standing at his side clothed in robes that had been rich but were now torn and stained with travel and wearing on his head a black cap in shape not unlike the fez that is common in the east to day the man was past middle age having a grizzled beard sharp hard features and quick eyes which withal were not unkindly he was a phoenician merchant much trusted by hiram the king of tyre who had made him captain of the merchandise of this expedition ah is it you metem said aziel why do you leave your charge to return to me that i may guard a more precious charge yourself prince replied the merchant courteously having brought the child of israel so far in safety i desire to hand him safely to the governor of yonder city your servants told me that by your command they had left you alone so i returned to bear you company for after nightfall robbers and savages wander without these walls i thank you for your care metem though i think there is little danger and at the worst i can defend myself do not thank me prince i am a merchant and now as in the past i protect you knowing that for it i shall be paid the governor will give me a rich reward when i lead you to him safely and when in years to come i return with you still safe to the court of jerusalem then the great king will fill my ship s hold with gifts that depends metem replied the prince if my grandfather still reigns it may be so but he is very old and if my uncle wears his crown then i am not sure truly you phoenicians love money would you then sell me for gold also metem i said not so prince though even friendship has its price among your people metem among all people prince you reproach us with loving money well we do since money gives everything for which men strive honour and place and comfort and the friendship of kings it cannot give you love metem the phoenician laughed contemptuously love with gold i will buy as much of it as i need are there no slaves upon the market and no free women who desire ornaments and ease and the purple of tyre you are young prince to say that gold cannot buy us love and you metem who are growing old do not understand what i mean by love nor will i stay to explain it to you for were my words as wise as solomon s still you would not understand at the least your money cannot bring you the blessing of heaven nor the welfare of your spirit in the eternal life that is to come the welfare of my spirit prince no it cannot since i do not believe that i have a spirit when i die i die and there is an end but the blessing of heaven ah that can be bought as i have proved once and again if not with gold then otherwise did i not in bygone years pass the first son of my manhood through the fire to baal sidon nay shrink not from me it cost me dear but my fortune was a

birch tree in the morning they returned to boston and sewell s parish duties began again he was rather faithfuller and busier in these than he might have been if he had not laid so much stress upon duties of all sorts and so little upon beliefs he declared that he envied the ministers of the good old times who had only to teach their people that they would be lost if they did not do right it was much simpler than to make them understand that they were often to be good for reasons not immediately connected with their present or future comfort and that they could not confidently expect to be lost for any given transgression or even to be lost at all he found it necessary to do his work largely in a personal way by meeting and talking with people and this took up a great deal of his time especially after the summer vacation when he had to get into relations with them anew and to help them recover themselves from the moral lassitude into which people fall during that season of physical recuperation he was occupied with these matters one morning late in october when a letter came addressed in a handwriting of copybook carefulness but showing in every painstaking stroke the writer s want of training which when he read it filled sewell with dismay it was a letter from lemuel barker whom sewell remembered with a pang of self upbraiding as the poor fellow he had visited with his wife the evening before they left willoughby pastures and it enclosed passages of a long poem which barker said he had written since he got the fall work done the passages were not submitted for sewell s criticism but were offered as examples of the character of the whole poem for which the author wished to find a publisher they were not without ideas of a didactic and satirical sort but they seemed so wanting in literary art beyond a mechanical facility of versification that sewell wondered how the writer should have mastered the notion of anything so literary as publication till he came to that part of the letter in which barker spoke of their having had so much sickness in the family that he thought he would try to do something to help along the avowal of this meritorious ambition inflicted another wound upon sewell s guilty consciousness but what made his blood run cold was barker s proposal to come down to boston if sewell advised and find a publisher with sewell s assistance this would never do and the minister went to his desk with the intention of despatching a note of prompt and total discouragement but in crossing the room from the chair into which he had sunk with a cheerful curiosity to read the letter he could not help some natural rebellion against the punishment visited upon him he could not deny that he deserved punishment but he thought that this to say the least was very ill timed he had often warned other sinners who came to him in like resentment that it was this very quality of inopportuneness that was perhaps the most sanative and divine property of retribution the eternal justice fell upon us he said at the very moment when we were least able to bear it or thought ourselves so but now in his own case the clear sighted prophet cried out and revolted in his heart it was saturday morning when every minute was precious to him for his sermon and it would take him fully an hour to write that letter it must be done with the greatest sympathy he had seen that this poor foolish boy was very sensitive and yet it must be done with such thoroughness as to cut off all hope of anything like literary achievement for him at the moment sewell reached his desk with a spirit disciplined to the sacrifice required of it he heard his wife s step outside his study door and he had just time to pull open a drawer throw the letter into it and shut it again before she entered he did not mean finally to conceal it from her but he was willing to give himself breath before he faced her with the fact that he had received such a letter nothing in its way was more terrible to this good man than the righteousness of that good woman in their case as in that of most other couples who cherish an ideal of dutiful living she was the custodian of their potential virtue and he was the instrument often faltering and imperfect of its application to circumstances and without wishing to spare himself too much he was sometimes aware that she did not spare him enough she worked his moral forces as mercilessly as a woman uses the physical strength of a man when it is placed at her direction what is the matter david she asked with a keen glance at the face he turned upon her over his shoulder nothing that i wish to talk of at present my dear answered sewell with a boldness that he knew would not avail him if she persisted in knowing well there would be no time if you did said his wife i m dreadfully sorry for you david but it s really a case you can t refuse their own minister is taken sick and it s appointed for this afternoon at two o

the room which she did after praising him and pitying him in a way that was always very sweet to him he saw that he must begin his sermon at once if he meant to get through with it in time and must put off all hope of replying to lemuel barker till monday at least but he chose quite a different theme from that on which he had intended to preach by an immediate inspiration he wrote a sermon on

owners a politician he was naturally an original secessionist and ardently devoted to the southern cause circumstances of an imperious nature which it is unnecessary to relate here had prevented him from taking service with that gallant army which had fought the disastrous campaigns ending with the fall of corinth and he chafed under the inglorious restraint longing for the release of his energies the larger life of the soldier the opportunity for distinction that opportunity he felt would come as it comes to all in wartime meanwhile he did what he could no service was too humble for him to perform in the aid of the south no adventure to perilous for him to undertake if consistent with the character of a civilian who was at heart a soldier and who in good faith and without too much qualification assented to at least a part of the frankly villainous dictum that all is fair in love and war one evening while farquhar and his wife were sitting on a rustic bench near the entrance to his grounds a gray clad soldier rode up to the gate and asked for a drink of water mrs farquhar was only too happy to serve him with her own white hands while she was fetching the water her husband approached the dusty horseman and inquired eagerly for news from the front the yanks are repairing the railroads said the man and are getting ready for another advance they have reached the owl creek bridge put it in order and built a stockade on the north bank the commandant has issued an order which is posted everywhere declaring that any civilian caught interfering with the railroad its bridges tunnels or trains will be summarily hanged i saw the order how far is it to the owl creek bridge farquhar asked about thirty miles is there no force on this side of the creek only a picket post half a mile out on the railroad and a single sentinel at this end of the bridge suppose a man a civilian and student of hanging should elude the picket post and perhaps get the better of the sentinel said farquhar smiling what could he accomplish the soldier reflected i was there a month ago he replied i observed that the flood of last winter had lodged a great quantity of driftwood against the wooden pier at this end of the bridge it is now dry and would burn like tinder the lady had now brought the water which the soldier drank he thanked her ceremoniously bowed to her husband and rode away an hour later after nightfall he repassed the plantation going northward in the direction from which he had come he was a federal scout iii as peyton farquhar fell straight downward through the bridge he lost consciousness and was as one already dead from this state he was awakened ages later it seemed to him by the pain of a sharp pressure upon his throat followed by a sense of suffocation keen poignant agonies seemed to shoot from his neck downward through every fiber of his body and limbs these pains appeared to flash along well defined lines of ramification and to beat with an inconceivably rapid periodicity they seemed like streams of pulsating fire heating him to an intolerable temperature as to his head he was conscious of nothing but a feeling of fullness of congestion these sensations were unaccompanied by thought the intellectual part of his nature was already effaced he had power only to feel and feeling was torment he was conscious of motion encompassed in a luminous cloud of which he was now merely the fiery heart without material substance he swung through unthinkable arcs of oscillation like a vast pendulum then all at once with terrible suddenness the light about him shot upward with the noise of a loud splash a frightful roaring was in his ears and all was cold and dark the power of thought was restored he knew that the rope had broken and he had fallen into the stream there was no additional strangulation the noose about his neck was already suffocating him and kept the water from his lungs to die of hanging at the bottom of a river the idea seemed to him ludicrous he opened his eyes in the darkness and saw above him a gleam of light but how distant how inaccessible he was still sinking for the light became fainter and fainter until it was a mere glimmer then it began to grow and brighten and he knew that he was rising toward the surface knew it with reluctance for he was now very comfortable to be hanged and drowned he thought that is not so bad but i do not wish to be shot no i will not be shot that is not fair he was not conscious of an effort but a sharp pain in his wrist apprised him that he was trying to free his hands he gave the struggle his attention as an idler might observe the feat of a juggler without interest in the outcome what splendid effort what magnificent what superhuman strength ah that was a fine endeavor bravo the cord fell away his arms parted and floated upward the hands dimly seen on each side in the growing light he watched them with a new interest as first one and then the other pounced upon the noose at his neck they tore it away and thrust it fiercely aside its undulations resembling those of a water snake put it back put it back he thought he shouted these words to his hands for the undoing of the noose had been succeeded by the direst pang that he had yet experienced his neck ached horribly his brain was on fire his heart which had been

safely through it the doctor s daughter looked past me across the road i wish i were a man said she and could go off as i pleased as you do it must be delightfully independent i was about to remark that too much independence is not altogether delightful but she suddenly spoke you carry very little with you for a long journey and as she said this she grasped the pickets of the gate more tightly i could see the contraction of the muscles of her white hands it seemed as if she were restraining something oh this isn t all my baggage i replied i sent on a large bag to waterton i suppose i shall be there in a couple of days and then i shall forward the bag to some other place i do not suppose you have packed up any medicine among your other things she asked you don t look as if you very often needed medicine i laughed as i replied that in the course of my life i had taken but little but if your cycle starts off rolling early in the morning she said or keeps on late in the evening you ought to be able to defend yourself against malaria i do not know what sort of a country cathay may be but i should not be a bit surprised if you found it full of mists and morning vapors malaria has a fancy for strong people you know just wait here a minute please and with that she turned and ran into the house i had liked the doctor s daughter ever since i had begun to know her although at first i had found it a little hard to become acquainted with her she was the treasurer of the literary society of the village and i was its secretary we had to work together sometimes and i found her a very straightforward girl in her accounts and in every other way in about a minute she returned carrying a little pasteboard box here are some one grain quinine capsules she said they have no taste and i am quite sure that if you get into a low country it would be a good thing for you to take at least one of them every morning people may have given you all sorts of things for your journey but i do not believe any one has given you this and she handed me the box over the top of the gate i did not say that her practical little present was the only thing that anybody had given me but i thanked her very heartily and assured her that i would take one every time i thought i needed it then as it seemed proper to do so i straightened up my bicycle as if i would mount it again her fingers clutched the top of the two palings when father comes home she said he will be sorry to find that he had not a chance to bid you good bye and by the way she added quickly you know there will be one more meeting of the society did you write out any minutes for the last evening and would you like me to read them for you upon my word i exclaimed i have forgotten all about it i made some rough notes but i have written nothing well it doesn t matter in the least said she quickly i remember everything that happened and i will write the minutes and read them for you that is if you want me to i assured her that nothing would please me better and we talked a little about the minutes after which i thought i ought not to keep her standing at the gate any longer so i took leave of her and we shook hands over the gate this was the first time i had ever shaken hands with the doctor s daughter for she was a reserved girl and hitherto i had merely bowed to her as i sped away down the street and out into the open country my heart was a good deal lighter than it had been when i began my journey it was certainly pleasant to leave that village which had been my home for the greater part of a year without the feeling that there was no one in it who cared for me even to the extent of a little box of quinine capsules chapter ii a bad twist it was about the middle of the afternoon that i found myself bowling along a smooth highway bordered by trees and stretching itself almost upon a level far away into the distance had i been a scorcher here would have been a chance to do a little record breaking for i was a powerful and practised wheelman but i had no desire to be extravagant with my energies and so contented myself with rolling steadily on at a speed moderate enough to allow me to observe the country i was passing through there were not many people on the road but at some distance ahead of me i saw a woman on a wheel she was not going rapidly and i was gaining on her suddenly with no reason whatever that i could see her machine gave a twist and although she put out her foot to save herself she fell to the ground instantly i pushed forward to assist her but before i could reach her she was on her feet she made a step towards her bicycle which lay in the middle of the road and then she stopped and stood still i saw that she was hurt but i could not help a sort of inward smile it is the old way of the world i thought would the fates have made that young woman fall from her bicycle if there had been two men coming along on their wheels as i jumped from my machine and approached her she turned her head and looked at me she was a pale girl and her face was troubled when i asked her if she had hurt herself she spoke to me without the slightest embarrassment or hesitation i twisted my foot in some way she said and i do not know what i am going to do it hurts me to make a step and i am sure i cannot work my wheel have you far to go i asked i live about two miles from here

at the great man s side the result of his affability was a still livelier desire that he should not remain in ignorance of the peculiar justice i had done him it was not that he seemed to thirst for justice on the contrary i had not yet caught in his talk the faintest grunt of a grudge a note for which my young experience had already given me an ear of late he had had more recognition and it was pleasant as we used to say in the middle to see that it drew him out he wasn t of course popular but i judged one of the sources of his good humour to be precisely that his success was independent of that he had none the less become in a manner the fashion the critics at least had put on a spurt and caught up with him we had found out at last how clever he was and he had had to make the best of the loss of his mystery i was strongly tempted as i walked beside him to let him know how much of that unveiling was my act and there was a moment when i probably should have done so had not one of the ladies of our party snatching a place at his other elbow just then appealed to him in a spirit comparatively selfish it was very discouraging i almost felt the liberty had been taken with myself i had had on my tongue s end for my own part a phrase or two about the right word at the right time but later on i was glad not to have spoken for when on our return we clustered at tea i perceived lady jane who had not been out with us brandishing the middle with her longest arm she had taken it up at her leisure she was delighted with what she had found and i saw that as a mistake in a man may often be a felicity in a woman she would practically do for me what i hadn t been able to do for myself some sweet little truths that needed to be spoken i heard her declare thrusting the paper at rather a bewildered couple by the fireplace she grabbed it away from them again on the reappearance of hugh vereker who after our walk had been upstairs to change something i know you don t in general look at this kind of thing but it s an occasion really for doing so you haven t seen it then you must the man has actually got at you at what i always feel you know lady jane threw into her eyes a look evidently intended to give an idea of what she always felt but she added that she couldn t have expressed it the man in the paper expressed it in a striking manner just see there and there where i ve dashed it how he brings it out she had literally marked for him the brightest patches of my prose and if i was a little amused vereker himself may well have been he showed how much he was when before us all lady jane wanted to read something aloud i liked at any rate the way he defeated her purpose by jerking the paper affectionately out of her clutch he would take it upstairs with him would look at it on going to dress he did this half an hour later i saw it in his hand when he repaired to his room that was the moment at which thinking to give her pleasure i mentioned to lady jane that i was the author of the review i did give her pleasure i judged but perhaps not quite so much as i had expected if the author was only me the thing didn t seem quite so remarkable hadn t i had the effect rather of diminishing the lustre of the article than of adding to my own her ladyship was subject to the most extraordinary drops it didn t matter the only effect i cared about was the one it would have on vereker up there by his bedroom fire at dinner i watched for the signs of this impression tried to fancy there was some happier light in his eyes but to my disappointment lady jane gave me no chance to make sure i had hoped she would call triumphantly down the table publicly demand if she hadn t been right the party was large there were people from outside as well but i had never seen a table long enough to deprive lady jane of a triumph i was just reflecting in truth that this interminable board would deprive me of one when the guest next me dear woman she was miss poyle the vicar s sister a robust unmodulated person had the happy inspiration and the unusual courage to address herself across it to vereker who was opposite but not directly so that when he replied they were both leaning forward she inquired artless body what he thought of lady jane s panegyric which she had read not connecting it however with her right hand neighbour and while i strained my ear for his reply i heard him to my stupefaction call back gaily with his mouth full of bread oh it s all right it s the usual twaddle i had caught vereker s glance as he spoke but miss poyle s surprise was a fortunate cover for my own you mean he doesn t do you justice said the excellent woman vereker laughed out and i was happy to be able to do the same it s a charming article he tossed us miss poyle thrust her chin half across the cloth oh you re so deep she drove home as deep as the ocean all i pretend is the author doesn t see a dish was at this point passed over his shoulder and we had to wait while he helped himself doesn t see what my neighbour continued doesn t see anything dear me how very stupid not a bit vereker laughed again nobody does the lady on his further side appealed to him and miss poyle sank back to me nobody sees anything she cheerfully announced to which i replied that i had often thought so too but had somehow taken the thought for a proof on my own part of a tremendous eye i didn t tell her the article was mine and i observed that lady jane occupied at the end of the table had not caught vereker s words i rather avoided him after dinner for i confess he

in the same breath as being both of them above mere talent and we do not dissent when macaulay after reading burke s works over again exclaims how admirable the greatest man since milton the precise date of burke s birth cannot be stated with certainty all that we can say is that it took place either in or and it is possible that we may set it down in one or the other year as we choose to reckon by the old or the new style the best opinion is that he was born at dublin on the th of january n s his father was a solicitor in good practice and is believed to have been descended from some bourkes of county limerick who held a respectable local position in the time of the civil wars burke s mother belonged to the nagle family which had a strong connection in the county of cork they had been among the last adherents of james ii and they remained firm catholics mrs burke remained true to the church of her ancestors and her only daughter was brought up in the same faith edmund burke and his two brothers garret and richard were bred in the religion of their father but burke never in after times lost a large and generous way of thinking about the more ancient creed of his mother and his uncles in he was sent to school at ballitore a village some thirty miles away from dublin where abraham shackleton a quaker from yorkshire had established himself fifteen years before and had earned a wide reputation as a successful teacher and a good man according to burke he richly deserved this high character it was to abraham shackleton that he always professed to owe whatever gain had come to him from education if i am anything he said many years afterwards it is the education i had there that has made me so his master s skill as a teacher did not impress him more than the example which was every day set before him of uprightness and simplicity of heart thirty years later when burke had the news of shackleton s death i had a true honour and affection he wrote for that excellent man i feel something like a satisfaction in the midst of my concern that i was fortunate enough to have him once under my roof before his departure no man has ever had a deeper or more tender reverence than burke for homely goodness simple purity and all the pieties of life it may well be that this natural predisposition of all characters at once so genial and so serious as his was finally stamped in him by his first schoolmaster it is true that he was only two years at ballitore but two years at that plastic time often build up habits in the mind that all the rest of a life is unable to pull down in burke became a student of trinity college dublin and he remained there until when he took his bachelor s degree these five years do not appear to have been spent in strenuous industry in the beaten paths of academic routine like so many other men of great gifts burke in his youth was desultory and excursive he roamed at large over the varied heights that tempt our curiosity as the dawn of intelligence first lights them up one after another with bewitching visions and illusive magic all my studies burke wrote in when he was in the midst of them have rather proceeded from sallies of passion than from the preference of sound reason and like all other natural appetites have been very violent for a season and very soon cooled and quite absorbed in the succeeding i have often thought it a humorous consideration to observe and sum up all the madness of this kind i have fallen into this two years past first i was greatly taken with natural philosophy which while i should have given my mind to logic employed me incessantly this i call my furor mathematicus but this worked off as soon as i began to read it in the college as men by repletion cast off their stomachs all they have eaten then i turned back to logic and metaphysics here i remained a good while and with much pleasure and this was my furor logicus a disease very common in the days of ignorance and very uncommon in these enlightened times next succeeded the furor historicus which also had its day but is now no more being entirely absorbed in the furor poeticus this is from one of burke s letters to richard shackleton the son of his schoolmaster with whom he had formed one of those close friendships that fill the life of generous youth as ambition fills an energetic manhood many tears were shed when the two boys parted at ballitore and they kept up their intimacy by a steady correspondence they discuss the everlasting dispute as to the ultimate fate of those who never heard the saving name of christ they send one another copies of verses and burke prays for shackleton s judgment on an invocation of his new poem to beauteous nymphs who haunt the dusky wood which hangs recumbent o er the crystal flood burke is warned by shackleton to endeavour to live according to the rules of the gospel and he humbly accepts the good advice with the deprecatory plea that in a town it is difficult to sit down to think seriously it is easier he says to follow the rules of the gospel in the country than at trinity college dublin in the region of profaner things the two friends canvass the comparative worth of sallust and of tully s epistles burke holds for the historian who has he thinks a fine easy diversified narrative mixed with reflection moral and political neither very trite nor obvious nor out of the way and abstract and this is the true beauty of historical observation some pages of verse describe to shackleton how his friend passes the day but the reader will perhaps be content to learn in humbler prose that burke rose with the dawn and strode forth into the country through fragrant gardens and the pride of may until want of breakfast drove him back

told him to convey his compliments to the captain on his proper navigation of the channel the young man looked very closely at uncle and said sure i ll tell him right away but he said it kindly then he said to me when uncle couldn t hear your pa ain t quite right is he miss hohen i didn t know what he meant but of course i said that uncle william was only my uncle hohen is i should explain the name by which we are known now the young man said that he wasn t really a steward only just for the trip he said that because i had a strange feeling that i had met him before and asked him if i hadn t seen him at one of the courts but he said he had never been up before one in his life he said he lives in new york and drives an ice wagon and is an ice man he said he was glad to have the pleasure of our acquaintance he is i think the first ice man i have ever met he reminds me very much of the romanoffs the grand dukes of the younger branch i mean but he says he is not connected with them so far as he knows he said his name is peters we have no almanach de gotha here on board the steamer so i cannot look up his name s s america thursday we had a dreadful experience last night in the middle of the night uncle henry came and called me and said that uncle william was ill so i put on an old shawl and went with him the ship was pitching and heaving with a dreadful straining and creaking noise a dim light burned in the cabin and outside there was a great roaring of the wind and the wild sound of the sea surging against the ship uncle william was half sitting up in his rough bunk with the tattered gray blankets over him one hand was clutched on the side of the bed and there was a great horror in his eyes the sea the sea he kept saying don t let me hear it it s their voices listen they re beating at the sides of the ship keep them from me keep them out he was quiet for a minute until there came another great rush of the sea against the sides of the ship and a roar of water against the port then he broke out almost screaming henry brother henry keep them back don t let them drag me down i never willed it i never wanted it their death is not at my door it was necessity henry brother henry tell them not to drag me below the sea like that he raved for perhaps an hour and we tried to quiet him cousin willie had slipped away i don t know where cousin ferdinand was in his bunk with his back turned do i slip to night at all he kept growling or do i not say mister do i get any slip at all but no one minded him then daylight came and uncle fell asleep his face looked drawn and gray and the cords stood out on his withered hand which was clutched against his shirt so he slept it seemed so strange there was no court physician no bulletins to reassure the world that he was sleeping quietly later in the morning i saw the ship s doctor and the captain all in uniform with gold braid walking on their inspection round you had some trouble here last night i heard the captain say no nothing the doctor answered only one of the steerage passengers delirious in the night later in the morning the storm had gone down and the sea was calm as glass and uncle henry and i got uncle william up on deck mr peters the steward that i think i spoke about before got us a steamer chair from the first class that had been thrown away quite good except for one leg and uncle william sat in it with his face away from the sea he seemed much shaken and looked gray and tired but he talked quite quietly and rationally about our going to america and how we must all work because work is man s lot he himself he says will take up the presidency of harvard university in new york and uncle henry who of course was our own grand admiral and is a sailor will enter as admiral of the navy of one of the states probably uncle says the navy of missouri or else that of colorado it was pleasant to hear uncle wil

ignorance he said neither and responded with the american boy s modest conventionality president it was safe required no embarrassing description and had been approved by benevolent old gentlemen with their hands on his head i m goin to be a parson s wife said susy and keep hens and have things giv to me baby clothes and apples and apple sass and melasses and more baby clothes and pork when you kill she had thrown herself at the bottom of the wagon with her back towards him and her doll in her lap he could see the curve of her curly head and beyond her bare dimpled knees which were raised and over which she was trying to fold the hem of her brief skirt i wouldn t be a president s wife she said presently you couldn t could if i wanted to couldn t could now couldn t why finding it difficult to explain his convictions of her ineligibility clarence thought it equally crushing not to give any there was a long silence it was very hot and dusty the wagon scarcely seemed to move clarence gazed at the vignette of the track behind them formed by the hood of the rear presently he rose and walked past her to the tail board goin to get down he said putting his legs over maw says no said susy clarence did not reply but dropped to the ground beside the slowly turning wheels without quickening his pace he could easily keep his hand on the tail board kla uns he looked up take me she had already clapped on her sun bonnet and was standing at the edge of the tail board her little arms extended in such perfect confidence of being caught that the boy could not resist he caught her

hundred yards and then with a sudden half real half assumed but altogether delightful trepidation ran forward and caught up with it again this they repeated two or three times until both themselves and the excitement were exhausted and they again plodded on hand in hand presently clarence uttered a cry my susy look there the rear wagon had once more slipped away from them a considerable distance between it and them crossing its track a most extraordinary creature had halted at first glance it seemed a dog a discomfited shameless ownerless outcast of streets and byways rather than an honest stray of some drover s train it was so gaunt so dusty so greasy so slouching and so lazy but as they looked at it more intently they saw that the grayish hair of its back had a bristly ridge and there were great poisonous looking dark blotches on its flanks and that the slouch of its haunches was a peculiarity of its figure and not the cowering of fear as it lifted its suspicious head towards them they could see that its thin lips too short to cover its white teeth were curled in a perpetual sneer here doggie said clarence excitedly good dog come susy burst into a triumphant laugh et tain t no

without apparently the least effort took two or three limping bounds to one side and remained at the same distance as before they repeated this onset three or four times with more or less excitement and hilarity the animal evading them to one side but never actually retreating before them finally it occurred to them both that although they were not catching him they were not driving him away the consequences of that thought were put into shape by susy with round eyed significance kla uns he bites clarence picked up a hard sun baked clod and running forward threw it at the coyote it was a clever shot and struck him on his slouching haunches he snapped and gave a short snarling yelp and vanished clarence returned with a victorious air to his companion but she was gazing intently in the opposite direction and for the first time he discovered that the coyote had been leading them half round a circle kla uns said susy with a hysterical little laugh well the wagon s gone clarence started it was true not only their wagon but the whole train of oxen and teamsters had utterly disappeared vanishing as completely as if they had been caught up in a whirlwind or engulfed in the earth

eastern coast of england in this the month of february of the year hard and bitter frost held suffolk in its grip the muddy stream of blyth it is true was frozen only in places since the tide flowing up from the southwold harbour where it runs into the sea between that ancient town and the hamlet of walberswick had broken up the ice but all else was set hard and fast and now toward sunset the cold was bitter stark and naked stood the tall dry reeds the blackbirds and starlings perched upon the willows seemed swollen into feathery balls the fur started on the backs of hares and a four horse wain could travel in safety over swamps where at any other time a schoolboy dared not set his foot on such an eve with snow threatening the great marsh was utterly desolate and this was why these two had chosen it for their meeting place to look on they were a goodly pair the girl who was clothed in the red she always wore tall dark well shaped with large black eyes and a determined face one who would make a very stately woman the man broad shouldered with grey eyes that were quick and almost fierce long limbed hard agile and healthy one who had never known sickness who looked as though the world were his own to master he was young but three and twenty that day and his simple dress a tunic of thick wool fastened round him with a leathern belt to which hung a short sword showed that his degree was modest the girl although she seemed his elder in fact was only in her twentieth year yet from her who had been reared in the hard school of that cruel age childhood had long departed leaving her a ripened woman before her time this pair stood looking at each other well cousin eve clavering said the man in his clear voice why did your message bid me meet you in this cold place because i had a word to say to you cousin hugh de cressi she answered boldly and the marsh being so cold and so lonesome i thought it suited to my purpose does grey dick watch yonder ay behind those willows arrow on

manors and land counting our acres by the thousand but yet poor lacking your gold though yonder manor and she pointed to some towers which rose far away above the trees upon the high land has many mouths to feed also the sea has robbed us at dunwich where i was born taking our great house and sundry streets that paid us rent and your market of southwold has starved out ours at blythburgh well

and legs to the waist brightly lighted but his face disintegrated in shadow like the face of a dark ghost are you ill man still no answer save a shake of that head and the passing up of a hand out of the light to the ghostly forehead under the dishevelled hair the scent of whisky was stronger now and keith thought he really is drunk nice thing for the new butler to see if he can t behave the figure against the wall heaved a sigh so truly from an overburdened heart that keith was conscious with a certain dismay of not having yet fathomed the cause of this uncanny silence he got up and back to the fire said with a brutality born of nerves rather than design what is it man have you committed a murder that you stand there dumb as a fish for a second no answer at all not even of breathing then just the whisper yes the sense of unreality which so helps one at moments of disaster enabled keith to say vigorously by jove you have been drinking but it passed at once into deadly apprehension what do you mean come here where i can see you what s the matter with you larry with a sudden lurch and dive his brother left the shelter of the shadow and sank into a chair in the circle of light and another long broken sigh escaped him there s nothing the matter with me keith it s true keith stepped quickly forward and stared down into his brother s face and instantly he saw that it was true no one could have simulated the look in those eyes of horrified wonder as if they would never again get on terms with the face to which they belonged to see them squeezed the heart only real misery could look like that then that sudden pity became angry bewilderment what in god s name is this nonsense but it was significant that he lowered his voice went over to the door too to see if it were shut laurence had drawn his chair forward huddling over the fire a thin figure a worn high cheekboned face with deep sunk blue eyes and wavy hair all ruffled a face that still had a certain beauty putting a hand on that lean shoulder keith said come larry pull yourself together and drop exaggeration it s true i tell you i ve killed a man the noisy violence of that outburst acted like a douche what was the fellow about shouting out such words but suddenly laurence lifted his hands and wrung them the gesture was so utterly painful that it drew a quiver from keith s face why did you come here he said and tell me this larry s face was really unearthly sometimes such strange gleams passed up on to it whom else should i tell i came to know what i m to do keith give myself up or what at that sudden introduction of the practical keith felt his heart twitch was it then as real as all that but he said very quietly just tell me how did it come about this affair that question linked the dark gruesome fantastic nightmare on to actuality when did it happen last night in larry s face there was there had always been something childishly truthful he would never stand a chance in court and keith said how where you d better tell me quietly from the beginning drink this coffee it ll clear your head laurence took the little blue cup and drained it yes he said it s like this keith there s a girl i ve known for some months now women and keith said between his teeth well her father was a pole who died over here when she was sixteen and left her all alone a man called walenn a mongrel american living in the same house married her or pretended to she s very pretty keith he left her with a baby six months old and another coming that one died and she did nearly then she starved till another fellow took her on she lived with him two years then walenn turned up again and made her go back to him the brute used to beat her black and blue all for nothing then he left her again when i met her she d lost her elder child too and was taking anybody who came along he suddenly looked up into keith s face but i ve never met a sweeter woman nor a truer that i swear woman she s only twenty now when i went to her last night that brute that walenn had found her out again and when he came for me swaggering and bullying look he touched a dark mark on his forehead i took his throat in my hands and when i let go yes dead i never knew till afterwards that she was hanging on to him behind again he made that gesture wringing his hands in a hard voice keith said what did you do then we sat by it a long time then i carried it on my back down the street round a corner to an archway how far about fifty yards was anyone did anyone see no what time three and then went back to her why in heaven s name she was lonely and afraid so was i keith where is this place forty two borrow street soho and the archway corner of glove lane good god why i saw it in the paper and seizing the journal that lay on his

had apparently been robbed and nothing was discovered leading to identification it was real earnest then murder his own brother he faced round and said you saw this in the paper and dreamed it

not present a finished portrait to the reader it provides him with the materials from which he can form a portrait for himself the external events are placed upon record either in the letters or in the connecting links of narrative the character and opinions of mrs browning reveal themselves in her correspondence and her genius is enshrined in her poetry and these three elements make up all that may be known of her personality all with which a biographer has to deal it is essentially her character not her genius that is presented to the reader of these letters there are some letter writers whose genius is so closely allied with their daily life that it shines through into their familiar correspondence with their friends and their letters become literature such in their very different ways with very different types of genius and very different habits of daily life are gray cowper lamb perhaps fitzgerald but letter writers such as these are few more often the correspondence of men and women of letters is valuable for the light it throws upon the character and opinions of those whose character and opinions we are led to regard with admiration or respect or at least interest on account of their other writings in these cases it may be held that the publication is justifiable or not according as the character which it reveals is affected favourably or the reverse not all truth even about famous men is useful for publication but only such as enables us to appreciate better the works which have made them famous their highest selves are expressed in their literary work and it is a poor service to truth to insist on bringing to light the fact that they also had lower selves common dull it may be vicious what illustrates their genius and enhances our respect for their character may rightly be made known but what shakes our belief and mars our enjoyment in them is simply better left in obscurity with regard to mrs browning however there is no room for doubt upon these points these letters familiarly written to her private friends without the smallest idea of publication treating of the thoughts that came uppermost in the ordinary language of conversation can lay no claim to make a new revelation of her genius on the other hand perhaps because the circumstances of mrs browning s life cut her off to an unusual extent from personal intercourse with her friends and threw her back upon letter writing as her principal means of communication with them they contain an unusually full revelation of her character and this is not wholly unconnected with her literary genius since her personal convictions her moral character entered more fully than is often the case into the composition of her poetry her best poetry is that which is most full of her personal emotions the sonnets from the portuguese the cry of the children cowper s grave the dead pan aurora leigh and all the italian poems owe their value to the pure and earnest character the strong love of truth and right the enthusiasm on behalf of what is oppressed and the indignation against all kinds of oppression and wrong which were prominent elements in a personality of exceptional worth and beauty an editor can generally serve his readers best by remaining in the background but he is allowed one moment for the expression of his personal feelings when he thanks those who have assisted him in his work in the present case there are many to whom it is a pleasure to offer such thanks in the first place i have to thank mr r barrett browning and miss browning most cordially for having accepted the proposal of the publishers messrs smith elder co to whom likewise my gratitude is due to put so pleasant and congenial a task into my hands mr browning has also contributed a number of suggestions and corrections while the sheets have been passing through the press i have also to thank those who have been kind enough to offer letters in their possession for inclusion in

sincere thanks to lady edmond fitzmaurice for much assistance and advice in the selection and revision of the letters a labour which her friendship with mr browning towards the close of his life has

for more than a year and in this time had learned to admire not only her beauty of person but her gameness and wholesome mentality he knew something of her past life and history too as well from her own lips as from common gossip for this was no ordinary woman and her achievements were familiar to many she was the daughter of captain bob seaver whose remarkable career was known to every man in the west captain bob was one forty niners and had made fortunes and lost them with marvelous regularity he had a faculty for finding gold but his speculations were invariably unwise so his constant transitions from affluence to poverty and vice versa were the subject of many amusing tales many no doubt grossly exaggerated and the last venture of captain bob seaver before he died was to buy the discredited ten spot mine and start to develop it at that time he was a widower with one motherless child antoinette a girl of eighteen who had been reared partly in mining camps and partly at exclusive girls schools in the east according to her father s varying fortunes tony seaver as she was generally called in those days combined culture and refinement with a thorough knowledge of mining and when her father passed away and left her absolute mistress of the tantalizing ten spot she set to work to make the mine a success directing her men in person and displaying such shrewd judgment and intelligence coupled with kindly consideration for her assistants that she became the idol of the miners all of whom were proud to be known as employees of tony seaver s ten spot would have died for their beautiful employer if need be and the ten spot made good in five years tony had garnered a million or two of well earned dollars and then she sold out and retired from business also to the chagrin of an army of suitors she married an artist named jason jones whose talent it was said was not so great as his luck so far his fame rested on his being tony seaver s husband but tony s hobby was art and she had recognized real worth she claimed in jason jones creations on her honeymoon she carried her artist husband to europe and with him studied the works of the masters in all the art centers of the continent then enthusiastic and eager for jason s advancement she returned with him to new york and set him up in a splendid studio where he had every convenience and incentive to work so much the world at large knew it also knew that within three years mrs antoinette seaver jones separated from her husband and with her baby girl returned west to live the elaborate jones studio was abandoned and broken up and the promising young artist disappeared from the public eye mrs jones a thorough business woman had retained her fortune in her own control and personally attended to her investments she became noted as a liberal patron of the arts and a generous donor to worthy charities in spite of her youth wealth and beauty she had no desire to shine in society and lived a somewhat secluded life in luxurious family hotels attending with much solicitude to the training and education of her daughter alora at first she had made denver her home but afterward migrated from one middle west city to another until she came to chicago where she had now lived for nearly three years occupying the most expensive suite of rooms at the very exclusive hotel voltaire alora fairly worshipped her beautiful mother and although mrs antoinette seaver jones was considered essentially cold and unemotional by those who knew her casually there was no doubt she prized her child as her dearest possession and lavished all the tenderness and love of which she was capable upon her retrospectively doctor anstruther considered this historical revue of his fair patient as he sat facing her it seemed a most unhappy fate that she should be cut off in the flower of her womanhood but her case was positively hopeless and she knew it and had accepted the harsh verdict without a murmur bravery had always been tony seaver s prime characteristic to doctor anstruther it seemed that she might as well know the truth which she had demanded from his lips this disease is one that accelerates toward the end he said within the past few days we have noted its more virulent tendency all we can do now is to keep you from suffering until the end and that will be when she demanded i think i can safely give you a week but then i must act at once she said as he hesitated i must first of all make provision for alora s future and in this i require your help you know you may depend upon me he said simply please telegraph at once to my husband jason jones in new york the request startled him for never before had she mentioned her husband s name in his presence but he asked calmly enough what is

anywhere in our east or west i who was then vainly trying to be english escaped to the congenial top of the farthest bound tram and flew at the rate of four miles an hour to the uttermost suburbs of liverpool whither no rumor of my native speech could penetrate it was some balm to my wounded pride of country to note how pale and small the average type of the local people was the poorer classes swarmed along a great part of the tram line in side streets of a hard stony look and what characterized itself to me as a sort of iron squalor seemed to prevail you cannot anywhere have great prosperity without great adversity just as you cannot have day without night and the more liverpool evidently flourished the more it plainly languished i found no pleasure in the paradox and i was not overjoyed by the inevitable ugliness of the brick villas of the suburbs into which these obdurate streets decayed but then after divers tram changes came the consolation of beautiful riverside beaches thronged with people who looked gay at that distance and beyond the mersey rose the welsh hills blue blue iii at the end of the tram line where we necessarily dismounted we rejected a thatched cottage offering us tea because we thought it too thatched and too cottage to be quite true though i do not now say that there were vermin in the straw roof and accepted the hospitality of a pastry cook s shop we felt the more at home with the kind woman who kept it because she had a brother at chicago in the employ of the pinkerton detective agency and had once been in stratford on avon this doubly satisfied us as cultivated americans she had a welsh name and she testified to a great prevalence of welsh and irish in the population of liverpool besides she sent us to a church of the crusaders at little crosby and it was no fault of hers that we did not find it we found one of the many old crosses for which little crosby is named and this was quite as much as we merited it stood at the intersection of the streets in what seemed the fragment of a village not yet lost in the vast maw of the city and it calmed all the simple neighborhood so that we sat down at its foot and rested a long long minute till the tram came by and took us back into the loud hard heart of liverpool i do not mean to blame it for it was no louder or harder than the hearts of other big towns and it had some alleviation from the many young couples who were out together half holidaying in the unusually pleasant saturday weather i wish their complexions had been better but you cannot have south of england color if you live as far north as liverpool and all the world knows what the american color is the young couples abounded in the gallery of fine arts where they frankly looked at one another

any case those couples could come and see them when they were old men and women but now they had one another in a moment of half holiday which could not last forever in the evening there were not so many lovers at the religious meetings before the classic edifice opposite the hotel where the devotions were transacted with the help of a brass band but there were many youths smoking short pipes and flitting from one preacher to another in the half dozen groups some preachers were nonconformist but there was one perspiring anglican priest who labored earnestly with his hearers and who had more of his aspirates in the right place many of his hearers were in the rags which seem a favorite wear in liverpool and i hope his words did their poor hearts good slightly apart from the several congregations i found myself with a fellow foreigner of seafaring complexion who addressed me in an accent so unlike my own american that i ventured to answer him in italian he was indeed a genoese who had spent much time in buenos ayres and was presently thinking of new york and we had some friendly discourse together concerning the english his ideas of them were often so parallel with my own that i hardly know how to say he thought them an improvident people i owned that they spent much more on state or station than the americans but we neither had any censure for them otherwise he was of that philosophic mind which one is rather apt to encounter in the latin races and i could well wish for his further acquaintance his talk rapt me to far other and earlier scenes and i seemed to be conversing with him under a venetian heaven among objects of art more convincing than the equestrian statue of the late queen who had no special motive i could think of for being shown to her rightly loving subjects on horseback we parted with the expressed hope of seeing each other again and if this should meet his eye and he can recall the pale young man with the dark full beard who chatted with him between the pillars of the piazzetta forty years before our actual encounter i would be glad of his address iv how strange are the uses of travel there was a time when the mention of liverpool would have conjured up for me nothing but the thought of hawthorne who spent divers dull consular years there and has left a record of them which i had read with the wish that it were cheerfuler yet now here on the ground his feet might have trod and in the very smoke he breathed i did not once think of him i thought as little of that poor felicia hemans whose poetry filled my school reading years with the roar of the wintry sea breaking from the waveless plymouth bay on the stern and rock bound coast where the pilgrim fathers landed on a bowlder measuring eight by ten feet now fenced in

on any account macrae would be a very costly article and moreover i want him to act major domo here unless you would and that i don t dare to hope for no you must not lily ada never feels well here nor always at brighton and emily would be too nervous to have her without me but we will take as many children as you please or we have room for that is like you jenny i know william will offer to take them in at home but i cannot send them without miss vincent and she cannot leave her mother who has had a sort of stroke otherwise i should try leaving them here while i am away but the poor old lady is in no state for it in fact i doubt her living long i know you have been governess by yourself these last weeks it will be well to relieve her the best way will be for us to take mysie and valetta and let them go to the high school and there is a capital day school for little boys close to st andrew s for fergus and gillian can go there too or join classes in whatever she pleases my brownie have you really room for all those oh yes the three girls in the spare room and dressing room and fergus in the little room over the porch i will write to fanny i gave her a hint and i have no doubt that primrose will be a delight to her aunt alethea poor little dear yes that makes it all easy for in the holidays i know the boys are sure of a welcome at the dear old home or hal might have one or two of them at his curacy the gong sounded for the melancholy dinner that had to go on all the same and in the midst all were startled by the arrival of a telegram which macrae looking awestruck actually delivered to harry instead of to his mistress but it was not from ceylon it was from colonel mohun from beechcroft coming going with you send children here never were twenty words including addresses more satisfactory the tears came for the first time to lady merrifield s eyes at the kindness of her brothers and harry was quite satisfied that his uncle would be a far better escort than himself or macrae aunt jane went off to send her telegram home and write some needful letters and lady merrifield announced her arrangements to those whom they concerned oh mamma don t exclaimed valetta all the guinea pigs will die i thought said gillian that we might stay here with miss vincent to look after us that will not do in her mother s state mrs vincent cannot be moved up here and i could not lay such a burthen on them we would be very good said val that i hope you will be any way but i think it will be easier at rockstone and i am quite sure that papa and i shall be

animals than your four selves you must ask her only do not be surprised or put out if she refuses for i don t believe you can keep anything there off the three younger ones went gillian observing i don t see how they can unless it was quiz but mamma don t you think i might go to beechcroft with primrose i should be so much quieter working for the examination there and i could send my exercises to miss vincent and then i should keep up prim s lessons your aunt alethea will i know like doing that my dear and i am afraid to turn those creatures loose on the aunts without some one to look after them and their clothes fanny will be very helpful but it will not do to throw too much on her oh i thought they would have lois there would not be room for her besides that i don t think it would suit your aunts you and mysie ought to do all the mending for yourselves and fergus and what valetta cannot manage i know you would rather be at beechcroft my dear but in this distress and difficulty some individual likings must be given up yes mamma lady merrifield looked rather dubiously at her daughter she had very little time and did not want to have an argument nor to elicit murmurs yet it might be better to see what was in gillian s mind before it was too late mothers very fond of their own sisters cannot always understand why it is not the same with their daughters who inherit another element of inherited character and of another generation and who have not been welded together with the aunts in childhood my dear she said you know i am quite ready to hear if you have any real reasonable objection to this arrangement no mamma i don t think i have said gillian thoughtfully the not liking always meeting a lot of strangers nor the general bustle is all nonsense i know quite well i see it is best for the children but i should like to know exactly who is to be in authority over them certainly aunt jane replied lady merrifield she must be the ultimate authority of course you will check the younger ones in anything going wrong as you would here and very likely there will be more restrictions aunt ada has to be considered and it will be a town life but remember that your aunt is mistress of the house and that even if you do think her arrangements uncalled for it is your duty to help the others to submit cheerfully say anything you please fully and freely in your

edification as for ours but i was interested for i greatly desired to recover the blood mare stolen from me i was then five and twenty fairly stalwart and tall of stature and seldom regretted that after a good education in england i had gone out to western canada to assist a relative in raising cattle the old man was slow and cautious but he taught me my business well before he died suddenly and left me his possessions adding my small patrimony i made larger profits by taking heavier risks and for fortune had favored me and youth is no handicap in the colonies my homestead was one of the finest in that section of the country save for occasional risks of frost bite and wild rides through blinding snow the life had been toilsome rather than eventful but the day which while we talked in the outpost was speeding westward across the pines of quebec and the lakes of ontario to gild the rockies peaks was to mark a turning point in my history suddenly a beat of hoofs rose out of the night there was a jingle outside and the cold set me shivering when a man who held a smoking horse s bridle stood by the open door your man tried to buy a horse from the reservation crees and when they wouldn t trade doubled on his tracks heading west for the bitter lakes i ve nearly killed my beast to bring you word he said horses stood ready in the sod stable behind the dwelling and in less than three minutes we were in the saddle and flitting in single file across the prairie it was about five o clock in the morning and though winter should have been over it was very bitter the steam from the horses hung about us our breath froze on our furs but a chinook wind had swept the prairie clear of snow and though in the barer places the ground rang like iron beneath us the carpet of matted grasses made moderately fast traveling possible no word was spoken and when the silent figures about me faded as they spread out to left and right and only a faint jingle of steel or dull thud of hoofs betokened their presence i seemed to have ridden out of all touch with warmth and life the frost bit keen the heavens were black with the presage of coming storm and the utter silence seemed the hush of death beast and bird had long fled south and i started when once the ghostly howl of a coyote rose eerily and faintly from the rim of the prairie by daylight we had left long leagues behind us and i was the better pleased that the fugitive s trail of which we found signs led back towards my own homestead for a brief five minutes the rockies seen very far off across the levels flushed crimson against the sky then the line of spectral peaks faded suddenly and we were left four tiny crawling specks in the center of a limitless gray circle whose circumference receded steadily as the hours went by but the trail grew plainer to the sergeant s practiced eyes and when we had crossed the bitter lakes on rotten and but partially refrozen ice he predicted that we should come up with the fugitive by nightfall if our horses held out mine was the best in the party and though not equal to the stolen mare the latter had already traveled fast and far it was a depressing journey no ray of sunlight touched the widespread levels and there was neither smoke trail nor sign of human life in all that great desolation hands and feet lost sense of feeling the cold numbed one s very brain but the wardens of the prairie used alike to sleep in a snow trench or swim an icy ford care little for adverse weather and mackay held on with a slow tenacity that boded ill for the man he was pursuing the light showed signs of failing when trooper cotton shouted and we caught sight of our quarry a shadowy blur on the crest of a low rise that seamed the prairie ye may save your breath for ye ll need it said mackay it s a league from yon rise to the sweetwater an there s neither ice bridge nor safe ford now if he s across before we are we ll no grip him the night i m thinking and there s ill weather brewing whip and heel were plied and the worn out beasts responded as best they might the man who had taught me stock and horse breeding knew his business and when my beast raced across the edge of the rise the troopers were at least two hundred yards behind then the exultation of the chase took hold of me and my frozen blood commenced to stir as the staunch beast beneath me swept faster and faster down the long gray incline at every stride i was coming up with the horse thief a dusky ridge of birches loomed ahead shutting off the steep dip to the river beyond this there were thicker trees and the light was failing but while all this promised safety for the pursued i was gaining fast and the troopers were dropping further behind the fugitive had just reached the timber when a light wagon lurched out from it and i yelled to the man who drove it to hold clear of my path there was a hoarse shout away to the left and when no answer came back the crack of a carbine a repeating rifle banged against my back and feeling that its sling lay within easy reach i drove my heels home as i raced past the wagon there was scarcely time for a side glance but the one i risked set my heart beating two feminine figures wrapped in furs sat within it and one smiled at me as i passed the face that looked out from beneath the fur cap was worth remembering though it was several years

whirlepoole of decay its sea monsters and lastly its bower of bliss and the doom which overtakes it together with the deliverance of acrasia s victims transformed by that witch s spells into beasts still more powerful is the allegory of worldly ambition illustrated under the name of the cave of mammon the legend of holiness delineates with not less insight those enemies which wage war upon the spiritual life all this milton had studied in the faerie queene and had understood it and like sir guyon he felt himself to be a knight enrolled under the banner of parity and self control so that in comus we find the sovereign value of temperance or self regulation what the greeks called x x x x x set forth no less clearly than in spenser s poem in milton s mask it becomes almost identical with virtue itself the enchantments of acrasia in her bower of bliss become the spells of comus the armour of belphoebe becomes the complete steel of chastity while the supremacy of conscience the bounty of nature and man s ingratitude the unloveliness of mammon and of excess the blossom of courtesy oft found on lowly stalk and the final triumph of virtue through striving and temptation all are dwelt upon it is the mind that maketh good or ill that maketh wretch or happie rich or poore so speaks spenser and milton similarly he that has light within his own clear breast may sit i the centre and enjoy bright day but he that hides a dark soul and foul thoughts benighted walks under the mid day sun himself is his own dungeon in endeavouring still further to trace by means of verbal or structural resemblances the sources from which milton drew his materials for comus critics have referred to peele s old wives tale to fletcher s pastoral the faithful shepherdess of which charles lamb has said that if all its parts had been in unison with its many innocent scenes and sweet lyric intermixtures it had been a poem fit to vie with comus or the arcadia to have been put into the hands of boys and virgins to have made matter for young dreams like the loves of hermia and lysander to ben jonson s mask of pleasure reconciled to virtue in which comus is the god of cheer or the belly and to the comus of erycius puteanus henri du puy professor of eloquence at louvain it is true that fletcher s pastoral was being acted in london about the time milton was writing his comus that the poem by the dutch professor was republished at oxford in and that resemblances are evident between milton s poem and those named but professor masson does well in warning us that infinitely too much has been made of such coincidences after all of them even the most ideal and poetical the feeling in reading comus is that all here is different all peculiar whatever milton borrowed he borrowed as he says himself in order to better it it is interesting to consider the mutual relations of the poems written by milton at horton everything that milton wrote is miltonic he had what has been called the power of transforming everything into himself and these poems are accordingly evidences of the development of milton s opinions and of his secret purpose it has been said that l allegro and il penseroso are to be regarded as the pleadings the decision on which is in comus l allegro representing the cavalier and il penseroso the puritan element this is true only in a limited sense it is true that the puritan element in the horton series of poems becomes more patent as we pass from the two lyrics to the mask of comus and from comus to the elegy of lycidas just as in the corresponding periods of time the evils connected with the reign of charles i and with laud s crusade against puritanism were becoming more pronounced but we can hardly regard milton as having expressed any new decision in comus the decision is already made when vain deluding joys are banished in il penseroso and loathed melancholy in l allegro the mask is an expansion and exaltation of the delights of the contemplative man but there is still a place for the unreproved pleasures of the cheerful man unless it were so comus could not have been written there would have been no sunshine holiday for the rustics and no victorious dance for the gentle lady and her brothers but in comus we realise the mutual relation of l allegro and il penseroso we see their application to the joys and sorrows of the actual life of individuals we observe human nature in contact with the hard assays of life and subsequently in lycidas we are made to realise that this human nature is milton s own and to understand how it was that his puritanism which three years before had permitted him to write a cavalier mask should three years after lead him from the fresh fields of poetry into the barren plains of controversial prose the mask was a favourite form of entertainment in england in milton s youth and had been so from the time of henry viii in whose reign elaborate masked shows introduced from italy first became popular but they seem to have found their way into england in a crude form even earlier and we read of court disguisings in the reign of edward iii it is usually said that the mask derives its name from the fact that the actors wore masks and in hall s chronicle we read that in on the day of epiphany at night the king with eleven others was disguised after the manner of italy called a mask a thing not seen before in england they were appareled in garments long and broad wrought all with gold with visors and caps of gold the truth however seems to be that the use of a visor was not essential in such entertainments whi

roman catholic then the question a question begging question was put quite suddenly without preparation or prelude by surprise why bishop was the spermaticos logos identified with the second and not the third person of the trinity it was indiscreet it was silly to turn upon the speaker and affect an air of disengagement and modernity and to say ah that indeed is the unfortunate aspect of the

all he suggested a reaction from a too manichaean dualism at some date after the time of st john s gospel he maintained obstinately that that gospel was dualistic the unpleasant quality of the talk was far more manifest in the retrospect than it had been at the time it had seemed then bold and strange but not impossible now in the cold darkness it seemed sacrilegious and the bishop s share which was indeed only the weak yielding of a tired man to an atmosphere he had misjudged became a disgraceful display of levity and bad faith they had baited him some one had said that nowadays every one was an arian knowingly or unknowingly they had not concealed their conviction that the bishop did not really believe in the creeds he uttered and that unfortunate first admission stuck terribly in his

above or below there must be a switch the switch was found grasped and turned the darkness fled in a mirror the sleeper saw the reflection of his face and a corner of the bed in which he lay the lamp had a tilted shade that threw a slanting bar of shadow across the field of reflection lighting a right angled triangle very brightly and leaving the rest obscure the bed was a very great one a bed for the anakim it had a canopy with yellow silk curtains surmounted by a gilded crown of carved wood between the curtains was a man s face clean shaven pale with disordered brown hair and weary pale blue eyes he was clad in purple pyjamas and the hand that now ran its fingers through the brown hair was long and lean and shapely beside the bed was a convenient little table bearing the light a water bottle and glass a bunch of keys a congested pocket book a gold banded fountain pen and a gold watch that indicated a quarter past three on the lower edge of the picture in the mirror appeared the back of a gilt chair over which a garment of peculiar construction had been carelessly thrown it was in the form of that sleeveless cassock of purple opening at the side whose lower flap is called a bishop s apron the corner of the frogged coat showed behind the chair back and the sash lay crumpled on the floor black doeskin breeches still warmly lined with their pants lay where they had been thrust off at the corner of the bed partly covering black hose and silver buckled shoes for a moment the tired gaze of the man in the bed rested upon these evidences of his episcopal dignity then he

he answers whose fault god made us and thinking of her and of the love i bore her which was as the love of a young pilgrim to a saint it comes into my blood to hate him but when i look into his eyes and see the pain that lives there my pity grows stronger than my misery and i can only echo his words god made us merry faces and sad fair faces and foul they ride upon the wind but the centre round

the revolution another letter introduces us to two of these gentlemen messrs acquilla hall and josias carvill volunteers who are recommended as of the first families in maryland and possessing independent fortunes after the british had been driven out of boston adams cries out fortify fortify and never let them get in again it is agreeable enough to perceive the filial affection with which john adams and the other delegates from the north regard new england and especially the good old capital of the puritans their love of country was hardly yet so diluted as to extend over the whole thirteen colonies which were rather looked upon as allies than as composing one nation in truth the patriotism of a citizen of the united states is a sentiment by itself of a peculiar nature and requiring a lifetime or at least the custom of many years to naturalize it among the other possessions of the heart the collection is enriched by a letter dated cambridge august from washington himself he wrote it in that house now so venerable with his memory in that very room where his bust now stands upon a poet s table from this sheet of paper passed the hand that held the leading staff nothing can be more perfectly in keeping with all other manifestations of washington than the whole visible aspect and embodiment of this letter the manuscript is as clear as daylight the punctuation exact to a comma there is a calm accuracy throughout which seems the production of a species of intelligence that cannot err and which if we may so speak would affect us with a more human warmth if we could conceive it capable of some slight human error the chirography is characterized by a plain and easy grace which in the signature is somewhat elaborated and becomes a type of the personal manner of a gentleman of the old school but without detriment to the truth and clearness that distinguish the rest of the manuscript the lines are as straight and equidistant as if ruled and from beginning to end there is no physical symptom as how should there be of a varying mood of jets of emotion or any of those fluctuating feelings that pass from the hearts into the fingers of common men the paper itself like most of those revolutionary letters which are written on fabrics fit to endure the burden of ponderous and earnest thought is stout and of excellent quality and bears the water mark of britannia surmounted by the crown the subject of the letter is a statement of reasons for not taking possession of point alderton a position commanding the entrance of boston harbor after explaining the difficulties of the case arising from his want of men and munitions for the adequate defence of the lines which he already occupies washington proceeds to you sir who are a well wisher to the cause and can reason upon the effects of such conduct i may open myself with freedom because no improper disclosures will be made of our situation but i cannot expose my weakness to the enemy though i believe they are pretty well informed of everything that passes by telling this and that man who are daily pointing out this and that and t other place of all the motives that govern my actions notwithstanding i know what will be the consequence of not doing it namely that i shall be accused of inattention to the public service and perhaps of want of spirit to prosecute it but this shall have no effect upon my conduct i will steadily as far as my judgment will assist me pursue such measures as i think conducive to the interest of the cause and rest satisfied under any obloquy that shall be thrown conscious of having discharged my duty to the best of my abilities the above passage like every other passage that could be quoted from his pen is characteristic of washington and entirely in keeping with the calm elevation of his soul yet how imperfect a glimpse do we obtain of him through the medium of this or any of his letters we imagine him writing calmly with a hand that never falters his majestic face neither darkens nor gleams with any momentary ebullition of feeling or irregularity of thought and thus flows forth an expression precisely to the extent of his purpose no more no less thus much we may conceive but still we have not grasped the man we have caught no glimpse of his interior we have not detected his personality it is the same with all the recorded traits of his daily life the collection of them by different observers seems sufficiently abundant and strictly harmonizes with itself yet never brings us into intimate relationship with the hero nor makes us feel the warmth and the human throb of his heart what can be the reason is it that his great nature was adapted to stand in relation to his country as man stands towards man but could not individualize itself in brotherhood to an individual there are two from franklin the earliest dated london august and addressed to mrs franklin at philadelphia he was then in england as agent for the colonies in their resistance to the oppressive policy of mr grenville s administration the letter however makes no reference to political or other business it contains only ten or twelve lines

doing so carts and carriages began to appear hurrying down the avenue towards him i suppose that the sale is over he muttered to himself well like death it is a good thing to have done with then he turned to go but hearing the crunch of wheels close at hand stepped back into the shadow of the gateway pillar fearing lest he should be recognised on the open road a carriage came up and just as it reached the gates something being amiss with the harness a footman descended from the box to set it right from where he stood leonard could see its occupants the wife and daughter of a neighbouring squire and overhear their conversation he knew them well indeed the younger lady had been one of his favourite partners at the county balls how cheap the things went ida fancy buying that old oak sideboard for ten pounds and with all those outram quarterings on it too it is as good as an historical document and i am sure that it must be worth at least fifty i shall sell ours and put it into the dining room i have coveted that sideboard for years the daughter sighed and answered with some asperity i am so sorry for the outrams that i should not care about the sideboard if you had got it for twopence what an awful smash just think of the old place being bought by a jew tom and leonard are utterly ruined they say not a sixpence left i declare i nearly cried when i saw that man selling leonard s guns very sad indeed answered the mother absently but if he is a jew what does it matter he has a title and they say that he is enormously rich i expect there will be plenty going on at outram soon by the way my dear ida i do wish you would cure yourself of the habit of calling young men by their christian names not that it matters about these two for we shall never see any more of them i am sure i hope that we shall said ida defiantly and when we do i shall call them by their christian names as much as ever you never objected to it before the smash and i love both of them so there why did you bring me to that horrid sale you know i did not want to go i shall be wretched for a week i and the carriage swept on out of hearing leonard emerged from the shadow of the gateway and crossed the road swiftly on the further side of it he paused and looking after the retreating carriage said aloud god bless you for your kind heart ida hatherley good luck go with you and now for the other business a hundred yards or so down the road was a second gate of much less imposing appearance than those which led to the outram hall leonard passed through it and presently found himself at the door of a square red brick house built with no other pretensions than to those of comfort this was the rectory now tenanted by the reverend and honourable james beach to whom the living had been presented many years before by leonard s father mr beach s old college friend leonard rang the bell and as its distant clamour fell upon his ears a new fear struck him what sort of reception would he meet with in this house he wondered hitherto his welcome had always been so cordial that until this moment he had never doubted of it but now circumstances were changed he was no longer in the position of second son to sir thomas outram of outram hall he was a beggar an outcast a wanderer the son of a fraudulent bankrupt and suicide the careless words of the woman in the carriage had let a flood of light into his mind and by it he saw many things which he had never seen before now he remembered a little motto that he had often heard but the full force of which he did not appreciate until to day friends follow fortune was the wording of this motto he remembered also another saying that had frequently been read to him in church and elsewhere and the origin of which precluded all doubt as to its truth unto every one that hath shall be given but from him that hath not shall be taken away even that which he hath now as it chanced leonard beggared as he was had still something left which could be taken away from him and that something the richest fortune which providence can give to any man in his youth the love of a woman whom he also loved the reverend and honourable james beach was blessed with a daughter jane by name who had the reputation not undeserved of being the most beautiful and sweetest natured girl that the country side could show now being dark and fair respectively and having lived in close association since childhood leonard and jane as might be expected from the working of the laws of natural economy had gravitated towards each other with increasing speed ever since they had come to understand the possibilities of the institution of marriage in the end thus mutual gravitation led to a shock and confusion of individualities which was not without its charm or to put the matter more plainly leonard proposed to jane and had been accepted with many blushes and some tears and kisses it was a common little romance enough but like everything else with which youth and love are concerned it had its elements of beauty such affairs gain much from being the first in the series who is there among us that does not adore his first love and his first poem and yet when we see them twenty years after presently the rectory door was opened and leonard entered at this moment it occurred to him that he did not quite know why he had come to be altogether accurate he knew why he had come well enough it was to see jane and arrive at an understanding with her father perhaps it may be well to explain that his engagement to that young lady was of the suppressed order her parents had no wish to suppress it indeed for though leonard was a younger son it was well known that he was destined to inherit his mother s

any such romance as the adventure of courtrai where the medi val shopkeepers more than won their spurs for they won the spurs of their enemies i have a very simple motive and excuse for telling the little i know of this true tale i have met in my wanderings a man brought up in the lower quarters of a great house fed mainly on its leavings and burdened mostly with its labours i know that his complaints are stilled and his status justified by a story that is told to him it is about how his grandfather was a chimpanzee and his father a wild man of the woods caught by hunters and tamed into something like intelligence in the light of this he may well be thankful for the almost human life that he enjoys and may be content with the hope of leaving behind him a yet more evolved animal strangely enough the calling of this story by the sacred name of progress ceased to satisfy me when i began to suspect and to discover that it is not true i know by now enough at least of his origin to know that he was not evolved but simply disinherited his family tree is not a monkey tree save in the sense that no monkey could have climbed it rather it is like that tree torn up by the roots and named dedischado on the shield of the unknown knight ii the province of britain the land on which we live once had the highly poetic privilege of being the end of the world its extremity was ultima thule the other end of nowhere when these islands lost in a night of northern seas were lit up at last by the long searchlights of rome it was felt that the remotest remnant of things had been touched and more for pride than possession the sentiment was not unsuitable even in geography about these realms upon the edge of everything there was really something that can only be called edgy britain is not so much an island as an archipelago it is at least a labyrinth of peninsulas in few of the kindred countries can one so easily and so strangely find sea in the fields or fields in the sea the great rivers seem not only to meet in the ocean but barely to miss each other in the hills the whole land though low as a whole leans towards the west in shouldering mountains and a prehistoric tradition has taught it to look towards the sunset for islands yet dreamier than its own the islanders are of a kind with their islands different as are the nations into which they are now divided the scots the english the irish the welsh of the western uplands have something altogether different from the humdrum docility of the inland germans or from the bon sens fran ais which can be at will trenchant or trite there is something common to all the britons which even acts of union have not torn asunder the nearest name for it is insecurity something fitting in men walking on cliffs and the verge of things adventure a lonely taste in liberty a humour without wit perplex their critics and perplex themselves their souls are fretted like their coasts they have an embarrassment noted by all foreigners it is expressed perhaps in the irish by a confusion of speech and in the english by a confusion of thought for the irish bull is a license with the symbol of language but bull s own bull the english bull is a dumb ox of thought a standing mystification in the mind there is something double in the thoughts as of the soul mirrored in many waters of all peoples they are least attached to the purely classical the imperial plainness which the french do finely and the germans coarsely but the britons hardly at all they are constantly colonists and emigrants they have the name of being at home in every country but they are in exile in their own country they are torn between love of home and love of something else of which the sea may be the explanation or may be only the symbol it is also found in a nameless nursery rhyme which is the finest line in english literature and the dumb refrain of all english poems over the hills and far away the great rationalist hero who first conquered britain whether or no he was the detached demigod of c sar and cleopatra was certainly a latin of the latins and described these islands when he found them with all the curt positivism of his pen of steel but even julius c sar s brief account of the britons leaves on us something of this mystery which is more than ignorance of fact they were apparently ruled by that terrible thing a pagan priesthood stones now shapeless yet arranged in symbolic shapes bear witness to the order and labour of those that lifted them their worship was probably nature worship and while such a basis may count for something in the elemental quality that has always soaked the island arts the collision between it and the tolerant empire suggests the presence of something which generally grows out of nature worship i mean the unnatural but upon nearly all the matters of modern controversy c sar is silent he is silent about whether the language was celtic and some of the place names have even given rise to a suggestion that in parts at least it was already teutonic i am not capable of pronouncing upon the truth of such speculations but i am of pronouncing upon their importance at least to my own very simple purpose and indeed their importance has been very much exaggerated c sar professed to give no more than the glimpse of a traveller but when some considerable time after the romans returned and turned britain into a roman province they continued to display a singular indifference to questions that have excited so many professors what they cared about was getting and giving in britain

till we had to go down and get our own ice water of the lingering room clerk after the last bell boy had winked out ii but in europe everything is permanent and in america everything is provisional this is the great distinction which if always kept in mind will save a great deal of idle astonishment it is in nothing more apparent than in the preparation here at scheveningen for centuries of summer visitors while at our long island hotel there was a losing bet on a scant generation of them when it seemed likely that it might be a winning bet the sand was planked there in front of the hotel to the sea with spruce boards it was very handsomely planked but it was never afterwards touched apparently for any manner of repairs here for half a mile the dune on which the hotel stands is shored up with massive masonry and bricked for carriages and tiled for foot passengers and it is all kept as clean as if wheel or foot had never passed over it i am sure that there is not a broken brick or a broken tile in the whole length or breadth of it but the hotel here is not a bet it is a business it has come to stay and on long island it had come to see how it would like it beyond the walk and drive however the dunes are left to the winds and to the vegetation with which the dutch planting clothes them against the winds first a coarse grass or rush is sown then a finer herbage comes then a tough brushwood with flowers and blackberry vines so that while the seaward slopes of the dunes are somewhat patched and tattered the landward side and all the pleasant hollows between are fairly held against such gales as on long island blow the lower dunes hither and yon the sheep graze in the valleys at some points in many a little pocket of the dunes i found a potato patch of about the bigness of a city lot and on week days i saw wooden shod men slowly slowly gathering in the crop on sundays i saw the pleasant nooks and corners of these sandy hillocks devoted as the dunes of long island were to whispering lovers who are here as freely and fearlessly affectionate as at home rocking there is not and cannot be in the nature of things as there used to be at mount desert but what is called twoing at york harbor is perfectly practicable it is practicable not only in the nooks and corners of the dunes but on discreeter terms in those hooded willow chairs so characteristic of the dutch sea side these if faced in pairs towards each other must be as favorable to the exchange of vows as of opinions and if the crowd is ever very great perhaps one chair could be made to hold two persons it was distinctly a pang the other day to see men carrying them up from the beach and putting them away to hibernate in the basement of the hotel not all but most of them were taken though i dare say that on fine days throughout october they will go trooping back to the sands on the heads of the same men like a procession of monstrous two legged crabs such a day was last sunday and then the beach offered a lively image of its summer gayety it was dotted with hundreds of hooded chairs which foregathered in gossiping groups or confidential couples and as the sun shone quite warm the flaps of the little tents next the dunes were let down against it and ladies in summer white saved themselves from sunstroke in their shelter the wooden booths for the sale of candies and mineral waters and beer and sandwiches were flushed with a sudden prosperity so that when i went to buy my pound of grapes from the good woman who understands my dutch i dreaded an indifference in her which by no means appeared she welcomed me as warmly as if i had been her sole customer and did not put up the price on me perhaps because it was already so very high that her imagination could not rise above it the hotel showed the same admirable constancy the restaurant was thronged with new comers who spread out even over the many tabled esplanade before it but it was in no wise demoralized that night we sat down in multiplied numbers to a table d hote of serenely unconscious perfection and we permanent guests alas we are now becoming transient too were used with unfaltering recognition of our superior worth we shared the respect which all over europe attaches to establishment and which sometimes makes us poor americans wish for a hereditary nobility so that we could all mirror our ancestral value in the deference of our inferiors where we should get our inferiors is another thing but i suppose we could import them for the purpose if the duties were not too great under our tariff we have not yet imported the idea of a european hotel in any respect though we long ago imported what we call the european plan no travelled american knows it in the extortionate prices of rooms when he gets home or the preposterous charges of our restaurants where one portion of roast beef swimming in a lake of lukewarm juice costs as much as a diversified and delicate dinner in germany or holland but even if there were any proportion in these things the european hotel will not be with us till we have the european portier who is its spring and inspiration

saying he went off at a fast run the horses trotting behind him a mile above he reached the spot he had spoken of the river was narrower here and the stream was running with great rapidity swirling and heaving as it went but with a smooth even surface two hundred yards farther up the boy said is the beginning of the deep if you take the water there you will get across so as to climb up by that sloping bank just opposite he led the way to the spot he indicated and then plunged into the stream swimming quietly and steadily across and allowing the stream to drift him down the horsemen followed his example they had swum many a swollen river and although their horses snorted and plunged at first they soon quieted down and swam steadily over they just struck the spot which the boy had indicated he had already arrived there and without a word trotted forward it was soon dark and the horsemen were obliged to keep close to his heels to see his figure it was as much as they could do to keep up with him for the ground was rough and broken sometimes swampy sometimes strewn with boulders it is well we have a guide colonel munro said to his companion for assuredly even had we got safely

commandant erminio smiled approvingly what one suspects does not count he said in this land of the shadow one suspects everything and everybody there are even envious and avaricious men on the coast

man who wore white duck and a wide gray hat also plied a dripping blade just clear of the awning astern which was a very unusual thing in that region it is certainly the englishman ormsgill said dom erminio that is a man the fever cannot kill which is perhaps a pity then he waved his cigarette again still it is possible that headman domingo will settle with him some day the canoe slid up to the pile bound bank and the two white men who got out strode towards the residency which was characteristic since on a day of that kind an iberian would certainly have sauntered the first of them was tall and thinner even than most white men are who have had the flesh melted from them in tropical africa his face was hollow though he was apparently only some thirty years of age but it was the face of a strong willed man and there was a certain suggestion of optimism in it and his eyes which was singularly unusual in the case of a man who had spent several years in that country even nature is malignant there and man is steeped in lust and avarice and cruelty but in spite of this watson nares was an optimist as well as an american medical missionary he returned the commandant s greeting which was punctiliously courteous and sitting down in the chair a negro brought for him waited until his companion who had turned to give an order to the canoe boys came up the latter was of average height a strongly built man of about the missionary s age with a brick red face fair hair thinned by fever and wrinkles about his gray eyes they were steady observant eyes though a half cynical half whimsical twinkle crept into them now and then as it did when he glanced towards the commandant the latter would have clapped his shoulder but he avoided the effusive greeting with a certain quiet tactfulness which was usual with him the padre and i are going back to the concession he said in portuguese if you have any hammock boys we would like to borrow them the commandant said that this was unfortunately not the case two of his carriers had dysentery and another a guinea worm in his leg and there was only the little twinkle in ormsgill s eyes to show that he did not believe him besides said lieutenant luiz the country is not safe there is a rumor that the abbatava men are watching the lower road ormsgill laughed though he fancied that dom erminio had flashed a quick glance at his subordinate before the latter spoke still i scarcely think the abbatava people will trouble me and in any case some of them would be sorry if they did he said well since you have no carriers we will get on again it is a long way to the concession and lamartine is very ill i brought up the padre to see if he could do anything for him dom erminio shrugged his shoulders it is a wasted effort which is a thing to be regretted in this land where an effort is difficult to make lamartine has been ill too often and if he is ill again he will certainly die as you have heard the bushmen are in an unsettled state and there are several sick men here it is perhaps convenient that the se or nares should stay at san roque he made a little suggestive gesture which seemed to indicate that the road was unsafe turning towards his subordinate as though for confirmation but once more ormsgill fancied there was a warning in his glance of a surety said the lieutenant luiz lamartine is probably not alive by now still if the se or nares insists on going it is well that he should take the higher road in the meantime the canoe boys had unrolled a canvas hammock and lashed it to its pole nares stood up as they approached the veranda stairway with the pole upon their wooly crowns i will come back and look at your sick he said we have only the one hammock ormsgill ormsgill smiled there is nothing

market the thing looked pretty good john so i lent him a thousand of your money quite right returned uncle john nodding but pretty soon he came back with a sad tale he was in a bad fix another fellow was contesting his patent and fighting hard to head him off it would take a lot of money to fight back three thousand at least but he was decent about it after all his father had left him a little farm at millville he couldn t say what it was worth but there were sixty acres and some good buildings and he would deed it to you as security if you would let him have three thousand more so you took the farm and gave him the money i did sir perhaps i am to blame but i liked the young fellow s looks he was clean cut and frank and believed in his pump i did more at the climax of the struggle i gave another thousand making five thousand in all well it s gone john and you ve got the farm the other fellows were too clever for my young friend joseph wegg and knocked out his patent i m so sorry said patsy sympathetically the major coughed it s not an unusual tale my dear especially when john advances the money he replied what became of the young man asked the girl he s a competent chauffeur and so he went to work driving an automobile where is millville inquired uncle john thoughtfully somewhere at the north of the state i believe have you investigated the farm at all i looked up a real estate dealer living at millville and wrote him about the wegg farm he said if any one wanted the place very badly it might sell for three thousand dollars humph but his best information was to the effect that no one wanted it at all patsy laughed poor uncle john she said the little man however was serious for a time he ate with great deliberation and revolved an interesting thought in his mind years ago said he i lived in a country town and i love the smell of the meadows and the hum of the bees in the orchards any orchards at my farm major don t know sir pretty soon continued uncle john it s going to be dreadfully hot in new york and we ll have to get away seashore s the place remarked the major atlantic city or swampscott or rubbish growled the other man impatiently the girls and i have just come from europe we ve had enough sea to last us all this season at least what we pine for is country life pure milk apple trees and new mown hay we uncle said patsy yes my dear a couple of months on the farm will do all of my nieces good beth is still with louise you know and they must find the city deadly dull just now the farm s the thing and the major can run up to see us for a couple of weeks in the hot weather and we ll all have a glorious lazy time and we can take mary along to do the cooking suggested patsy entering into the idea enthusiastically and eat in our shirt sleeves said uncle john with a glowing face and have a cow and some pigs cried the girl pah said the major scornfully you talk as if it were a real farm instead of a place no one would have as a gift uncle john looked sober again anyone live on the place major he inquired i believe not it s gone to ruin and decay the last few years but it could be put into shape perhaps so at an expense that will add to your loss never mind that if you want farm life why don t you rent a respectable farm demanded the major no this is my farm i own it and it s my bounded duty to live on it said uncle john stubbornly write to that real estate fellow at millville tomorrow and tell him to have the place fixed up and put into ship shape order as quickly as possible tell him to buy some cows and pigs and chickens and hire a man to look after them also a horse and buggy some saddle horses go slow john don t leave such a job to a country real estate dealer if i remember right the fellow wrote like a blacksmith if you want horses and rigs let hutchinson send you down the right sort with an experienced groom and stable hands but i m not sure there will be a place to put them oh uncle exclaimed patsy don t let us have all those luxuries let us live a simple life on the farm and not degrade its charms by adding city fixin s the cow and the chickens are all right but let s cut out the horses until we get there don t you know dear that a big establishment means lots of servants and servants mean worry and strife i want to let down the bars for the cow when she moos and milk her myself it takes a skilled mechanic to milk a cow objected the major but patsy s right cried her uncle with conviction we don t want any frills at all just tell your man major to put the place into good living

temple he and i regarded ourselves as the ministers we held justly as i think that we had done more for his memory than anyone else and we had done it by opening lights into his life he had nothing to fear from us because he had nothing to fear from the truth which alone at such a distance of time we could be interested in establishing his early death had been the only dark spot in his life unless the papers in miss bordereau s hands should perversely bring out others there had been an impression about that he had treated her badly just as there had been an impression that he had served as the london populace says several other ladies in the same way each of these cases cumnor and i had been able to investigate and we had never failed to acquit him conscientiously of shabby behavior i judged him perhaps more indulgently than my friend certainly at any rate it appeared to me that no man could have walked straighter in the given circumstances these were almost always awkward half the women of his time to speak liberally had flung themselves at his head and out of this pernicious fashion many complications some of them grave had not failed to arise he was not a woman s poet as i had said to mrs prest in the modern phase of his reputation but the situation had been different when the man s own voice was mingled with his song that voice by every testimony was one of the sweetest ever heard orpheus and the maenads was the exclamation that rose to my lips when i first turned over his correspondence almost all the maenads were unreasonable and many of them insupportable it struck me in short that he was kinder more considerate than in his place if i could imagine myself in such a place i should have been it was certainly strange beyond all strangeness and i shall not take up space with attempting to explain it that whereas in all these other lines of research we had to deal with phantoms and dust the mere echoes of echoes the one living source of information that had lingered on into our time had been unheeded by us every one of aspern s contemporaries had according to our belief passed away we had not been able to look into a single pair of eyes into which his had looked or to feel a transmitted contact in any aged hand that his had touched most dead of all did poor miss bordereau appear and yet she alone had survived we exhausted in the course of months our wonder that we had not found her out sooner and the substance of our explanation was that she had kept so quiet the poor lady on the whole had had reason for doing so but it was a revelation to us that it was possible to keep so quiet as that in the latter half of the nineteenth century the age of newspapers and telegrams and photographs and interviewers and she had taken no great trouble about it either she had not hidden herself away in an undiscoverable hole she had boldly settled down in a city of exhibition the only secret of her safety that we could perceive was that venice contained so many curiosities that were greater than she and then accident had somehow favored her as was shown for example in the fact that mrs prest had never happened to mention her to me though i had spent three weeks in venice under her nose as it were five years before mrs prest had not mentioned this much to anyone she appeared almost to have forgotten she was there of course she had not the responsibilities of an editor it was no explanation of the old woman s having eluded us to say that she lived abroad for our researches had again and again taken us not only by correspondence but by personal inquiry to france to germany to italy in which countries not counting his important stay in england so many of the too few years of aspern s career were spent we were glad to think at least that in all our publishings some people consider i believe that we have overdone them we had only touched in passing and in the most discreet manner on miss bordereau s connection oddly enough even if we had had the material and we often wondered what had become of it it would have been the most difficult episode to handle the gondola stopped the old palace was there it was a house of the class which in venice carries even in extreme dilapidation the dignified name how charming it s gray and pink my companion exclaimed and that is the most comprehensive description of it it was not particularly old only two or three centuries and it had an air not so much of decay as of quiet discouragement as if it had rather missed its career but its wide front with a stone balcony from end to end of the piano nobile or most important floor was architectural enough with the aid of various pilasters and arches and the stucco with which in the intervals it had long ago been endued was rosy in the april afternoon it overlooked a clean melancholy unfrequented canal which had a narrow riva or convenient footway on either side i don t know why there are no brick gables said mrs prest but this corner has seemed to me before more dutch than italian more like amsterdam than like venice it s perversely clean for reasons of its own and though you can pass on foot scarcely anyone ever thinks of doing so it has the air of a protestant sunday perhaps the people are afraid of the misses bordereau i daresay they have the reputation of witches i forget what answer i made to this i was given up to two other reflections the first of these was that if the old lady lived in such a big imposing house she could not be in any sort of misery and therefore would not be tempted by a chance to let a couple of rooms i expressed this idea to mrs prest who gave me a very logical reply if she didn t live in a big house how could it be a question of her having rooms to spare if she were not amply

culture and of refinement comes to be masquerading as a street dancer the game is a dangerous one as you have experienced to night it is no game monsieur citizen she stammered nor yet a masquerade i have been a street dancer all my life and by way of an answer he took her hand always with that air of authority which she never thought to resent this is not a street dancer s hand madame he said quietly nor is your speech that of the people she drew her hand away quickly and the flush on her haggard face deepened if you will honour me with your confidence madame he insisted the kindly words the courtesy of the man went to the poor creature s heart she fell back upon the sofa and with her face buried in her arms she sobbed out her heart for a minute or two the man waited quite patiently he had seen many women weep these days and had dried many a tear through deeds of valour and of self sacrifice which were for ever recorded in the hearts of those whom he had succoured when this poor woman had succeeded in recovering some semblance of self control she turned her wan tear stained face to him and said simply my name is madeleine lannoy monsieur my husband was killed during the emeutes at versailles whilst defending the persons of the queen and of the royal children against the fury of the mob when i was a girl i had the misfortune to attract the attentions of a young doctor named jean paul marat you have heard of him monsieur the other nodded you know him perhaps she continued for what he is the most cruel and revengeful of men a few years ago he threw up his lucrative appointment as court physician to monseigneur le comte d artois and gave up the profession of medicine for that of journalist and politician politician heaven help him he belongs to the most bloodthirsty section of revolutionary brigands his creed is pillage murder and revenge and he chooses to declare that it is i who by rejecting his love drove him to these foul extremities may god forgive him that abominable lie the evil we do monsieur is within us it does not come from circumstance i in the meanwhile was a happy wife my husband m de lannoy who was an officer in the army idolised me we had one child a boy she paused with another catch in her throat then she resumed with calmness that in view of the tale she told sounded strangely weird in june last year my child was stolen from me stolen by marat in hideous revenge for the supposed wrong which i had done him the details of that execrable outrage are of no importance i was decoyed from home one day through the agency of a forged message purporting to come from a very dear friend whom i knew to be in grave trouble at the time oh the whole thing was thoroughly well thought out i can assure you she continued with a harsh laugh which ended in a heartrending sob the forged message the suborned servant the threats of terrible reprisals if anyone in the village gave me the slightest warning or clue when the whole miserable business was accomplished i was just like a trapped animal inside a cage held captive by immovable bars of obstinate silence and cruel indifference no one would help me no one ostensibly knew anything no one had seen anything heard anything the child was gone my servants the people in the village some of whom i could have sworn were true and sympathetic only shrugged their shoulders que voulez vous madame children of bourgeois as well as of aristos were often taken up by the state to be brought up as true patriots and no longer pampered like so many lap dogs three days later i received a letter from that inhuman monster jean paul marat he told me that he had taken my child away from me not from any idea of revenge for my disdain in the past but from a spirit of pure patriotism my boy he said should not be brought up with the same ideas of bourgeois effeteness and love of luxury which had disgraced the nation for centuries no he should be reared amongst men who had realised the true value of fraternity and equality and the ideal of complete liberty for the individual to lead his own life unfettered by senseless prejudices of education and refinement which means monsieur the poor woman went on with passionate misery that my child is to be reared up in the company of all that is most vile and most degraded in the disease haunted slums of indigent paris that with the connivance of that execrable fiend marat my only son will mayhap come back to me one day a potential thief a criminal probably a drink sodden reprobate at best such things are done every day in this glorious revolution of ours done in the sacred name of france and of liberty and the moral murder of my child is to be my punishment for daring to turn a deaf ear to the indign passion of a brute once more she paused and when the melancholy echo of her broken voice had died away in the narrow room not another murmur broke the stillness of this far away corner of the great city the man did not move he stood looking down upon the poor woman before him a world of pity expressed in his deep set eyes through the absolute silence around there came the sound as of a gentle flutter the current of cold air mayhap sighing through the ill fitting shutters or the soft weird soughing made by unseen things the man s heart was full of pity and it seemed as if the angel of compassion had come at his bidding and enfolded the sorrowing woman with his wings a moment or two later she was able to finish her pathetic narrative do you

for themselves in his books he prefers to count the hits and leave the reckoning of the misses to those who will find a pleasure in it of course these prophecies of the writer s were made upon a basis of very generalised knowledge what can be done by a really sustained research into a particular question especially if it is a question essentially mechanical is shown by the work of a frenchman all too neglected by the trumpet of fame clement ader m ader was probably the first man to get a mechanism up into the air for something more than a leap his eole as general mensier testifies prolonged a jump as far as fifty metres as early as in his avion fairly flew this is a year ahead of the date of my earliest photograph of s p langley s aeropile in mid air this however is beside our present mark the fact of interest here is that in when flying was still almost incredible m ader published his aviation militaire well that was eight years ago and men have been fighting in the air now for a year and there is still nothing being done that m ader did not see and which we if we had had the wisdom to attend to him might not have been prepared for there is much that he foretells which is still awaiting its inevitable fulfilment so clearly can men of adequate knowledge and sound reasoning power see into the years ahead in all such matters of material development but it is not with the development of mechanical inventions that the writer now proposes to treat in this book he intends to hazard certain forecasts about the trend of events in the next decade or so mechanical novelties will probably play a very small part in that coming history this world wide war means a general arrest of invention and enterprise except in the direction of the war business ability is concentrated upon that the types of ability that are not applicable to warfare are neglected there is a vast destruction of capital and a waste of the savings that are needed to finance new experiments moreover we are killing off many of our brightest young men it is fairly safe to assume that there will be very little new furniture on the stage of the world for some considerable time that if there is much difference in the roads and railways and shipping it will be for the worse that architecture domestic equipment and so on will be fortunate if in they stand where they did in the spring of in the trenches of france and flanders and on the battlefields of russia the germans have been spending and making the world spend the comfort the luxury and the progress of the next quarter century there is no accounting for tastes but the result is that while it was possible for the writer in to write anticipations of the reaction of mechanical progress upon human life and thought in his anticipations must belong to quite another system of consequences the broad material facts before us are plain enough it is the mental facts that have to be unravelled it isn t now a question of what thing what faculty what added power will come to hand and how will it affect our ways of living it is a question of how are people going to take these obvious things waste of the world s resources arrest of material progress the killing of a large moiety of the males in nearly every european country and universal loss and unhappiness we are going to deal with realities here at once more intimate and less accessible than the effects of mechanism as a preliminary reconnaissance as it were over the region of problems we have to attack let us consider the difficulties of a single question which is also a vital and central question in this forecast we shall not attempt a full answer here because too many of the factors must remain unexamined later perhaps we may be in a better position to do so this question is the probability of the establishment of a long world peace at the outset of the war there was a very widely felt hope among the intellectuals of the world that this war might clear up most of the outstanding international problems and prove the last war the writer looking across the gulf of experience that separates us from recalls two pamphlets whose very titles are eloquent of this feeling the war that will end war and the peace of the world was the hope expressed in those phrases a dream is it already proven a dream or can we read between the lines of the war news diplomatic disputations threats and accusations political wranglings and stories of hardship and cruelty that now fill our papers anything that still justifies a hope that these bitter years of world sorrow are the darkness before the dawn of a better day for mankind let us handle this problem for a preliminary examination what is really being examined here is the power of human reason to prevail over passion and certain other restraining and qualifying forces there can be little doubt that if one could canvass all mankind and ask them whether they would rather have no war any more the overwhelming mass of them would elect for universal peace if it were war of the modern mechanical type that was in question with air raids high explosives poison gas and submarines there could be no doubt at all about the response give peace in our time o lord is more than ever the common prayer of christendom and the very war makers claim to be peace makers the german emperor has never faltered in his assertion that he encouraged austria to send an impossible ultimatum to serbia and invaded belgium because germany was being attacked the krupp kaiser empire he assures us is no eagle but a double

as a present for my mother it must be confessed however that some of our men behaved very badly in this matter of the statues and the pictures the people at venice were very much attached to them and as to the four bronze horses which stood over the gate of their great church they loved them as dearly as if they had been their children i have always been a judge of a horse and i had a good look at these ones but i could not see that there was much to be said for them they were too coarse limbed for light cavalry charges and they had not the weight for the gun teams however they were the only four horses alive or dead in the whole town so it was not to be expected that the people would know any better they wept bitterly when they were sent away and ten french soldiers were found floating in the canals that night as a punishment for these murders a great many more of their pictures were sent away and the soldiers took to breaking the statues and firing their muskets at the stained glass windows this made the people furious and there was very bad feeling in the town many officers and men disappeared during that winter and even their bodies were never found for myself i had plenty to do and i never found the time heavy on my hands in every country it has been my custom to try to learn the language for this reason i always look round for some lady who will be kind enough to teach it to me and then we practise it together this is the most interesting way of picking it up and before i was thirty i could speak nearly every tongue in europe but it must be confessed that what you learn is not of much use for the ordinary purposes of life my business for example has usually been with soldiers and peasants and what advantage is it to be able to say to them that i love only them and that i will come back when the wars are over never have i had so sweet a teacher as in venice lucia was her first name and her second but a gentleman forgets second names i can say this with all discretion that she was of one of the senatorial families of venice and that her grandfather had been doge of the town she was of an exquisite beauty and when i etienne gerard use such a word as exquisite my friends it has a meaning i have judgment i have memories i have the means of comparison of all the women who have loved me there are not twenty to whom i could apply such a term as that but i say again that lucia was exquisite of the dark type i do not recall her equal unless it were dolores of toledo there was a little brunette whom i loved at santarem when i was soldiering under massena in portugal her name has escaped me she was of a perfect beauty but she had not the figure nor the grace of lucia there was agnes also i could not put one before the other but i do none an injustice when i say that lucia was the equal of the best it was over this matter of pictures that i had first met her for her father owned a palace on the farther side of the rialto bridge upon the grand canal and it was so packed with wall paintings that suchet sent a party of sappers to cut some of them out and send them to paris i had gone down with them and after i had seen lucia in tears it appeared to me that the plaster would crack if it were taken from the support of the wall i said so and the sappers were withdrawn after that i was the friend of the family and many a flask of chianti have i cracked with the father and many a sweet lesson have i had from the daughter some of our french officers married in venice that winter and i might have done the same for i loved her with all my heart but etienne gerard has his sword his horse his regiment his mother his emperor and his career a debonair hussar has room in his life for love but none for a wife so i thought then my friends but i did not see the lonely days when i should long to clasp those vanished hands and turn my head away when i saw old comrades with their tall children standing round their chairs this love which i had thought was a joke and a plaything it is only now that i understand that it is the moulder of one s life the most solemn and sacred of all things thank you my friend thank you it is a good wine and a second bottle cannot hurt and now i will tell you how my love for lucia was the cause of one of the most terrible of all the wonderful adventures which have ever befallen me and how it was that i came to lose the top of my right ear you have often asked me why it was missing to night for the first time i will tell you suchet s head quarters at that time was the old palace of the doge dandolo which stands on the lagoon not far from the place of san marco it was near the end of the winter and i had returned one night from the theatre goldini when i found a note from lucia and a gondola waiting she prayed me to come to her at once as she was in trouble to a frenchman and a soldier there was but one answer to such a note in an instant i was in the boat and the gondolier was pushing out into the dark lagoon i remember that as i took my seat in the boat i was struck by the man s great size he was not tall but he was one of the broadest men that i have ever seen in my life but the gondoliers of venice are a strong breed and powerful men are common enough among them the fellow took his place behind me and began to row a good soldier in an enemy s country should everywhere and at all times be on the alert it has been one of the rules of my life and if i have lived to wear grey hairs it is because i have observed it and yet upon that night i was as careless as a foolish young recruit who fears lest he should be thought to be afraid my pistols i had left behind in my hurry my sword was at my belt but it is not always the most convenient of weapons i lay bac

brewster of the connecticut contingent continued the girl with an affected raising of a low pathetic voice that was however inaudible beyond the tree capt brewster behold me your obleeged and humble servant and sweetheart to command capt brewster succeeded after a slight skirmish at the wall in possessing himself of the girl s hand at which although still struggling she relented slightly it isn t every lad that i d low for she said with an affected pout and there may be others that would not take it amiss though there be fine ladies enough at the assembly halls at morristown as might think it hoydenish nonsense love said the captain who had by this time mounted the wall and encircled the girl s waist with his arm nonsense you startled me only but he added suddenly taking her round chin in his hand and turning her face toward the moon with an uneasy half suspicion why did you take that light from the window what has happened we had unexpected guests sweetheart said thankful the count just arrived that infernal hessian he stopped and gazed questioningly into her face the moon looked upon her at the same time the face was as sweet as placid as truthful as her own possibly these two inconstants understood each other nay allan he is not a hessian but an exiled gentleman from abroad a nobleman there are no noblemen now sniffed the trooper contemptuously congress has so decreed it all men are born free and equal but they are not allan said thankful with a pretty trouble in her brows even cows are not born equal is yon calf that was dropped last night by brindle the equal of my red heifer whose mother come by herself in a ship from surrey do they look equal titles are but breath said capt brewster doggedly there was an ominous pause nay there is one nobleman left said thankful and he is my own my nature s nobleman capt brewster did not reply from certain arch gestures and wreathed smiles with which this forward young woman accompanied her statement it would seem to be implied that the gentleman who stood before her was the nobleman alluded to at least he so accepted it and embraced her closely her arms and part of her mantle clinging around his neck in this attitude they remained quiet for some moments slightly rocking from side to side like a metronome a movement i fancy peculiarly bucolic pastoral and idyllic and as such i wot observed by theocritus and virgil at these supreme moments weak woman usually keeps her wits about her much better than your superior reasoning masculine animal and while the gallant captain was losing himself upon her perfect lips miss thankful distinctly heard the farm gate click and otherwise noticed that the moon was getting high and obtrusive she half released herself from the captain s arms thoughtfully and tenderly but firmly tell me all about yourself allan dear she said quietly making room for him on the wall all everything she turned upon him her beautiful eyes eyes habitually earnest and even grave in expression yet holding in their brave brown depths a sweet childlike reliance and dependency eyes with a certain tender deprecating droop in the brown fringed lids and yet eyes that seemed to say to every man who looked upon them i am truthful be frank with me indeed i am convinced there is not one of my impressible sex who looking in those pleading eyes would not have perjured himself on the spot rather than have disappointed their fair owner capt brewster s mouth resumed its old expression of discontent everything is growing worse thankful and the cause is lost congress does nothing and washington is not the man for the crisis instead of marching to philadelphia and forcing that wretched rabble of hancock and adams at the point of the bayonet he writes letters a dignified formal old fool interrupted mistress thankful indignantly and look at his wife didn t mistress ford and mistress baily ay and the best blood of morris county go down to his excellency s in their finest bibs and tuckers and didn t they find my lady in a pinafore doing chores vastly polite treatment indeed as if the whole world didn t know that the general was taken by surprise when my lady came riding up from virginia with all those fine cavaliers just to see what his excellency was doing at these assembly balls and fine doings i dare say this is but idle gossip thankful said capt brewster with the faintest appearance of self consciousness the assembly balls are conceived by the general to strengthen the confidence of the townsfolk and mitigate the rigors of the winter encampment i go there myself rarely i have but little taste for junketing and gavotting with my country in such need no thankful what we want is a leader and the men of connecticut feel it keenly if i have been spoken of in that regard added the captain with a slight inflation of his manly breast it is because they know of my sacrifices because as new england yeomen they know my devotion to the cause they know of my suffering the bright face that looked into his was suddenly afire with womanly sympathy the pretty brow was knit the sweet eyes overflowed with tenderness forgive me allan i forgot perhaps love

squire took his place close to the curb lou next a little peacocky in her bright and pretty clothes nancy on the inside slender and soberly clothed as the sparrow but with the true van alstyne fisher walk thus they set out for their evening s moderate diversion i do not suppose that many look upon a great department store as an educational institution but the one in which nancy worked was something like that to her she was surrounded by beautiful things that breathed of taste and refinement if you live in an atmosphere of luxury luxury is yours whether your money pays for it or another s the people she served were mostly women whose dress manners and position in the social world were quoted as criterions from them nancy began to take toll the best from each according to her view from one she would copy and practice a gesture from another an eloquent lifting of an eyebrow from others a manner of walking of carrying a purse of smiling of greeting a friend of addressing inferiors in station from her best beloved model mrs van alstyne fisher she made requisition for that excellent thing a soft low voice as clear as silver and as perfect in articulation as the notes of a thrush suffused in the aura of this high social refinement and good breeding it was impossible for her to escape a deeper effect of it as good habits are said to be better than good principles so perhaps good manners are better than good habits the teachings of your parents may not keep alive your new england conscience but if you sit on a straight back chair and repeat the words prisms and pilgrims forty times the devil will flee from you and when nancy spoke in the van alstyne fisher tones she felt the thrill of noblesse oblige to her very bones there was another source of learning in the great departmental school whenever you see three or four shop girls gather in a bunch and jingle their wire bracelets as an accompaniment to apparently frivolous conversation do not think that they are there for the purpose of criticizing the way ethel does her back hair the meeting may lack the dignity of the deliberative bodies of man but it has all the importance of the occasion on which eve and her first daughter first put their heads together to make adam understand his proper place in the household it is woman s conference for common defense and exchange of strategical theories of attack and repulse upon and against the world which is a stage and man its audience who persists in throwing bouquets thereupon woman the most helpless of the young of any animal with the fawn s grace but without its fleetness with the bird s beauty but without its power of flight with the honey bee s burden of sweetness but without its oh let s drop that simile some of us may have been stung

a department store is a wide one perhaps no other college could have fitted her as well for her life s ambition the drawing of a matrimonial prize her station in the store was a favored one the music room was near enough for her to hear and become familiar with the works of the best composers at least to acquire the familiarity that passed for appreciation in the social world in which she was vaguely trying to set a tentative and aspiring foot she absorbed the educating influence of art wares of costly and dainty fabrics of adornments that are almost culture to women the other girls soon

daughter and five extravagant and unpractical sons the eldest stephen entered the church and held the living of salehurst where he offered we may hope an extreme example of the clergy of the age he was a handsome figure of a man jovial and jocular fond of his garden which produced under his care the finest fruits of the neighbourhood and like all the family very choice in horses he drove tandem like jehu furiously his saddle horse captain for the names of horses are piously preserved in the family chronicle which i follow was trained to break into a gallop as soon as the vicar s foot was thrown across its back nor would the rein be drawn in the nine miles between northiam and the vicarage door debt was the man s proper element he used to skulk from arrest in the chancel of his church and the speed of captain may have come sometimes handy at an early age this unconventional parson married his cook and by her he had two daughters and one son one of the daughters died unmarried the other imitated her father and married imprudently the son still more gallantly continuing the tradition entered the army loaded himself with debt was forced to sell out took refuge in the marines and was lost on the dogger bank in the war ship minotaur if he did not marry below him like his father his sister and a certain great uncle william it was perhaps because he never married at all the second brother thomas who was employed in the general post office followed in all material points the example of stephen married not very creditably and spent all the money he could lay his hands on he died without issue as did the fourth brother john who was of weak intellect and feeble health and the fifth brother william whose brief career as one of mrs buckner s satellites will fall to be considered later on so soon then as the minotaur had struck upon the dogger bank stowting and the line of the jenkin family fell on the shoulders of the third brother charles facility and self indulgence are the family marks facility to judge by these imprudent marriages being at once their quality and their defect but in the case of charles a man of exceptional beauty and sweetness both of face and disposition the family fault had quite grown to be a virtue and we find him in consequence the drudge and milk cow of his relatives born in charles served at sea in his youth and smelt both salt water and powder the jenkins had inclined hitherto as far as i can make out to the land service stephen s son had been a soldier william fourth of stowting had been an officer of the unhappy braddock s in america where by the way he owned and afterwards sold an estate on the james river called after the parental seat of which i should like well to hear if it still bears the name it was probably by the influence of captain buckner already connected with the family by his first marriage that charles jenkin turned his mind in the direction of the navy and it was in buckner s own ship the prothee that the lad made his only campaign it was in the days of rodney s war when the prothee we read captured two large privateers to windward of barbadoes and was materially and distinguishedly engaged in both the actions with de grasse while at sea charles kept a journal and made strange archaic pilot book sketches part plan part elevation some of which survive for the amusement of posterity he did a good deal of surveying so that here we may perhaps lay our finger on the beginning of fleeming s education as an engineer what is still more strange among the relics of the handsome midshipman and his stay in the gun room of the prothee i find a code of signals graphically represented for all the world as it would have been done by his grandson on the declaration of peace charles because he had suffered from scurvy received his mother s orders to retire and he was not the man to refuse a request far less to disobey a command thereupon he turned farmer a trade he was to practice on a large scale and we find him married to a miss schirr a woman of some fortune the daughter of a london merchant stephen the not very reverend was still alive galloping about the country or skulking in his chancel it does not appear whether he let or sold the paternal manor to charles one or other it must have been and the sailor farmer settled at stowting with his wife his mother his unmarried sister and his sick brother john out of the six people of whom his nearest family consisted three were in his own house and two others the horse leeches stephen and thomas he appears to have continued to assist with more amiability than wisdom he hunted belonged to the yeomanry owned famous horses maggie and lucy the latter coveted by royalty itself lord rokeby his neighbour called him kinsman writes my artless chronicler and altogether life was very cheery at stowting his three sons john charles and thomas frewen and his younger daughter anna were all born to him and the reader should here be told that it is through the report of this second charles born that he has been looking on at these confused passages of family history in the year the ruin of the

maudlin sentiment with bitter resentment and with an ominous glitter in her bloodshot and glairy eyes peter winced with a consciousness of the half truth of her reproaches but the curiosity and excitement awakened by the revelations of her frenzy were greater than his remorse he said quickly you were speaking of father of his family his lands and possessions tell me again wot are ye givin us

don t want him i ve done with him i was done with him long afore afore a cough checked her utterance afore she gasped again but the words seemed to strangle in her throat intent only on her words and scarcely heeding her sufferings peter was bending over her eagerly when the doctor rudely pulled him away and lifted her to a sitting posture but she never spoke again the strongest restoratives quickly administered only left her in a state of scarcely breathing unconsciousness is she dying can t you bring her to said the anxious peter if only for a moment doctor i m thinkin said the visiting doctor an old scotch army surgeon looking at the rich mr atherly with cool professional contempt that your mother willna do any more washing for me as in the old time nor give up her life again to support her bairns and it isna my eentention to bring her back to pain for the purposes of geeneral conversation nor indeed did she ever come back to any purpose but passed away with her unfinished sentence and her limbs were scarcely decently composed by the attendants before peter was rummaging the trunk in her room for the paper she had spoken of it was in an old work box a now faded yellow clipping from a newspaper lying amidst spoils of cotton thread buttons and beeswax which he even then remembered to have seen upon his mother s lap when she superadded the sewing on of buttons to her washing of the miners shirts and his dark and hollow cheek glowed with gratified sentiment as he read the clipping we hear with regret of the death of philip atherly esq of rough and ready california mr atherly will be remembered by some of our readers as the hero of the romantic elopement of miss sallie magregor daughter of colonel bob magregor which created such a stir in well to do circles some thirty years ago it was known vaguely that the young couple had gone west a then unknown region but it seems that after severe trials and tribulations on the frontier with savages they emigrated early to oregon and then on the outbreak of the gold fever to california but it will be a surprise to many to know that it has just transpired that mr atherly was the second son of sir ashley atherly an english baronet and by the death of his brother might have succeeded to the property and title he remained for some moments looking fixedly at the paper until the commonplace paragraph imprinted itself upon his brain as no line of sage or poet had ever done and then he folded it up and put it in his pocket in his exaltation he felt that even the mother he had never loved was promoted to a certain respect as his father s wife although he was equally conscious of a new resentment against her for her contemptuous allusions to his father and her evident hopeless inability to comprehend his

how is it possible to begin at the beginning without beginning at the kettle it appeared as if there were a sort of match or trial of skill you must understand between the kettle and the cricket and this is what led to it and how it came about mrs peerybingle going out into the raw twilight and clicking over the wet stones in a pair of pattens that worked innumerable rough impressions of the first proposition in euclid all about the yard mrs peerybingle filled the kettle at the water butt presently returning less the pattens and a good deal less for they were tall and mrs peerybingle was but short she set the kettle on the fire in doing which she lost her temper or mislaid it for an instant for the water being uncomfortably cold and in that slippy slushy sleety sort of state wherein it seems to penetrate through every kind of substance patten rings included had laid hold of mrs peerybingle s toes and even splashed her legs and when we rather plume ourselves with reason too upon our legs and keep ourselves particularly neat in point of stockings we find this for the moment hard to bear besides the kettle was aggravating and obstinate it wouldn t allow itself to be adjusted on the top bar it wouldn t hear of accommodating itself kindly to the knobs of coal it would lean forward with a drunken air and dribble a very idiot of a kettle on the hearth it was quarrelsome and hissed and spluttered morosely at the fire to sum up all the lid resisting mrs peerybingle s fingers first of all turned topsy turvy and then with an ingenious pertinacity deserving of a better cause dived sideways in down to the very bottom of the kettle and the hull of the royal george has never made half the monstrous resistance to coming out of the water which the lid of that kettle employed against mrs peerybingle before she got it up again it looked sullen and pig headed enough even then carrying its handle with an air of defiance and cocking its spout pertly and mockingly at mrs peerybingle as if it said i won t boil nothing shall induce me but mrs peerybingle with restored good humour dusted her chubby little hands against each other and sat down before the kettle laughing meantime the jolly blaze uprose and fell flashing and gleaming on the little hay maker at the top of the dutch clock until one might have thought he stood stock still before the moorish palace and nothing was in motion but the flame he was on the move however and had his spasms two to the second all right and regular but his sufferings when the clock was going to strike were frightful to behold and when a cuckoo looked out of a trap door in the palace and gave note six times it shook him each time like a spectral voice or like a something wiry plucking at his legs it was not until a violent commotion and a whirring noise among the weights and ropes below him had quite subsided that this terrified hay maker became himself again nor was he startled without reason for these rattling bony skeletons of clocks are very disconcerting in their operation and i wonder very much how any set of men but most of all how dutchmen can have had a liking to invent them there is a popular belief that dutchmen love broad cases and much clothing for their own lower selves and they might know better than to leave their clocks so very lank and unprotected surely now it was you observe that the kettle began to spend the evening now it was that the kettle growing mellow and musical began to have irrepressible gurglings in its throat and to indulge in short vocal snorts which it checked in the bud as if it hadn t quite made up its mind yet to be good company now it was that after two or three such vain attempts to stifle its convivial sentiments it threw off all moroseness all reserve and burst into a stream of song so cosy and hilarious as never maudlin nightingale yet formed the least idea of so plain too bless you you might have understood it like a book better than some books you and i could name perhaps with its warm breath gushing forth in a light cloud which merrily and gracefully ascended a few feet then hung about the chimney corner as its own domestic heaven it trolled its song with that strong energy of cheerfulness that its iron body hummed and stirred upon the fire and the lid itself the recently rebellious lid such is the influence of a bright example performed a sort of jig and clattered like a deaf and dumb young cymbal that had never known the use of its twin brother that this song of the kettle s was a song of invitation and welcome to somebody out of doors to somebody at that moment coming on towards the snug small home and the crisp fire there is no doubt whatever mrs peerybingle knew it perfectly as she sat musing before the hearth it s a dark night sang the kettle and the rotten leaves are lying by the way and above all is mist and darkness and below all is mire and clay and there s only one relief in all the sad and murky air and i don t know that it is one for it s nothing but a glare of deep and angry crimson where the sun and wind together set a brand upon the clouds for being guilty of such weather and the widest open country is a long dull streak of black and there s hoar frost on the finger post and thaw upon the track and the ice it isn t water and the water isn t free and you couldn t say that anything is what it ought to be but he s coming coming coming and here if you like the cricket did chime in with a chirrup chirrup chirrup of such magnitude by way of chorus with a voice so astoundingly disproportionate to its size as compared with the kettle size you couldn t see it that if it had then and there burst itself like an overcharged gun if it had fallen a victim

of brilliant style and finished dialectics writing as a historian mr seeley exhorts us to look at the eighteenth century in a new light and from a new standpoint which he exhibits with singular skill and power we could only wish that he had been a little less zealous on behalf of its novelty his accents are almost querulous as he complains of historical predecessors for their blindness to what in plain truth we have always supposed that they discerned quite as clearly as he discerns it himself our historians he says miss the true point of view in describing the eighteenth century they make too much of the mere parliamentary wrangle and the agitations about liberty they do not perceive that in that century the history of england is not in england but in america and asia i shall venture to assert he proceeds in another place that the main struggle of england from the time of louis xiv to the time of napoleon was for the possession of the new world and it is for want of perceiving this that most of us find that century of english history uninteresting the same teasing refrain runs through the book we might be disposed to traverse mr seeley s assumption that most of us do find the eighteenth century of english history uninteresting in a great part of it mr seeley assures us we see nothing but stagnation the wars seem to lead to nothing and we do not perceive the working of any new political ideas that time seems to have created little so that we can only think of it as prosperous but not as memorable those dim figures george i and george ii the long tame administrations of walpole and pelham the commercial war with spain the battles of dettingen and fontenoy the foolish prime minister newcastle the dull brawls of the wilkes period the miserable american war everywhere alike we seem to remark a want of greatness a distressing commonness and flatness in men and in affairs this would be very sad if it were true but is it true a plain man rubs his eyes in amazement at such reproaches so far from most of us finding the eighteenth century uninteresting as prosperous rather than memorable as wanting in greatness as distressing by the commonness and the flatness of its men and its affairs we undertake to say that most of us in the sense of most people who read the english language know more about and feel less flatness and are more interested in the names of the eighteenth century than in those of all other centuries put together if we are to talk about popular histories the writer who distances every competitor by an immeasurable distance is macaulay whatever may be said about that illustrious man s style his conception of history his theories of human society it is at least beyond question or denial that his essays have done more than any other writings of this generation to settle the direction of men s historical interest and curiosity from eton and harrow down to an elementary school in st giles s or bethnal green macaulay s essays are a text book at home and in the colonies they are on every shelf between shakespeare and the bible and of all these famous compositions none are so widely read or so well known as those on clive hastings chatham frederick johnson with the gallery of vigorous and animated figures that macaulay grouped round these great historic luminaries we are not now saying that macaulay s view of the actors or the events of the eighteenth century is sound comprehensive philosophical or in any other way meritorious we are only examining the truth of mr seeley s assumption that the century which the most popular writer of the day has treated in his most glowing vivid picturesque and varied style is regarded by the majority of us as destitute of interest as containing neither memorable men nor memorable affairs and as overspread with an ignoble pall of all that is flat stagnant and common nor is there any better foundation for mr seeley s somewhat peremptory assertion that previous writers all miss what he considers the true point in our history during the eighteenth century it is simply contrary to fact to assert that they do not perceive that in that century the history of england is not in england but in america and asia mr green for instance was not strong in his grasp of the eighteenth century and that period is in many respects an extremely unsatisfactory part of his work yet if we turn to his history of the english people this is what we find at the very outset of the section that deals with modern england the seven years war is in fact a turning point in our national history as it is a turning point in the history of the world from the close of the seven years war it mattered little whether england counted for less or more with the nations around her she was no longer a mere european power she was no longer a rival of germany or france her future action lay in a wider sphere than that of europe mistress of northern america the future mistress of india claiming as her own the empire of the seas britain suddenly towered high above nations whose position in a single continent doomed them to comparative insignificance in the after history of the world it is this that gives william pitt so unique a position among our statesmen his figure in fact stands at the opening of a new epoch in english history in the history not of england only but of the english race

suggested the puzzled wheelwright but one at a time ulrich one at a time that is a very different thing why should it not come to him alone among men surely it was a beautiful thing this love a thing worthy of a man without which a man was but a useless devourer of food cumbering the earth so ulrich pondered pausing from his work one drowsy summer s afternoon listening to the low song of the waters how well he knew the winding muhlde s merry voice he had worked beside it played beside it all his life often he would sit and talk to it as to an old friend reading answers in its changing tones trudchen seeing him idle pushed her cold nose into his hand trudchen just now was feeling clever and important was she not the mother of the five most wonderful puppies in all saxony they swarmed about his legs pressing him with their little foolish heads ulrich stooped and picked up one in each big hand but this causing jealousy and heartburning laughing he lay down upon a log then the whole five stormed over him biting his hair trampling with their clumsy paws upon his face till suddenly they raced off in a body to attack a floating feather ulrich sat up and watched them the little rogues the little foolish helpless things that called for so much care a mother thrush twittered above his head ulrich rose and creeping on tiptoe peeped into the nest but the mother bird casting one glance towards him went on with her work whoever was afraid of ulrich the wheelwright the tiny murmuring insects buzzed to and fro about his feet an old man passing to his evening rest gave him good day a zephyr whispered something to the leaves at which they laughed then passed upon his way here and there a shadow crept out from its hiding place if only i could marry the whole village laughed ulrich to himself but that of course is nonsense the spring that followed let loose the dogs of war again upon the blood stained land for now all germany taught late by common suffering forgetfulness of local rivalries was rushing together in a mighty wave that would sweep french feet for ever from their hold on german soil ulrich for whom the love of woman seemed not would at least be the lover of his country he too would march among those brave stern hearts that stealing like a thousand rivulets from every german valley were flowing north and west to join the prussian eagles but even love of country seemed denied to ulrich of the dreamy eyes his wheelwright s business had called him to a town far off he had been walking all the day towards evening passing the outskirts of a wood a feeble cry for help sounding from the shadows fell upon his ear ulrich paused and again from the sombre wood crept that weary cry of pain ulrich ran and came at last to where among the wild flowers and the grass lay prone five human figures two of them were of the german landwehr the other three frenchmen in the hated uniform of napoleon s famous scouts it had been some unimportant affair of outposts one of those common incidents of warfare that are never recorded never remembered save here and there by some sad face unnoticed in the crowd four of the men were dead one a frenchman was still alive though bleeding copiously from a deep wound in the chest that with a handful of dank grass he was trying to staunch ulrich raised him in his arms the man spoke no german and ulrich knew but his mother tongue but when the man turning towards the neighbouring village with a look of terror in his half glazed eyes pleaded with his hands ulrich understood and lifting him gently carried him further into the wood he found a small deserted shelter that had been made by charcoal burners and there on a bed of grass and leaves ulrich laid him and there for a week all but a day ulrich tended him and nursed him back to life coming and going stealthily like a thief in the darkness then ulrich who had thought his one desire in life to be to kill all frenchmen put food and drink into the frenchman s knapsack and guided him half through the night and took his hand and so they parted ulrich did not return to alt waldnitz that lies hidden in the forest beside the murmuring muhlde they would think he had gone to the war he would let them think so he was too great a coward to go back to them and tell them that he no longer wanted to fight that the sound of the drum brought to him only the thought of trampled grass where dead men lay with curses in their eyes so with head bowed down in shame to and fro about the moaning land ulrich of the dreamy eyes came and went guiding his solitary footsteps by the sounds of sorrow driving away the things of evil where they crawled among the wounded making his way swiftly to the side of pain heedless of the uniform thus one day he found himself by chance near again to forest girdled waldnitz he would push his way across the hills wander through its quiet ways in the moonlight while the good folks all lay sleeping his foot steps quickened as he drew nearer where the trees broke he would be able to look down upon it see every roof he knew so well the church the mill the winding muhlde the green worn grey with dancing feet where when the hateful war was over would be heard again the saxon folk songs another was there where the forest halts on the brow of the hill a figure kneeling on the ground with his face towards the village ulrich stole closer it was the herr pfarrer praying volubly but inaudibly he scrambled to his feet as ulrich touched him and his first astonishment over poured forth

conclusion and commencement were very near together the terror of the sight the terror of what in defence of his own life he was forced to do revolted him even in the heat of the fight and even then over that ghastly and distorted face another face spread itself like a mask blotting it out from view that woman s face and now again it re arose inspiring him with the rather recondite reflections as to the immutability of things and impressions with which this domestic record opens five years is a good stretch in a man s journey through the world many things happen to us in that time if a thoughtful person were to set to work to record all the impressions which impinge upon his mind during that period he would fill a library with volumes the mere tale of its events would furnish a shelf and yet how small they are to look back upon it seemed but the other day that he was leaning over this very gate and had turned to see a young girl dressed in black who with a spray of honeysuckle thrust in her girdle and carrying a stick in her hand was walking leisurely down the lane there was something about the girl s air that had struck him while she was yet a long way off a dignity a grace and a set of the shoulders then as she came nearer he saw the soft dark eyes and the waving brown hair that contrasted so strangely and effectively with the pale and striking features it was not a beautiful face for the mouth was too large and the nose was not as straight as it might have been but there was a power about the broad brow and a force and solid nobility stamped upon the features which had impressed him strangely just as she came opposite to where he was standing a gust of wind for there was a stiff breeze blew the lady s hat off taking it over the hedge and he as in duty bound scrambled into the field and fetched it for her and she had thanked him with a quick smile and a lighting up of the brown eyes and then passed on with a bow yes with a little bow she had passed on and he watched her walking down the long level drift till her image melted into the stormy sunset light and was gone when he returned to the cottage he had described her to his old aunt and asked who she might be to learn that she was ida de la molle which sounded like a name out of a novel the only daughter of the old squire who lived at honham castle next day he had left for india and saw miss de la molle no more and now he wondered what had become of her probably she was married so striking a person would be almost sure to attract the notice of men and after all what could it matter to him he was not a marrying man and women as a class had little attraction for him indeed he disliked them it has been said that he had never married and never even had a love affair since he was five and twenty but though he was not married he once before he was five and twenty very nearly took that step it was twenty years ago now and nobody quite knew the history for in twenty years many things are fortunately forgotten but there was a history and a scandal and the marriage was broken off almost on the day it should have taken place and after that it leaked out in the neighbourhood that the young lady who by the way was a considerable heiress had gone off her head presumably with grief and been confined in an asylum where she was believed still to remain perhaps it was the thought of this one woman s face the woman he had once seen walking down the drift her figure limned out against the stormy sky that led him to think of the other face the face hidden in the madhouse at any rate with a sigh or rather a groan he swung himself round from the gate and began to walk homeward at a brisk pace the drift that he was following is known as the mile drift and had in ancient times formed the approach to the gates of honham castle the seat of the ancient and honourable family of de la molle sometimes written delamol in history and old writings honham castle was now nothing but a ruin with a manor house built out of the wreck on one side of its square and the broad way that led to it from the high road which ran from boisingham the local country town was a drift or grass lane said to have been so named after the boissey family whose heiress a de la molle married in the fourteenth century as however the town of boisingham is mentioned by one of the old chroniclers this does not seem very probable no doubt the family took their name from the town or hamlet not the town from the family colonel quaritch followed this drift till he came to the high road and then turned a few minutes walk brought him to a drive opening out of the main road on the left as he faced towards boisingham this drive which was some three hundred yards long led up a rather sharp slope to his own place honham cottage or molehill as the villagers called it a title calculated to give a keen impression of a neat spick and span red brick villa with a slate roof in fact however it was nothing of the sort being a building of the fifteenth century as a glance at its massive flint walls was sufficient to show in ancient times there had been a large abbey at boisingham two miles away which the records tell suffered terribly from an outbreak of the plague in the fifteenth century

belongs to him but she had wondered still it s the american way that s all exactly it s all it s all i say it fits him so it must be good for something do you think it would be good for you maggie

alive so i must also cultivate it to get my pleasure he couldn t make one like him so much in any other language it mattered little that the girl had continued to demur it was the mere play of her joy

you know are the reigns without any history oh i m not afraid of history she had been sure of that call it the bad part if you like yours certainly sticks out of you what was it else maggie verver had also said that made me originally think of you it wasn t as i should suppose you must have seen what you call your unknown quantity your particular self it was the generations behind you the follies and the crimes the plunder and the waste the wicked pope the monster most of all whom so many of the volumes in your family library are all about if i ve read but two or three yet i shall give myself

while i relate some of these you will learn more of the peculiar features of the beautiful valley the second surprise the strange adventures of the king s head a good many years ago the magical monarch of mo became annoyed by the purple dragon which came down from the mountains and ate up a patch of his best chocolate caramels just as they were getting ripe so the king went out to the sword tree and picked a long sharp sword and tied it to his belt and went away to the mountains to fight the purple dragon the people all applauded him saying one to another our king is a good king he will destroy this naughty purple dragon and we shall be able to eat the caramels ourselves but the dragon was not alone naughty it was big and fierce and strong and did not want to be destroyed at all therefore the king had a terrible fight with the purple dragon and cut it with his sword in several places so that the raspberry juice which ran in its veins squirted all over the ground it is always difficult to kill dragons they are by nature thick skinned and tough as doubtless every one has heard besides you must not forget that this was a purple dragon and all scientists who have studied deeply the character of dragons say those of a purple color at the most disagreeable to fight with so all the king s cutting and slashing had no effect upon the monster other than to make him angry forgetful of the respect due to a crowned king the wicked dragon presently opening wide its jaws and bit his majesty s head clean off his body then he swallowed it of course the king realized it was useless to continue to fight after that for he could not see where the dragon was so he turned and tried to find his way back to his people but at every other step he would bump into a tree which made the naughty dragon laugh at him furthermore he could not tell in which direction he was going which is an unpleasant feeling under any circumstances at last some of the people came to see if the king had succeeded in destroying the dragon and found their monarch running around in a circle bumping into trees and rocks but not getting a step nearer home so they took his hand and led him back to the palace where every one was filled with sorrow at the sad sight of the headless king indeed his devoted subjects for the first time in their lives came as near to weeping as an inhabitant of the valley of mo can never mind said the king cheerfully i can get along very well without a head and as a matter of fact the loss has its advantages i shall not be obliged to brush my hair or clean my teeth or wash my ears so do not grieve i beg of you but be happy and joyful as you were before which showed the king had a good heart and after all a good heart is better than a head any say the people hearing him speak out of his neck for he had no mouth immediately began to laugh which in a short time led to their being as happy as ever but the queen was not contented my love she said to him i can not kiss you any more and that will break my heart thereupon the king sent word throughout the valley that any one who could procure for him a new head should wed one of the princesses the princesses were all exceedingly pretty girls and so it was not long before one man made a very nice head out of candy and brought it to the king it did not look exactly like the old head but the efface was very sweet nevertheless so the king put it on and the queen kissed it at once with much satisfaction the young man had put a pair of glass eyes in the head with which the king could see very well after he got used to them according to the royal promise the young man was now called into the palace and asked to take his pick of the princesses there were all so sweet and lady like that he had some trouble in making a choice but at last he took the biggest thinking that he would thus secure the greatest reward and they were married amid great rejoicing but a few days afterward the king was caught out in a rainstorm and before he could get home his new head had melted in the great shower of lemonade that fell only the glass eyes were left and these he put in his pocket and went sorrowfully to tell the queen of his new misfortune then another young man who wanted to marry a princess made the king a head out of dough sticking in it the glass eyes and the king tried it on and found that it fitted very well so the young man was given the next biggest princess but the following day the sun chance to shine extremely hot and when the king walked out it baked his dough head into bread at which the monarch felt very light headed and when the birds saw the bread they flew down from the trees perched upon the king s shoulder and quickly ate up his new head all but the glass eyes again the good king was forced to go home to the queen without a head and the lady firmly declared that this time her husband must have a head warranted to last at least as long as the honeymoon of the young man who made it which was not at all unreasonable under the circumstances so a request was sent to all loyal subjects throughout the valley asking them to find a head for thei

bloodshed with a maximum of preservation of whatever has value in our existing civilization is a difficult problem it is this problem which has chiefly occupied my mind in writing the following pages i wish i could think that its solution would be facilitated by some slight degree of moderation and humane feeling on the part of those who enjoy unjust privileges in the world as it is the present work is the outcome of a visit to russia supplemented by much reading and discussion both before and after i have thought it best to record what i saw separately from theoretical considerations and i have endeavoured to state my impressions without any bias for or against the bolsheviks i received at their hands the greatest kindness and courtesy and i owe them a debt of gratitude for the perfect freedom which they allowed me in my investigations i am conscious that i was too short a time in russia to be able to form really reliable judgments however i share this drawback with most other westerners who have written on russia since the october revolution i feel that bolshevism is a matter of such importance that it is necessary for almost every political question to define one s attitude in regard to it and i have hopes that i may help others to define their attitude even if only by way of opposition to what i have written i have received invaluable assistance from my

part i the present condition of russia i what is hoped from bolshevism to understand bolshevism it is not sufficient to know facts it is necessary also to enter with sympathy or imagination into a new spirit the chief thing that the bolsheviks have done is to create a hope or at any rate to make strong and widespread a hope which was formerly confined to a few this aspect of the movement is as easy to grasp at a distance as it is in russia perhaps even easier because in russia present circumstances tend to obscure the view of the distant future but the actual situation in russia can only be understood superficially if we forget the hope which is the motive power of the whole one might as well describe the thebaid without mentioning that the hermits expected eternal bliss as the reward of their sacrifices here on earth i cannot share the hopes of the bolsheviks any more than those of the egyptian anchorites i regard both as tragic delusions destined to bring upon the world centuries of darkness and futile violence the principles of the sermon on the mount are admirable but their effect upon average human nature was very different from what was intended those who followed christ did not learn to love their enemies or to turn the other cheek they learned instead to use the inquisition and the stake to subject the human intellect to the yoke of an ignorant and intolerant priesthood to degrade art and extinguish science for a thousand years these were the inevitable results not of the teaching but of fanatical belief in the teaching the hopes which inspire communism are in the main as admirable as those instilled by the sermon on the mount but they are held as fanatically and are likely to do as much harm cruelty lurks in our instincts and fanaticism is a camouflage for cruelty fanatics are seldom genuinely humane and those who sincerely dread cruelty will be slow to adopt a fanatical creed i do not know whether bolshevism can be prevented from acquiring universal power but even if it cannot i am persuaded that those who stand out against it not from love of ancient injustice but in the name of the free spirit of man will be the bearers of the seeds of progress from which when the world s gestation is accomplished new life will be born the war has left throughout europe a mood of disillusionment and despair which calls aloud for a new religion as the only force capable of giving men the energy to live vigorously bolshevism has supplied the new religion it promises glorious things an end of the injustice of rich and poor an end of economic slavery an end of war it promises an end of the disunion of classes which poisons political life and threatens our industrial system with destruction it promises an end to commercialism that subtle falsehood that leads men to appraise everything by its money value and to determine money value often merely by the caprices of idle plutocrats it promises a world where all men and women shall be kept sane by work and where

father s house he sat down in the sun he stretched out his hand upon the rock beside him it felt warm that was the island s personal temperature when in its afternoon sleep as now he listened and heard sounds whirr whirr saw saw saw those were the island s snores the noises of the quarrymen and stone sawyers opposite to the spot on which he sat was a roomy cottage or homestead like the island it was all of stone not only in walls but in window frames roof chimneys fence stile pigsty and stable almost door he remembered who had used to live there and probably lived there now the caro family the roan mare caros as they were called to distinguish them from other branches of the same pedigree there being but half a dozen christian and surnames in the whole island he crossed the road and

leading from the back rooms was thrown open and a young girl about seventeen or eighteen came bounding in why tis dear joce she burst out joyfully and running up to the young man she kissed him the demonstration was sweet enough from the owner of such an affectionate pair of bright hazel eyes and brown tresses of hair but it was so sudden so unexpected by a man fresh from towns that he winced for a moment quite involuntarily and there was some constraint in the manner in which he returned her kiss and said my pretty little avice how do you do after so long for a few seconds her impulsive innocence hardly noticed his start of surprise but mrs caro the girl s mother had observed it instantly with a pained flush she turned to her daughter avice my dear avice why what are you doing don t you know that you ve grown up to be a woman since jocelyn mr pierston was last down here of course you mustn t do now as you used to do three or four years ago the awkwardness which had arisen was hardly removed by pierston s assurance that he quite expected her to keep up the practice of her childhood followed by several minutes of conversation on general subjects he was vexed from his soul that his unaware movement should so have betrayed him at his leaving he repeated that if avice regarded him otherwise than as she used to do he would never forgive her but though they parted good

into the back garden like all the gardens in the isle it was surrounded by a wall of dry jointed spawls and at its further extremity it ran out into a corner which adjoined the garden of the caros he had no sooner reached this spot than he became aware of a murmuring and sobbing on the other side of the wall the voice he recognized in a moment as avice s and she seemed to be confiding her trouble to some young friend of her own sex oh what shall i do what shall i do she was saying bitterly so bold as it was so shameless how could i think of such a thing he will never forgive me never never

preached with unparalleled luminosity and completeness the theory that true progress goes on so steadily through human history that while reaction is indefensible revolution is unnecessary thackeray seems to have been quite content to think that the world would grow more and more liberal in the limited sense that free trade would get freer that ballot boxes would grow more and more secret that at last as some satirist of liberalism puts it every man would have two votes instead of one there is no trace in thackeray of the slightest consciousness that progress could ever change its direction there is in dickens the whole of hard times is the expression of just such a realisation it is not true to say that dickens was a socialist but it is not absurd to say so and it would be simply absurd to say it of any of the great individualist novelists of the victorian time dickens saw far enough ahead to know that the time was coming when the people would be imploring the state to save them from mere freedom as from some frightful foreign oppressor he felt the society changing and thackeray never did as talking about socialism and individualism is one of the greatest bores ever endured among men i will take another instance to illustrate my meaning even though the instance be a queer and even a delicate one even if the reader does not agree with my deduction i ask his attention to the fact itself which i think a curiosity of literature in the last important work of dickens that excellent book our mutual friend there is an odd thing about which i cannot make up my mind i do not know whether it is unconscious observation or fiendish irony but it is this in our mutual friend is an old patriarch named aaron who is a saintly jew made to do the dirty work of an abominable christian usurer in an artistic sense i think the patriarch aaron as much of a humbug as the patriarch casby in a moral sense there is no doubt at all that dickens introduced the jew with a philanthropic idea of doing justice to judaism which he was told he had affronted by the great gargoyle of fagin if this was his motive it was morally a most worthy one but it is certainly unfortunate for the hebrew cause that the bad jew should be so very much more convincing than the good one old aaron is not an exaggeration of jewish virtues he is simply not jewish because he is not human there is nothing about him that in any way suggests the nobler sort of jew such a man as spinoza or mr zangwill he is simply a public apology and like most public apologies he is very stiff and not very convincing so far so good now we come to the funny part to describe the high visionary and mystic jew like spinoza or zangwill is a great and delicate task in which even dickens might have failed but most of us know something of the make and manners of the low jew who is generally the successful one most of us know the jew who calls himself de valancourt now to any one who knows a low jew by sight or hearing the story called our mutual friend is literally full of jews like all dickens s best characters they are vivid we know them and we know them to be hebrew mr veneering the man from nowhere dark sphinx like smiling with black curling hair and a taste in florid vulgar furniture of what stock was he mr lammle with too much nose in his face too much ginger in his whiskers too much sparkle in his studs and manners of what blood was he mr lammle s friends coarse and thick lipped with fingers so covered with rings that they could hardly hold their gold pencils do they remind us of anybody mr fledgeby with his little ugly eyes and social flashiness and craven bodily servility might not some fanatic like m drumont make interesting conjectures about him the particular types that people hate in jewry the types that are the shame of all good jews absolutely run riot in this book which is supposed to contain an apology to them it looks at first sight as if dickens s apology were one hideous sneer it looks as if he put in one good jew whom nobody could believe in and then balanced him with ten bad jews whom nobody could fail to recognise it seems as if he had avenged himself for the doubt about fagin by introducing five or six fagins triumphant fagins fashionable fagins fagins who had changed their names the impeccable old aaron stands up in the middle of this ironic carnival with a peculiar solemnity and silliness he looks like one particularly stupid englishman pretending to be a jew amidst all that crowd of clever jews who are pretending to be englishmen but this notion of a sneer is not admissible dickens was far too frank and generous a writer to employ such an elaborate plot of silence his satire was always intended to attack never to entrap moreover he was far too vain a man not to wish the crowd to see all his jokes vanity is more divine than pride because it is more democratic than pride third and most important dickens was a good liberal and would have been horrified at the notion of making so venomous a vendetta against one race or creed nevertheless the fact is there as i say if only as a curiosity of literature i defy any man to read through our mutual friend after hearing this suggestion and to get out of his head the conviction that lammle is the wrong kind of jew the explanation lies i think in this that dickens was so wonderfully sensitive to that change that has come over our society that he noticed the type of the oriental and cosmopolitan financier without even knowing that it was oriental or cosmopolitan he had in fact fallen a victim to a very simple fallacy affecting this problem somebody said with great wit and truth that treason cannot prosper because when it prospers it cannot be called treason the same argument soothed

careers were at stake and then it was that dr winter whom we had asked out of courtesy to be present introduced into the wound a finger which seemed to our excited senses to be about nine inches long and hooked out the stone at the end of it it s always well to bring one in your waistcoat pocket said he with a chuckle but i suppose you youngsters are above all that we made him president of our branch of the british medical association but he resigned after the first meeting the young men are too much for me he said i don t understand what they are talking about yet his patients do very well he has the healing touch that magnetic thing which defies explanation or analysis but which is a very evident fact none the less his mere presence leaves the patient with more hopefulness and vitality the sight of disease affects him as dust does a careful housewife it makes him angry and impatient tut tut this will never do he cries as he takes over a new case he would shoo death out of the room as though he were an intrusive hen but when the intruder refuses to be dislodged when the blood moves more slowly and the eyes grow dimmer then it is that dr winter is of more avail than all the drugs in his surgery dying folk cling to his hand as if the presence of his bulk and vigour gives them more courage to face the change and that kindly windbeaten face has been the last earthly impression which many a sufferer has carried into the unknown when dr patterson and i both of us young energetic and up to date settled in the district we were most cordially received by the old doctor who would have been only too happy to be relieved of some of his patients the patients themselves however followed their own inclinations which is a reprehensible way that patients have so that we remained neglected with our modern instruments and our latest alkaloids while he was serving out senna and calomel to all the countryside we both of us loved the old fellow but at the same time in the privacy of our own intimate conversations we could not help commenting upon this deplorable lack of judgment it s all very well for the poorer people said patterson but after all the educated classes have a right to expect that their medical man will know the difference between a mitral murmur and a bronchitic rale it s the judicial frame of mind not the sympathetic which is the essential one i thoroughly agreed with patterson in what he said it happened however that very shortly afterwards the epidemic of influenza broke out and we were all worked to death one morning i met patterson on my

pains in every joint as evening closed in i could no longer disguise the fact that the scourge was upon me and i felt that i should have medical advice without delay it was of patterson naturally that i thought but somehow the idea of him had suddenly become repugnant to me i thought of his cold critical attitude of his endless questions of his tests and his tappings i wanted something more

her glance while i read in that of the young lady coming after and showing her beauty first over this shoulder and then over that of her mother chiefly a present amusement behind which lay a character of perhaps equal pride if not equal hardness she was very beautiful in the dark style which i cannot help thinking has fallen into unmerited abeyance and as she passed us i could see that she was very graceful she was dressed in a lady s acceptance of the fashions of that day which would be thought so grotesque in this i have heard contemporaneous young girls laugh at the mere notion of hoops but in we thought hoops extremely becoming and this young lady knew how to hold hers a little on one side so as to give herself room in the narrow avenue and not betray more than the discreetest hint of a white stocking i believe the stockings are black now they both got by us and i could see mr glendenning following them with longing but irresolute eyes until they turned a long way down the saloon as if to come toward us again then he hurried to meet them and as he addressed himself first to one and then to the other i knew him to be offering them his chair so did my wife and she said you must give up your place too basil and i said i would if she wished to see me starve on the spot but of course i went and joined glendenning in his entreaties that they would deprive us of our chances of dinner i knew what the second table was on the corinthian and i must say that the elder lady accepted my chair in the spirit which my secret grudge deserved she made me feel as if i ought to have offered it when they first passed us but it was some satisfaction to learn afterwards that she gave mrs march for her ready sacrifice of me as bad a half hour as she ever had she sat next to my wife and the young lady took glendenning s place and as soon as we had left them she began trying to find out from mrs march who he was and what his relation to us was the girl tried to check her at first and then seemed to give it up and devoted herself to being rather more amiable than she otherwise might have been my wife thought in compensation for the severity of her mother s scrutiny her mother appeared disposed to hold mrs march responsible for knowing little or nothing about mr glendenning he seems to be an episcopal clergyman she said in a haughty summing up from his name i should have supposed he was scotch and a presbyterian she began to patronize the trip we were making and to abuse it she said that she did not see what could have induced them to undertake it but one had to get back from niagara somehow and they had been told at the hotel there that the boats were very comfortable she had never been more uncomfortable in her life as for the rapids they made her ill and they were obviously so dangerous that she should not even look at them again then from having done all the talking and most of the eating she fell quite silent and gave her daughter a chance to speak to my wife she had hitherto spoken only to her mother but now she asked mrs march if she had ever been down the st lawrence before when my wife explained and asked her whether she was enjoying it she answered with a rapture that was quite astonishing in reference to her mother s expressions of disgust oh immensely every instant of it and she went on to expatiate on its peculiar charm in terms so intelligent and sympathetic that mrs march confessed it had been part of our wedding journey and that this was the reason why we were now taking the trip the young lady did not seem to care so much for this and when she thanked my wife in leaving the table with her mother and begged her to thank the gentlemen who had so kindly given up their places she made no overture to further acquaintance in fact we had been so simply and merely made use of that although we were rather meek people we decided to avoid our beneficiaries for the rest of the day and mr glendenning who could not as a clergyman indulge even a just resentment could as little refuse us his sympathy he laughed at some hints of my wife s experience which she dropped before she left us to pick up a meal from the lukewarm leavings of the corinthian s dinner if we could she said she was going forward to get a good place on the bow and would keep two camp stools for us which she could assure us no one would get away from her we were somewhat surprised then to find her seated by the rail with the younger lady of the two whom she meant to avoid if she meant anything by what she said she was laughing and talking on quite easy terms with her apparently and there she triumphed as we came up i ve kept your camp stools for you and she showed them at her side where she was holding her hand on them you had better put them here the girl had stiffened a little at our approach as i could see but a young girl s stiffness is always rather amusing than otherwise and i did not mind it neither that i could see did mr glendenning and it soon passed it seemed that she had left her mother lying down in her state room where she justly imagined that if she did not see the rapids she should suffer less alarm from them the young lady had come frankly to the side of mrs march as soon as she saw her and asked if she might sit with her she now talked to me for a decent space of time and then presently without my knowing how she was talking to mr glendenning and they were comparing notes of niagara he was saying that he thought he had seen her at the cataract house and she was owning that she and her mother had at least stopped at that hotel iii i have no wish and if i had the wish i should not have the art to keep back the fact that these young people were evidently very much taken

taking part in some set ceremony they kneeled down in lines upon the snow naked from the waist up executioners with great swords appeared they advanced upon the kneeling lines without haste without wrath and letting fall the heavy swords upon the patient outstretched necks did their grim office till all were dead then they turned to find her of the flowers who had danced before and her of the

chapter i the trysting place on the very day when murgh the messenger sailed forth into that uttermost sea a young man and a maiden met together at the blythburgh marshes near to dunwich on the eastern coast of england in this the month of february of the year hard and bitter frost held suffolk in its grip the muddy stream of blyth it is true was frozen only in places since the tide flowing up from the southwold harbour where it runs into the sea between that ancient town and the hamlet of walberswick had broken up the ice but all else was set hard and fast and now toward sunset the cold was bitter stark and naked stood the tall dry reeds the blackbirds and starlings perched upon the willows seemed swollen into feathery balls the fur started on the backs of hares and a four horse wain could travel in safety over swamps where at any other time a schoolboy dared not set his foot on such an eve with snow threatening the great marsh was utterly desolate and this was why these two had chosen it for their meeting place to look on they were a goodly pair the girl who was clothed in the red she always wore tall dark well shaped with large black eyes and a determined face one who would make a very stately woman the man broad shouldered with grey eyes that were quick and almost fierce long limbed hard agile and healthy one who had never known sickness who looked as though the world were his own to master he was young but three and twenty that day and his simple dress a tunic of thick wool fastened round him with a leathern belt to which hung a short sword showed that his degree was modest the girl although she seemed his elder in fact was only in her twentieth year yet from her who had been reared in the hard school of that cruel age childhood had long departed leaving her a ripened woman before her time this pair stood looking at each other well cousin eve clavering said the man in his clear voice why did your message bid me meet you in this cold place because i had a word to say to you cousin hugh de cressi she answered boldly and the marsh being so cold and so lonesome i thought it suited to my purpose does grey dick watch yonder ay behind those willows arrow on

manors and land counting our acres by the thousand but yet poor lacking your gold though yonder manor and she pointed to some towers which rose far away above the trees upon the high land has many

jacket with a high black linen lined collar turned up about his neck the thick black hair escaping as it could below and between the cross bandages projected in curious tails and horns giving him the strangest appearance conceivable this muffled and bandaged head was so unlike what she had anticipated that for a moment she was rigid he did not remove the serviette but remained holding it as she saw now with a brown gloved hand and regarding her with his inscrutable blue glasses leave the hat he said speaking very distinctly through the white cloth her nerves began to recover from the shock they had received she placed the hat on the chair again by the fire i didn t know sir she began that and she stopped embarrassed thank you he said drily glancing from her to the door and then at her again i ll have them nicely dried sir at once she said and carried his clothes out of the room she glanced at his white swathed head and blue goggles again as she was going out of the door but his napkin was still in front of his face she shivered a little as she closed the door behind her and her face was eloquent of her surprise and perplexity i never she whispered there she went quite softly to the kitchen and was too preoccupied to ask millie what she was messing about with now when she got there the visitor sat and listened to her retreating feet he glanced inquiringly at the window before he removed his serviette and resumed his meal he took a mouthful glanced suspiciously at the window took another mouthful then rose and taking the serviette in his hand walked across the room and pulled the blind down to the top of the white muslin that obscured the lower panes this left the room in a twilight this done he returned with an easier air to the table and his meal the poor soul s had an accident or an op ration or somethin said mrs hall what a turn them bandages did give me to be sure she put on some more coal unfolded the clothes horse and extended the traveller s coat upon this and they goggles why he looked more like a divin helmet than a human man she hung his muffler on a corner of the horse and holding that handkerchief over his mouth all the time talkin through it perhaps his mouth was hurt too maybe she turned round as one who suddenly remembers bless my soul alive she said going off at a tangent ain t you done them taters yet millie when mrs hall went to clear away the stranger s lunch her idea that his mouth must also have been cut or disfigured in the accident she supposed him to have suffered was confirmed for he was smoking a pipe and all the time that she was in the room he never loosened the silk muffler he had wrapped round the lower part of his face to put the mouthpiece to his lips yet it was not forgetfulness for she saw he glanced at it as it smouldered out he sat in the corner with his back to the window blind and spoke now having eaten and drunk and being comfortably warmed through with less aggressive brevity than before the reflection of the fire lent a kind of red animation to his big spectacles they had lacked hitherto i have some luggage he said at bramblehurst station and he asked her how he could have it sent he bowed his bandaged head quite politely in acknowledgment of her explanation to morrow he said there is no speedier delivery and seemed quite disappointed when she answered no was she quite sure no man with a trap who would go over mrs hall nothing loath answered his questions and developed a conversation it s a steep road by the down sir she said in answer to the question about a trap and then snatching at an opening said it was there a carriage was upsettled a year ago and more a gentleman killed besides his coachman accidents sir happen in a moment don t they but the visitor was not to be

sir and no laughing matter to them as had the doing for him as i had my sister being took up with her little ones so much there was bandages to do sir and bandages to undo so that if i may make so bold as to say it sir will you get me some matches said the visitor quite abruptly my pipe is out mrs hall was pulled up suddenly it was certainly rude of him after telling him all she had done she gasped at him for a moment and remembered the two sovereigns she went for the matches thanks he said concisely as she put them down and turned his shoulder upon her and stared out of the window again it was altogether too discouraging evidently he was sensitive on the topic of operations and bandages she did not make so bold as to say however after all but his snubbing way had irritated her and millie had a hot time of it that afternoon the visitor remained in the parlour until four o clock without giving the ghost of an excuse for an intrusion for the most part he was quite still during

for deciding between the various principles when they conflict ought to be self evident to inquire how far the bad effects of this deficiency have been mitigated in practice or to what extent the moral beliefs of mankind have been vitiated or made uncertain by the absence of any distinct recognition of an ultimate standard would imply a complete survey and criticism of past and present ethical doctrine it would however be easy to show that whatever steadiness or consistency these moral beliefs have attained has been mainly due to the tacit influence of a standard not recognised although the non existence of an acknowledged first principle has made ethics not so much a guide as a consecration of men s actual sentiments still as men s sentiments both of favour and of aversion are greatly influenced by what they suppose to be the effects of things upon their happiness the principle of utility or as bentham latterly called it the greatest happiness principle has had a large share in forming the moral doctrines even of those who most scornfully reject its authority nor is there any school of thought which refuses to admit that the influence of actions on happiness is a most material and even predominant consideration in many of the details of morals however unwilling to acknowledge it as the fundamental principle of morality and the source of moral obligation i might go much further and say that to all those xa priori moralists who deem it necessary to argue at all utilitarian arguments are indispensable it is not my present purpose to criticise these thinkers but i cannot help referring for illustration to a systematic treatise by one of the most illustrious of them the metaphysics of ethics by kant this remarkable man whose system of thought will long remain one of the landmarks in the history of philosophical speculation does in the treatise in question lay down an universal first principle as the origin and ground of moral obligation it is this so act that the rule on which thou actest would admit of being adopted as a law by all rational beings but when he begins to deduce from this precept any of the actual duties of morality he fails almost grotesquely to show that there would be any contradiction any logical not to say physical impossibility in the adoption by all rational beings of the most outrageously immoral rules of conduct all he shows is that the consequences of their universal adoption would be such as no one would choose to incur on the present occasion i shall without further discussion of the other theories attempt to contribute something towards the understanding and appreciation of the utilitarian or happiness theory and towards such proof as it is susceptible of it is evident that this cannot be proof in the ordinary and popular meaning of the term questions of ultimate ends are not amenable to direct proof whatever can be proved to be good must be so by being shown to be a means to something admitted to be good without proof the medical art is proved to be good by its conducing to health but how is it possible to prove that health is good the art of music is good for the reason among others that it produces pleasure but what proof is it possible to give that pleasure is good if then it is asserted that there is a comprehensive formula including all things which are in themselves good and that whatever else is good is not so as an end but as a mean the formula may be accepted or rejected but is not a subject of what is commonly understood by proof we are not however to infer that its acceptance or rejection must depend on blind impulse or arbitrary choice there is a larger meaning of the word proof in which this question is as amenable to it as any other of the disputed questions of philosophy the subject is within the cognizance of the rational faculty and neither does that faculty deal with it solely in the way of intuition considerations may be presented capable of determining the intellect either to give or withhold its assent to the doctrine and this is equivalent to proof we shall examine presently of what nature are these considerations in what manner they apply to the case and what rational grounds therefore can be given for accepting or rejecting the utilitarian formula but it is a preliminary condition of rational acceptance or rejection that the formula should be correctly understood i believe that the very imperfect notion ordinarily formed of its meaning is the chief obstacle which impedes its reception and that could it be cleared even from only the grosser misconceptions the question would be greatly simplified and a large proportion of its difficulties removed before therefore i attempt to enter into the philosophical grounds which can be given for assenting to the utilitarian standard i shall offer some illustrations of the doctrine itself with the view of showing more clearly what it is distinguishing it from what it is not and disposing of such of the practical objections to it as either originate in or are closely connected with mistaken interpretations of its meaning having thus prepared the ground i shall afterwards endeavour to throw such light as i can upon the question considered as one of philosophical theory chapter ii what utilitarianism is a passing remark is all that needs be given to the ignorant blunder of supposing that those who stand up for utility as the test of right and wrong use the term in that restricted and merely colloquial sense in which utility is opposed to pleasure an apology is due to the philosophical opponents of utilitarianism for even the momentary appearance of confounding them with any one capable of so absurd a misconception which is the more extraordinary

one of them that on the projection at the eastern extremity of the piazzetta de leoni is of far finer and probably earlier workmanship than all the rest the southern range of pinnacles is again inferior to the northern and western and visibly of later date then the screen which most writers have described as part of the original fabric bears its date inscribed on its architrave and with it are associated a multitude of small screens balustrades decorations of the interior building and probably the rose window of the south transept then come the interpolated traceries of the front and sides then the crocketings of the upper arches extravagances of the incipient renaissance and finally the figures which carry the waterspouts on the north side utterly barbarous seventeenth or eighteenth century work connect the whole with the plastered restorations of the year and most of the palaces in venice have sustained interpolations hardly less numerous and those of the ducal palace are so intricate that a year s labor would probably be insufficient altogether to disentangle and define them i therefore gave up all thoughts of obtaining a perfectly clear chronological view of the early architecture but the dates necessary to the main purposes of the book the reader will find well established and of the evidence brought forward for those of less importance he is himself to judge doubtful estimates are never made grounds of argument and the accuracy of the account of the buildings themselves for which alone i pledge myself is of course entirely independent of them in like manner as the statements briefly made in the chapters on construction involve questions so difficult and so general that i cannot hope that every expression referring to them will be found free from error and as the conclusions to which i have endeavored to lead the reader are thrown into a form the validity of which depends on that of each successive step it might be argued if fallacy or weakness could be detected in one of them that all the subsequent reasonings were valueless the reader may be assured however that it is not so the method of proof used in the following essay being only one out of many which were in my choice adopted because it seemed to me the shortest and simplest not as being the strongest in many cases the conclusions are those which men of quick feeling would arrive at instinctively and i then sought to discover the reasons of what so strongly recommended itself as truth though these reasons could every one of them from the beginning to the end of the book be proved insufficient the truth of its conclusions would remain the same i should only regret that i had dishonored them by an ill grounded defence and endeavor to repair my error by a better one i have not however written carelessly nor should i in any wise have expressed doubt of the security of the following argument but that it is physically impossible for me being engaged quite as much with mountains and clouds and trees and criticism of painting as with architecture to verify as i should desire the expression of every sentence bearing upon empirical and technical matters life is not long enough nor does a day pass by without causing me to feel more bitterly the impossibility of carrying out to the extent which i should desire the separate studies which general criticism continually forces me to undertake i can only assure the reader that he will find the certainty of every statement i permit myself to make increase with its importance and that for the security of the final conclusions of the following essay as well as for the resolute veracity of its account of whatever facts have come under my own immediate cognizance i will pledge myself to the uttermost it was necessary to the accomplishment of the purpose of the work of which account is given in the first chapter that i should establish some canons of judgment which the general reader should thoroughly understand and if it pleased him accept before we took cognizance together of any architecture whatsoever it has taken me more time and trouble to do this than i expected but if i have succeeded the thing done will be of use for many other purposes than that to which it is now put the establishment of these canons which i have called the foundations and some account of the connection of venetian architecture with that of the rest of europe have filled the present volume the second will i hope contain all i have to say about venice itself it was of course inexpedient to reduce drawings of crowded details to the size of an octavo volume i do not say impossible but inexpedient requiring infinite pains on the part of the engraver with no result except farther pains to the beholder and as on the other hand folio books are not easy reading i determined to separate the text and the unreducible plates i have given with the principal text all the illustrations absolutely necessary to the understanding of it and in the detached work such additional text as has special reference to the larger illustrations a considerable number of these larger plates were at first intended to be executed in tinted lithography but finding the result unsatisfactory i have determined to prepare the principal subjects for mezzotinting a change of method requiring two new drawings to be made of every subject one a carefully penned outline for the etcher and then a finished drawing upon the etching this work does not proceed fast while i am also occupied with the completion of the text but the numbers of it will appear as fast as i can prepare them for the illustrations of the body of the work itself i have used any kind of engraving which seemed suited to the

old door down and bab twisted round to give it a thump with her boots you needn t laugh you know you d like it as much as me she added twisting back again rather ashamed of her impatience i didn t

do i ll eat up the cake no you won t it s mine ma said so and you are only company so you d better behave or i won t have any party at all so now this awful threat calmed bab s anger at once and she hastened to introduce a safer subject never mind don t let s fight before the children do you know ma says she will let us play in the coach house next time it rains and keep the key if we want to oh goody that s because we told her how we found the little window under the woodbine and didn t try to go in though we might have just as easy as not cried betty appeased at once for after a ten years acquaintance she had grown used to bab s peppery temper i suppose the coach will be all dust and rats and spiders but i don t care you and the dolls can be the passengers and i shall sit up in front

guess we d better go and get the water now suggested bab feeling that it was not safe to encourage her sister in such complaints it is not many people who would dare to leave their children all alone with such a lovely cake and know they wouldn t pick at it said betty proudly as they trotted away to the spring each with a little tin pail in her hand alas for the faith of these too confiding mammas they were gone about five minutes and when they returned a sight met their astonished eyes which produced a simultaneous shriek of horror flat upon their faces lay the fourteen dolls and the cake the cherished cake was gone for an instant the little girls could only stand motionless gazing at the dreadful scene then bab cast her water pail wildly away and doubling up her fist cried out fiercely it

foul mass of decay ay said grace i thought of your dahlias that what with the rain and the frost were pah the nastiest mess at last then he said proceeded jessie that there were some fair and comely some not but only bringing forth just their own seeds not doing any real good like people that keep themselves to themselves and think it is enough to be out of mischief and do good to themselves and their families and didn t you like it broke in amy when he said that was not what god asked of us he wanted us to be like the wheat or the vine or the apple or the strawberry some plain in blossom some fair and lovely to look at but valued for the fruit they bring forth not selfishly just to keep up their own stock but for the support and joy and blessing of all one s heart just burnt within one continued jessie when he bade us each one to go home and think what we could do to bring forth fruit for the master some thirty some sixty some an hundredfold not only just keeping oneself straight but doing something for christ through his members only think of its being for christ himself said amy softly well said grace i thought we might take turns to go to miss manners s missionary working parties i never gave in to them before but i shall not be comfortable now unless i do something and was that what you meant about the velvet trimming jessie it will save fifteen pence said jessie very well or you may say threepence more so we can put that into the box if you like i must be going now and look sharp if i m to catch the bus so good bye all of you oh but won t you have the self trimming broke in florence perhaps she ll be there on friday night and then we might amongst us make out how it is done florence cray for shame said grace i do believe you minded nothing but that dress all through that sermon well said florence who was a good humoured girl there was no helping it when there it was just opposite in the aisle and i d never seen one like it and as to the sermon you ve just given it to me over again you ve got it so pat and i ll go to the missionary work meeting too grace and very like the young lady will be there and i can see her trimming if you go for that i would go to a fashion book at once said grace but i must really be off now i ve not another minute to stop oh dear i forgot cried florence jumping up i was to ask you to call for our best tea pot at bilson s and my mother wants a dozen and there her voice was lost as she followed grace out of the room through the shop and even along the road discoursing on her commissions amy and jessie were left together and amy stood up and said dear i am so glad you felt it as i did one could not help it if one listened at all said jessie amy i must be doing something for his sake i can t rest now without it you teach at the sunday school don t you think i might amy meditated a little i think they would make up a class for you when miss pemberton s niece goes away the class she takes has to be joined to her aunt s and that makes a large one then will you speak to miss manners for me asked jessie are they little girls or big ones oh that s the second class they would be sure not to give you that said amy as if she thought the aspiration very high not to say presumptuous perhaps margaret roller the pupil teacher you know may take that then i should have hers and you mine they are dear little girls some of them only susan bray always wants a tight hand over her polly smithers is so stupid and fanny morris is so sly one always has to be on the watch here she comes said florence who was the nearest to the window and the entrance of aunt rose a brisk fair little woman young looking for her age recalled all her young ladies as florence and jessie and perhaps amy likewise preferred being called to recollect that stitching was at that moment at least the first thing to be attended to chapter ii the sunday school perhaps amy s business like tone about the school classes fell a little flat upon jessie s ear she had not been to a sunday school in her childhood her father had been a prosperous upholsterer s foreman in minsterham and grace and jessie had gone to an academy till when they were sixteen and fourteen years old their father died of a fever and their mother who had a cottage of her own at langley resolved on coming back and setting up a small shop there for all sorts of wares with clementina hollis over the door jessie was about eighteen two years younger than her sister she had always been a bright quick lively girl but never very thoughtful and much too inquisitive till her curiosity had brought on her a terrible accident which had kept her laid up in a hospital for many weeks she had come home quite well at last and much improved a fellow patient and likewise a lady who had visited her and lent her books had both made much impression on her she cared about right and wrong as she had never done before was more useful at home and tried to restrain her inclination to find out all about everything she said her prayers more carefully went to church more often and heeded more what she heard and altogether she was what her mother called an

the moon than i have i will never believe in you again i am sure gladys there is nothing of the kind in my hand said the duchess gravely your grace is quite right said mr podgers glancing at the little fat hand with its short square fingers the mountain of the moon is not developed the line of life however is excellent kindly bend the wrist thank you three distinct lines on the rascette you will live to a great age duchess and be extremely happy ambition very moderate line of intellect not exaggerated line of heart now do be indiscreet mr podgers cried lady windermere nothing would give me greater pleasure said mr podgers bowing if the duchess ever had been but i am sorry to say that i see great permanence of affection combined with a strong sense of duty pray go on mr podgers said the duchess looking quite pleased economy is not the least of your grace s virtues continued mr podgers and lady windermere went off into fits of laughter economy is a very good thing remarked the duchess complacently when i married paisley he had eleven castles and not a single house fit to live in and now he has twelve houses and not a single castle cried lady windermere well my dear said the duchess i like comfort said mr podgers and modern improvements and hot water laid on in every bedroom your grace is quite right comfort is the only thing our civilisation can give us you have told the duchess s character admirably mr podgers and now you must tell lady flora s and in answer to a nod from the smiling hostess a tall girl with sandy scotch hair and high shoulder blades stepped awkwardly from behind the sofa and held out a long bony hand with spatulate fingers ah a pianist i see said mr podgers an excellent pianist but perhaps hardly a musician very reserved very honest and with a great love of animals quite true exclaimed the duchess turning to lady windermere absolutely true flora keeps two dozen collie dogs at macloskie and would turn our town house into a menagerie if her father would let her well that is just what i do with my house every thursday evening cried lady windermere laughing only i like lions better than collie dogs your one mistake lady windermere said mr podgers with a pompous bow if a woman can t make her mistakes charming she is only a female was the answer but you must read some more hands for us come sir thomas show mr podgers yours and a genial looking old gentleman in a white waistcoat came forward and held out a thick rugged hand with a very long third finger an adventurous nature four long voyages in the past and one to come been ship wrecked three times no only twice but in danger of a shipwreck your next journey a strong conservative very punctual and with a passion for collecting curiosities had a severe illness between the ages sixteen and eighteen was left a fortune when about thirty great aversion to cats and radicals extraordinary exclaimed sir thomas you must really tell my wife s hand too your second wife s said mr podgers quietly still keeping sir thomas s hand in his your second wife s i shall be charmed but lady marvel a melancholy looking woman with brown hair and sentimental eyelashes entirely declined to have her past or her future exposed and nothing that lady windermere could do would induce monsieur de koloff the russian ambassador even to take his gloves off in fact many people seemed afraid to face the odd little man with his stereotyped smile his gold spectacles and his bright beady eyes and when he told poor lady fermor right out before every one that she did not care a bit for music but was extremely fond of musicians it was generally felt that cheiromancy was a most dangerous science and one that ought not to be encouraged except in a tete a tete lord arthur savile however who did not know anything about lady fermor s unfortunate story and who had been watching mr podgers with a great deal of interest was filled with an immense curiosity to have his own hand read and feeling somewhat shy about putting himself forward crossed over the room to where lady windermere was sitting and with a charming blush asked her if she thought mr podgers would mind of course he won t mind said lady windermere that is what he is here for all my lions lord arthur are performing lions and jump through hoops whenever i ask them but i must warn you beforehand that i shall tell sybil everything she is coming to lunch with me to morrow to talk about bonnets and if mr podgers finds out that you have a bad temper or a tendency to gout or a wife living in bayswater i shall certainly let her know all about it lord arthur smiled and shook his head i am not afraid he answered sybil knows me as well as i know her ah i am a little sorry to hear you say that the proper basis for marriage is a mutual misunderstanding no i am not at all cynical i have merely got experience which however is very much the same thing mr podgers lord arthur savile is dying to have his hand read don

serious matter or might have been if squire owl hadn t interfered down at the pond lives an old fellow by the name of slowly turtle and between you and me i don t think he has very much sense although you can t really say he is foolish i suppose it takes him so long to go from one place to another that he gets himself all mixed up with watching out to see if he is moving he isn t the kind of fellow you d really want for a friend but because he doesn t do any great harm in the world we members of the club pass the time of day with him when we meet well at this time i m going to tell you about cheeko squirrel happened to go down to the pond just out of curiosity and there he saw old slowly lying on a rock sunning himself howdy mr turtle cheeko said friendly like and the old fellow being too lazy to speak winked one eye at mr squirrel have you had your dinner yet cheeko asked as if it would make him feel dreadfully bad to know that mr turtle was hungry i haven t had time to go after it and it s so near sunset now that i m afraid i ll have to wait till to morrow why don t you catch a big fat frog cheeko asked as if he couldn t rest easy until he knew that mr turtle was comfortable i haven t seen any around here lately and there isn t time to go hunting to day i don t suppose you d be willing to follow any plan of mine mr squirrel said speaking soft as silk but if you did i m almost certain i could put you in a place where all you d have to do would be to open your mouth when you wanted a bite that pleased mr turtle way down to the ground and he agreed he d do whatever mr squirrel said providing he didn t have to walk too far so cheeko set about the plan he d figured out in his mind for getting square with mr crow in the first place he daubed mr turtle all over with clay till he looked like a ball of mud and while doing this he told the old fellow how to act i m going to carry you over into the woods a little way and you are to keep as still as a mouse till you feel some one meddling with the mud i m sticking to your shell then you ll know it s time to get your dinner and all you ll have to do will be to shut your jaws on whatever is within reach i ll promise that you shall have meat that will be sweeter than the fattest frog you ever heard croak mr turtle let cheeko do what he pleased and if you ll believe it that squirrel rolled the old fellow in his covering of clay all the way from the pond up to crow s corner it must have been a terrible job but cheeko was willing to do it for the sake of getting a joke on mr crow and when he came to the foot of the tree he sat down in front of what appeared to be nothing more than a clay ball with his tail spread out over his head as if he were thinking mighty serious it wasn t long before old mr crow espied him and it really did seem as if that bird would shake himself into little pieces he was so curious to know what cheeko was doing he sat on the very tip of one of the branches looking at the odd thing until he could keep still no longer and then he hopped down by the side of cheeko what have you got with you mr squirrel he asked trying to turn the clay ball over and cheeko said careless like as if it didn t make very much difference to him whether mr crow got the information he wanted roll it over two or three times and you may know as much as i do about it mr crow twisted his head first on one side and then on the other until he had looked at the clay ball with both eyes but mr squirrel didn t offer to explain anything more and finally he grew so excited that it seemed as if he just really had to do as cheeko wanted he rolled the funny looking thing to and fro without learning anything regarding it and then began pecking at the hole in one end which mr squirrel had left open so mr turtle could get air by this time poor old mr turtle made up his slow mind that the meat cheeko told him about was near at hand and before mr crow could wink an eye out came a queer looking head with jaws that fastened on the bird s leg in a way that wasn t pleasant or comfortable there s no need of my saying that mr crow was frightened the idea of being bitten by a lump of clay nearly scared him white and up into the tree he flew caw cawing at the full strength of his lungs while mr turtle hung on the best he knew how for it must have startled him a good bit to feel that instead of getting a dinner he was going up into the air like a balloon of course old slowly couldn t make any noise but mr crow was doing that for both of them and down at the foot of the tree cheeko sat laughing until so mr porcupine declares it seemed certain he would burst just then squire owl who had been awakened by the disturbance came out to learn what the matter was but mr crow was so frightened that he couldn t give him the least little bit of information and the squire had to find out for himself being near sighted in the daytime it was quite a while before he saw mr turtle s head and then he cried out angrily what are you doing up a tree you rascal let go of mr crow s leg and go back to your pond this instant if i do that i shall break myself all to pieces mr turtle said speaking rather indistinctly because his mouth was so full and hearing the words mr squirrel laughed harder than ever until the squire began to get an idea of how it all happened this is some of your doings cheeko squirrel he said savagely call off your turtle or i ll come down there and eat you without butter you ve tried to do that a good many times and i ve always got the best of you even when it wasn t very light so don t puff yourself up with the idea that i m afraid of a big bunch of feathers like you

egotheism of the sufis or the position of the megareans shall we put him on the shelf with the stoics or the mystics with quietist pantheist determinist if life were long it might be worth while to trace emerson s affinities with the philosophic schools to collect and infer his answers to the everlasting problems of psychology and metaphysics to extract a set of coherent and reasoned opinions about knowledge and faculty experience and consciousness truth and necessity the absolute and the relative but such inquiries would only take us the further away from the essence and vitality of emerson s mind and teaching in philosophy proper emerson made no contribution of his own but accepted apparently without much examination of the other side from coleridge after kant the intuitive xa priori and realist theory respecting the sources of human knowledge and the objects that are within the cognisance of the human faculties this was his starting point and within its own sphere of thought he cannot be said to have carried it any further what he did was to light up these doctrines with the rays of ethical and poetic imagination as it has been justly put though emersonian transcendentalism is usually spoken of as a philosophy it is more justly regarded as a gospel but before dwelling more on this let us look into the record of his life of which we may say in all truth that no purer simpler and more harmonious story can be found in the annals of far shining men footnote frothingham s transcendentalism in new england a history a judicious acute and highly interesting piece of criticism i ralph waldo emerson was born at boston may he was of an ancient and honourable english stock who had transplanted themselves on one side from cheshire and bedfordshire and on the other from durham and york a hundred and seventy years before for seven or eight generations in a direct and unbroken line his forefathers had been preachers and divines not without eminence in the puritan tradition of new england his second name came into the family with rebecca waldo with whom at the end of the seventeenth century one edward emerson had intermarried and whose family had fled from the waldensian valleys and that slaughter of the saints which milton called on heaven to avenge every tributary then that made emerson what he was flowed not only from protestantism but from the protestantism of the protestant religion when we are told that puritanism inexorably locked up the intelligence of its votaries in a dark and straitened chamber it is worthy to be remembered that the genial open lucid and most comprehensive mind of emerson was the ripened product of a genealogical tree that at every stage of its growth had been vivified by puritan sap not many years after his birth emerson s mother was left a widow with narrow means and he underwent the wholesome training of frugality in youth when the time came he was sent to harvard when clough visited america a generation later the collegiate training does not appear to have struck him very favourably they learn french and history and german and a great many more things than in england but only imperfectly this was said from the standard of rugby and balliol and the method that clough calls imperfect had merits of its own the pupil lost much in a curriculum that had a certain rawness about it compared with the traditional culture that was at that moment just beginning to acquire a fresh hold within the old gray quadrangles of oxford on the other hand the training at harvard struck fewer of those superfluous roots in the mind which are only planted that they may be presently cast out again with infinite distraction and waste when his schooling was over emerson began to prepare himself for the ministrations of the pulpit and in and he preached in divers places two years later he was ordained and undertook the charge of an important unitarian church in boston it was not very long before the strain of forms comparatively moderate as it was in the unitarian body became too heavy to be borne emerson found that he could no longer accept the usual view of the communion service even in its least sacramental interpretation to him the rite was purely spiritual in origin and intent and at the best only to be retained as a commemoration the whole world he said had been full of idols and ordinances and forms when the almighty god was pleased to qualify and send forth a man to teach men that they must serve him with the heart that only that life was religious which was thoroughly good that sacrifice was smoke and forms were shadows this man lived and died true to that purpose and now with his blessed word and life before us christians must contend that it is a matter of vital importance really a duty to commemorate him by a certain form whether that form be agreeable to their understandings or not is not this to make vain the gift of god is not this to make men forget that not forms but duties not names but righteousness and love are enjoined he was willing to continue the service with that explanation and on condition that he should not himself partake of the bread and wine the congregation would fain have kept one whose transparent purity of soul had attached more than his heresy had alienated but the innovation was too great and emerson resigned his charge for some five or six years longer he continued occasionally to preach and more than one congregation would have accepted him but doubts on the subject of public prayer began to weigh upon his mind he suspected the practice by which one man offered up prayer vicariously and collectively for the assembled congregati

recesses of a tomb as yet unprofaned by tourists my friend bribed the arabs to show it to him what ensued i will give in his own words exactly as he wrote it to me i slept that night near the temple of seti and started before daybreak on the following morning with me were a cross eyed rascal named ali ali baba i named him the man from whom i got the ring which i am sending you and a small but choice assortment of his fellow thieves within an hour after sunrise we reached the valley where the tomb is it is a desolate place into which the sun pours his scorching heat all the long day through till the huge brown rocks which are strewn about become so hot that one can scarcely bear to touch them and the sand scorches the feet it was already too hot to walk so we rode on donkeys some way up the valley where a vulture floating far in the blue overhead was the only other visitor till we came to an enormous boulder polished by centuries of action of sun and sand here ali halted saying that the tomb was under the stone accordingly we dismounted and leaving the donkeys in charge of a fellah boy went up to the rock beneath it was a small hole barely large enough for a man to creep through indeed it had been dug by jackals for the doorway and some part of the cave were entirely silted up and it was by means of this jackal hole that the tomb had been discovered ali crept in on his hands and knees and i followed to find myself in a place cold after the hot outside air and in contrast with the light filled with a dazzling darkness we lit our candles and the select body of thieves having arrived i made an examination we were in a cave the size of a large room and hollowed by hand the further part of the cave being almost free from drift dust on the walls are religious paintings of the usual ptolemaic character and among them one of a majestic old man with a long white beard who is seated in a carved chair holding a wand in his hand before him passes a procession of priests bearing sacred images in the right hand corner of the tomb is the shaft of the mummy pit a square mouthed well cut in the black rock we had brought a beam of thorn wood and this was now laid across the pit and a rope made fast to it then ali who to do him justice is a courageous thief took hold of the rope and putting some candles into the breast of his robe placed his bare feet against the smooth sides of the well and began to descent with great rapidity very soon he had vanished into blackness and the agitation of the cord alone told us that anything was going on below at last the rope ceased shaking and a faint shout came rumbling up the well announcing ali s safe arrival then far below a tiny star of light appeared he had lit the candle thereby disturbing hundreds of bats that flitted up in an endless stream and as silently as spirits the rope was hauled up again and now it was my turn but as i declined to trust my neck to the hand over hand method of descent the end of the cord was made fast round my middle and i was lowered bodily into those sacred depths nor was it a pleasant journey for if the masters of the situation above had made any mistake i should have been dashed to pieces also the bats continually flew into my face and clung to my hair and i have a great dislike of bats at last after some minutes of jerking and dangling i found myself standing in a narrow passage by the side of the worthy ali covered with bats and perspiration and with the skin rubbed off my knees and knuckles then another man came down hand over hand like a sailor and as the rest were told to stop above we were ready to go on ali went first with his candle of course we each had a candle leading the way down a long passage about five feet high at length the passage widened out and we were in the tomb chamber i think the hottest and most silent place that i ever entered it was simply stifling this chamber is a square room cut in the rock and totally devoid of paintings or sculpture i held up the candles and looked round about the place were strewn the coffin lids and the mummied remains of the two bodies that the arabs had previously violated the paintings on the former were i noticed of great beauty though having no knowledge of hieroglyphics i could not decipher them beads and spicy wrappings lay around the remains which i saw were those of a man and a woman the head had been broken off the body of the man i took it up and looked at it it had been closely shaved after death i should say from the general indications and the features were disfigured with gold leaf but notwithstanding this and the shrinkage of the flesh i think the face was one of the most imposing and beautiful that i ever saw it was that of a very old man and his dead countenance still wore so calm and solemn indeed so awful a look that i grew quite superstitious though as you know i am pretty well accustomed to dead people and put the head down in a hurry there were still some wrappings left upon the face of the second body and i did not remove them but she must have been a fine large woman in her day this i take it is a portrait of amenemhat himself editor doubtless amenemhat and his wife editor there the other mummy said ali pointing to a large and solid case that seemed to have been carelessly thrown down in a corner for it was lying on its side i went up to it and carefully examined it it was well made but of perfectly plain cedar wood not an inscription not a solitary god on it never see one like him before said ali bury great hurry he no mafish no fineesh

nor always at brighton and emily would be too nervous to have her without me but we will take as many children as you please or we have room for that is like you jenny i know william will offer to take them in at home but i cannot send them without miss vincent and she cannot leave her mother who has had a sort of stroke otherwise i should try leaving them here while i am away but the poor old lady is in no state for it in fact i doubt her living long i know you have been governess by yourself these last weeks it will be well to relieve her the best way will be for us to take mysie and valetta and let them go to the high school and there is a capital day school for little boys close to st andrew s for fergus and gillian can go there too or join classes in whatever she pleases my brownie have you really room for all those oh yes the three girls in the spare room and dressing room and fergus in the little room over the porch i will write to fanny i gave her a hint and i have no doubt that primrose will be a delight to her aunt alethea poor little dear yes that makes it all easy for in the holidays i know the boys are sure of a welcome at the dear old home or hal might have one or two of them at his curacy the gong sounded for the melancholy dinner that had to go on all the same and in the midst all were startled by the arrival of a telegram which macrae looking awestruck actually delivered to harry instead of to his mistress but it was not from ceylon it was from colonel mohun from beechcroft coming going with you send children here never were twenty words including addresses more satisfactory the tears came for the first time to lady merrifield s eyes at the kindness of her brothers and harry was quite satisfied that his uncle would be a far better escort than himself or macrae aunt jane went off to send her telegram home and write some needful letters and lady merrifield announced her arrangements to those whom they concerned oh mamma don t

animals than your four selves you must ask her only do not be surprised or put out if she refuses for i don t believe you can keep anything there off the three younger ones went gillian observing i don t see how they can unless it was quiz but mamma don t you think i might go to beechcroft with primrose i should be so much quieter working for the examination there and i could send my exercises to miss vincent and then i should keep up prim s lessons your aunt alethea will i know like doing that my dear and i am afraid to turn those creatures loose on the aunts without some one to look after them and their clothes fanny will be very helpful but it will not do to throw too much on her oh i thought they would have lois there would not be room for her besides that i don t think it would suit your aunts you and mysie ought to do all the mending for yourselves and fergus and what valetta cannot manage i know you would rather be at beechcroft my dear but in this distress and difficulty some individual likings must be given up yes mamma lady merrifield looked rather dubiously at her daughter she had very little time and did not want to have an argument nor to elicit murmurs yet it might be better to see what was in gillian s mind before it was too late mothers very fond of their own sisters cannot always understand why it is not the same with their daughters who inherit another element of inherited character and of another generation and who have not been welded together with the aunts in childhood my dear she said you know i am quite ready to hear if you have any real reasonable objection to this arrangement no mamma i don t think i have said gillian thoughtfully the not liking always meeting a lot of strangers nor the general bustle is all nonsense i know quite well i see it is best for the children but i should like to know exactly who is to be in authority over them certainly aunt jane replied lady merrifield she must be the ultimate authority of course you will check the younger ones in anything going wrong as you would here and very likely there will be more restrictions aunt ada has to be considered and it will be a town life but remember that your aunt is mistress of the house and that even if you do think her arrangements uncalled for it is your duty to help the others to submit cheerfully say anything you please fully and freely in your

degraf was staying with her for a time they had all spent the summer with uncle john at millville and had only returned to new york a few days before beth s home was in ohio but there was so little sympathy between the girl and her parents that she was happy only when away from them her mother was uncle john s sister but as selfish and cold as uncle john was generous and genial beth s father was a genius and a professor of music one of those geniuses who live only in their own atmosphere and forget there is a world around them so beth had a loveless and disappointed childhood and only after uncle john arrived from the far west and took his three nieces under his wing as he said did her life assume any brightness or interest her new surroundings however had developed beth s character wonderfully and although she still had her periods of sullen depression she was generally as gay and lovable as her two cousins but in a quieter and more self possessed way louise was the eldest a fair dainty creature with that indescribable air which invariably wins the admiring regard of all beholders whatever gown the girl wore looked appropriate and becoming and her manner was as delightful as her appearance she was somewhat frivolous and designing in character but warm hearted and staunch in her friendships indeed louise was one of those girls who are so complex as to be a puzzle to everyone including themselves beth degraf was the beauty of the group of three and she also possessed great depth of character beth did not like herself very well and was always afraid others would fail to like her so she did not win friends as easily as did louise but those who knew the beautiful girl intimately could read much to admire in the depth of her great dark eyes and she was not the least interesting of the three nieces whose fortunes had been so greatly influenced by aunt jane and uncle john merrick but patricia doyle usually called patsy by her friends was after all the general favorite with strangers and friends alike there was a subtle magnetism about the girl s laughing freckled face and dancing blue eyes that could not well be resisted patsy was not beautiful she was not accomplished she had no especial air of distinction but she was winning from the top of her red hair to the tips of her toes and so absolutely unaffected that she won all hearts and for wisdom she s got solomon beat to a frazzle declared the major to uncle john in discussing his daughter s character but it is possible that major doyle was prejudiced well what s to be done demanded louise for the second time we don t vote in ken s district remarked the major or there would be six votes to his credit and that would beat my own record by four ken is so impressionable that i m afraid this defeat will ruin his life said beth softly i wish we could get him away couldn t we get him to withdraw he might be suddenly called to europe suggested louise that would take him away from the place and give him a change of scene patsy shook her head kenneth isn t a coward she said he won t run away he must accept his defeat like a man and some time try again eh uncle john uncle john turned around and regarded his three nieces critically what makes you think he will be defeated he asked he says so himself answered patsy he writes me he can see no hope for the people are all against him added louise pah said uncle john contemptuously what else does the idiot say that he s lonely and discouraged and had to pour out his heart to some one or go wild said patsy the tears of sympathy filling her eyes and you girls propose to sit down and allow all this inquired their uncle sternly we answered louise lifting her brows and making a pretty gesture what can we do go to work said uncle john how asked patsy eagerly politics is a game declared mr merrick it s never won until the last card is played and success doesn t lie so much in the cards as the way you play em here are three girls with plenty of shrewdness and energy why don t you take a hand in the game and win it oh uncle john the proposition was certainly disconcerting at first yes yes laughed the major derisively put on some blue stockings read the history of woman s suffrage cultivate a liking for depraved eggs and then face kenneth s enraged constituents i shouldn t mind daddy if it would help kenneth any declared patsy

exercise your wits and work earnestly for the cause there are a hundred ways to do that mention a few proposed the major i will when i get to elmhurst and look over the ground answered uncle john you

anything then he walked straight up to charles and held out his dark hand good evening he said you are the host my soul s sight tells me so good shot sir charles answered these fellows have to be quick witted you know mrs mackenzie or they d never get on at it the seer gazed about him and smiled blankly at a person or two whose faces he seemed to recognise from a previous existence then charles began to ask him a few simple questions not about himself but about me just to test him he answered most of them with surprising correctness his name his name begins with an s i think you call him seymour he paused long between each clause as if the facts were revealed to him slowly seymour wilbraham earl of strafford no not earl of strafford seymour wilbraham wentworth there seems to be

apparently for confirmation a lady came to his rescue wentworth was the surname of the great earl of strafford she murmured gently and i was wondering as you spoke whether mr wentworth might possibly be descended from him he is the seer replied instantly with a flash of those dark eyes and i thought this curious for though my father always maintained the reality of the relationship there was one link wanting to complete the pedigree he could not make sure that the hon thomas wilbraham wentworth was the father of jonathan wentworth the bristol horse dealer from whom we are descended where was

games and go in when it rains for it rains in mo as it does everywhere else only it rains lemonade and the lightning in the sky resembles the most beautiful fireworks and the thunder is usually a chorus from the opera of tannhauser no one ever dies in this valley and the people are always young and beautiful there is the king and a queen besides several princes and princesses but it is not much use being a prince in mo because the king can not die therefore a prince is a prince to the end of his days and his days never end strange things occur in this strange land as you may imagine and while i relate some of these you will learn more of the peculiar features of the beautiful valley the second surprise the strange adventures of the king s head a good many years ago the magical monarch of mo became annoyed by the purple dragon which came down from the mountains and ate up a patch of his best chocolate caramels just as they were getting ripe so the king went out to the sword tree and picked a long sharp sword and tied it to his belt and went away to the mountains to fight the purple dragon the people all applauded him saying one to another our king is a good king he will destroy this naughty purple dragon and we shall be able to eat the caramels ourselves but the dragon was not alone naughty it was big and fierce and strong and did not want to be destroyed at all therefore the king had a terrible fight with the purple dragon and cut it with his sword in several places so that the raspberry juice which ran in its veins squirted all over the ground it is always difficult to kill dragons they are by nature thick skinned and tough as doubtless every one has heard besides you must not forget that this was a purple dragon and all scientists who have studied deeply the character of dragons say those of a purple color at the most disagreeable to fight with so all the king s cutting and slashing had no effect upon the monster other than to make him angry forgetful of the respect due to a crowned king the wicked dragon presently opening wide its jaws and bit his majesty s head clean off his body then he swallowed it of course the king realized it was useless to continue to fight after that for he could not see where the dragon was so he turned and tried to find his way back to his people but at every other step he would bump into a tree which made the naughty dragon laugh at him furthermore he could not tell in which direction he was going which is an unpleasant feeling under any circumstances at last some of the people came to see if the king had succeeded in destroying the dragon and found their monarch running around in a circle bumping into trees and rocks but not getting a step nearer home so they took his hand and led him back to the palace where every one was filled with sorrow at the sad sight of the headless king indeed his devoted subjects for the first time in their lives came as near to weeping as an inhabitant of the valley of mo can never mind said the king cheerfully i can get along very well without a head and as a matter of fact the loss has its advantages i shall not be obliged to brush my hair or clean my teeth or wash my ears so do not grieve i beg of you but be happy and joyful as you were before which showed the king had a good heart and after all a good heart is better than a head any say the people hearing him speak out of his neck for he had no mouth immediately began to laugh which in a short time led to their being as happy as ever but the queen was not contented my love she said to him i can not kiss you any more and that will break my heart thereupon the king sent word throughout the valley that any one who could procure for him a new head should wed one of the princesses the princesses were all exceedingly pretty girls and so it was not long before one man made a very nice head out of candy and brought it to the king it did not look exactly like the old head but the efface was very sweet nevertheless so the king put it on and the queen kissed it at once with much satisfaction the young man had put a pair of glass eyes in the head with which the king could see very well after he got used to them according to the royal promise the young man was now called into the palace and asked to take his pick of the princesses there were all so sweet and lady like that he had some trouble in making a choice but at last he took the biggest thinking that he would thus secure the greatest reward and they were married amid great rejoicing but a few days afterward the king was caught out in a rainstorm and before he could get home his new head had melted in the great shower of lemonade that fell only the glass eyes were left and these he put in his pocket and went sorrowfully to tell the queen of his new misfortune then another young man who wanted to marry a princess made the king a head out of dough sticking in it the glass eyes and the king tried it on and found that it fitted very well so the young man was given the next biggest princess but the following day the sun chance to shine extremely hot and when the king walked out it baked his dough head into bread at which the monarch felt very light headed and when the birds saw the bread they flew down from the trees perched upon the king s shoulder and quickly ate up his new head all but the glass eyes again the good king was forced to go home to the queen without a head and the lady firmly declared that this time her husband must have a head warranted to last at least as long as the honeymoon of the young man who made it which was not at all unreasonable under the circumstances so a request was sent to all loyal subjects throughout the valley asking them to find a head for thei

windsor blenheim oxford the bath and bristol all into one letter all those remarkable places lying in a line as it were in one point of the compass as to have made my letter too long or my observations too light and superficial as others have done before me this letter will divide the weighty task and consequently make it sit lighter on the memory be pleasanter to the reader and make my progress the more regular i shall therefore take in hampton court and windsor in this journey the first at my setting out and the last at my return and the rest as their situation demands as i came down from kingston in my last circuit by the south bank of the thames on the surrey side of the river so i go up to hampton court now on the north bank and on the middlesex side which i mention because as the sides of the country bordering on the river lie parallel so the beauty of the country the pleasant situations the glory of innumerable fine buildings noblemen s and gentlemen s houses and citizens retreats are so equal a match to what i had described on the other side that one knows not which to give the preference to but as i must speak of them again when i come to write of the county of middlesex which i have now purposely omitted so i pass them over here except the palace of hampton only which i mentioned in middlesex for the reasons above hampton court lies on the north bank of the river thames about two small miles from kingston and on the road from staines to kingston bridge so that the road straightening the parks a little they were obliged to part the parks and

country that they would not interrupt the course of the road or cause the poor people to go out of the way of their business to or from the markets and fairs for any pleasure of their own whatsoever the palace of hampton court was first founded and built from the ground by that great statesman and favourite of king henry viii cardinal wolsey and if it be a just observation anywhere as is made from the situation of the old abbeys and monasteries the clergy were excellent judges of the beauty and pleasantness of the country and chose always to plant in the best i say if it was a just observation in any case it was in this for if there be a situation on the whole river between staines bridge and windsor bridge pleasanter than another it is this of hampton close to the river yet not offended by the rising of its waters in floods or storms near to the reflux of the tides but not quite so near as to be affected with any foulness of the water which the flowing of the tides generally is the occasion of the gardens extend almost to the bank of the river yet are never overflowed nor are there any marshes on either side the river to make the waters stagnate or the air unwholesome on that account the river is high enough to be navigable and low enough to be a little pleasantly rapid so that the stream looks always cheerful not slow and sleeping like a pond this keeps the waters always clear and clean the bottom in view the fish playing and in sight and in a word it has everything that can make an inland or as i may call it a country river pleasant and agreeable i shall sing you no songs here of the river in the first person of a water nymph a goddess and i know not what according to the humour of the ancient poets i shall talk nothing of the marriage of old isis the male river with the beautiful thame the female river a whimsey as simple as the subject was empty but i shall speak of the river as occasion presents as it really is made glorious by the splendour of its shores gilded with noble palaces strong fortifications large hospitals and public buildings with the greatest bridge and the greatest city in the world made famous by the opulence of its merchants the increase and extensiveness of its commerce by its invincible navies and by the innumerable fleets of ships sailing upon it to and from all parts of the world as i meet with the river upwards in my travels through the inland country i shall speak of it as it is the channel for conveying an infinite quantity of provisions from remote counties to london and enriching all the counties

who wouldn t go along and wouldn t keep still but just kept bobbing up and down two evenings later when anne went over to the dix place she and theodora drifted into a conversation about ludovic theodora who was the most industrious soul alive and had a mania for fancy work into the bargain was busying her smooth plump fingers with a very elaborate battenburg lace centre piece anne was lying back in a little rocker with her slim hands folded in her lap watching theodora she realized that theodora was very handsome in a stately juno like fashion of firm white flesh large clearly chiselled outlines and great cowey brown eyes when theodora was not smiling she looked very imposing anne thought it likely that ludovic held her in awe did you and ludovic talk about christian science all saturday evening she asked theodora overflowed into a smile yes and we even quarrelled over it at least i did ludovic wouldn t quarrel with anyone you have to fight air when you spar with him i hate to square up to a person who won t hit back theodora said anne coaxingly i am going to be curious and impertinent you can snub me if you like why don t you and ludovic get married theodora laughed comfortably that s the question grafton folks have been asking for quite a while i reckon anne well i d have no objection to marrying ludovic that s frank enough for you isn t it but it s not easy to marry a man unless he asks you and ludovic has never asked me is he too shy persisted anne since theodora was in the mood she meant to sift this puzzling affair to the bottom theodora dropped her work and looked meditatively out over the green slopes of the summer world no i don t think it is that ludovic isn t shy it s just his way the speed way the speeds are all dreadfully deliberate they spend years thinking over a thing before they make up their minds to do it sometimes they get so much in the habit of thinking about it that they never get over it like old alder speed who was always talking of going to england to see his brother but never went though there was no earthly reason why he shouldn t they re not lazy you know but they love to take their time and ludovic is just an aggravated case of speedism suggested anne exactly he never hurried in his life why he has been thinking for the last six years of getting his house painted he talks it over with me every little while and picks out the colour and there the matter stays he s fond of me and he means to ask me to have him sometime the only question is will the time ever come why don t you hurry him up asked anne impatiently theodora went back to her stitches with another laugh if ludovic could be hurried up i m not the one to do it i m too shy it sounds ridiculous to hear a woman of my age and inches say that but it is true of course i know it s the only way any speed ever did make out to get married for instance there s a cousin of mine married to ludovic s brother i don t say she proposed to him out and out but mind you anne it wasn t far from it i couldn t do anything like that i did try once when i realized that i was getting sere and mellow and all the girls of my generation were going off on either hand i tried to give ludovic a hint but it stuck in my throat and now i don t mind if i don t change dix to speed until i take the initiative it will be dix to the end of life ludovic doesn t realize that we are growing old you know he thinks we are giddy young folks yet with plenty of time before us that s the speed failing they never find out they re alive until they re dead you re fond of ludovic aren t you asked anne detecting a note of real bitterness among theodora s paradoxes laws yes said theodora candidly she did not think it worth while to blush over so settled a fact i think the world and all of ludovic and he certainly does need somebody to look after him he s neglected he looks frayed you can see that for yourself that old aunt of his looks after his house in some fashion but she doesn t look after him and he s coming now to the age when a man needs to be looked after and coddled a bit i m lonesome here and ludovic is lonesome up there and it does seem ridiculous doesn t it i don t wonder that we re the standing joke of grafton goodness knows i laugh at it enough myself i ve sometimes thought that if ludovic could be made jealous it might spur him along but i never could flirt and there s nobody to flirt with if i could everybody hereabouts looks upon me as ludovic s property and nobody would dream of interfering with him theodora cried anne i have a plan now what are you going to do exclaimed theodora anne told her at first theodora laughed and protested in the end she yielded somewhat doubtfully overborne by anne s enthusiasm well try it then she said resignedly if ludovic gets mad and leaves me i ll be worse off than ever but nothing venture nothing win and there is a fighting chance i suppose besides i must admit i m tired of his dilly dallying anne went back to echo lodge tingling with delight in her plot she hunted up arnold sherman and told him what was required of him arnold sherman listened and laughed he was an elderly widower an intimate friend of stephen irving and had come down to spend part of the summer with him and his wife in prince edward island he was handsome in a mature style and he had a dash of mischief in him still so that he entered readily enough into anne s plan it amused him to think of hurrying ludovic speed and he knew that theodora dix could be depended on to do her part the comedy would not be dull

drive before us i hope you don t mind driving i was going to have the old travelling carriage in which my grandfather your great grand uncle went to court when william iv was king it is all right they built well in those days and it has been kept in perfect order but i think i have done better i have sent the carriage in which i travel myself the horses are of my own breeding and relays of them shall take us all the way i hope you like horses they have long been one of my greatest interests in life i love them sir and i am happy to say i have many of my own my father gave me a horse farm for myself when i was eighteen i devoted myself to it and it has gone on before i came away my steward gave me a memorandum that we have in my own place more than a thousand nearly all good i am glad my boy another link between us just fancy what a delight it will be sir to see so much of england and with you thank you again my boy i will tell you all about your future home and its surroundings as we go we shall travel in old fashioned state i tell you my grandfather always drove four in hand and so shall we oh thanks sir thanks may i take the ribbons sometimes whenever you choose adam the team is your own every horse we use to day is to be your own you are too generous uncle not at all only an old man s selfish pleasure it is not every day that an heir to the old home comes back and oh by the way no we had better turn in now i shall tell you the rest in the morning chapter ii the caswalls of castra regis mr salton had all his life been an early riser and necessarily an early waker but early as he woke on the next morning and although there was an excuse for not prolonging sleep in the constant whirr and rattle of the donkey engine winches of the great ship he met the eyes of adam fixed on him from his berth his grand nephew had given him the sofa occupying the lower berth himself the old man despite his great strength and normal activity was somewhat tired by his long journey of the day before and the prolonged and exciting interview which followed it so he was glad to lie still and rest his body whilst his mind was actively exercised in taking in all he could of his strange surroundings adam too after the pastoral habit to which he had been bred woke with the dawn and was ready to enter on the experiences of the new day whenever it might suit his elder companion it was little wonder then that so soon as each realised the other s readiness they simultaneously jumped up and began to dress the steward had by previous instructions early breakfast prepared and it was not long before they went down the gangway on shore in search of the carriage they found mr salton s bailiff looking out for them on the dock and he brought them at once to where the carriage was waiting in the street richard salton pointed out with pride to his young companion the suitability of the vehicle for every need of travel to it were harnessed four useful horses with a postillion to each pair see said the old man proudly how it has all the luxuries of useful travel silence and isolation as well as speed there is nothing to obstruct the view of those travelling and no one to overhear what they may say i have used that trap for a quarter of a century and i never saw one more suitable for travel you shall test it shortly we are going to drive through the heart of england and as we go i ll tell you what i was speaking of last night our route is to be by salisbury bath bristol cheltenham worcester stafford and so home adam remained silent a few minutes during which he seemed all eyes for he perpetually ranged the whole circle of the horizon has our journey to day sir he asked any special relation to what you said last night that you wanted to tell me not directly but indirectly everything won t you tell me now i see we cannot be overheard and if anything strikes you as we go along just run it in i shall understand so old salton spoke to begin at the beginning adam that lecture of yours on the romans in britain a report of which you posted to me set me thinking in addition to telling me your tastes i wrote to you at once and asked you to come home for it struck me that if you were fond of historical research as seemed a fact this was exactly the place for you in addition to its being the home of your own forbears if you could learn so much of the british romans so far away in new south wales where there cannot be even a tradition of them what might you not make of the same amount of study on the very spot where we are going is in the real heart of the old kingdom of mercia where there are traces of all the various nationalities which made up the conglomerate which became britain i rather gathered that you had some more definite more personal reason for my hurrying after all history can keep except in the making quite right my boy i had a reason such as you very wisely guessed i was anxious for you to be here when a rather important phase of our local history occurred what is that if i may ask sir certainly the principal landowner of our part of the county is on his way home and there will be a great home coming which you may care to see the fact is for more than a century the various owners in the succession here with the exception of a short time have lived abroad how is that sir if i may ask the great house and

to you who were my public and my critic of all that such a recollection implies of saddest and sweetest to both of us it would become neither of us to speak before the world nor would it be possible for us to speak of it to one another with voices that did not falter enough that what is in my heart when i write thus will be fully known to yours and my desire is that you who are a witness how if this art of poetry had been a less earnest object to me it must have fallen from exhausted hands before this day that you who have shared with me in things bitter and sweet softening or enhancing them every day that you who hold with me over all sense of loss and transiency one hope by one name may accept from me the inscription of these volumes the exponents of a few years of an existence which has been sustained and comforted by you as well as given somewhat more faint hearted than i used to be it is my fancy thus to seem to return to a visible personal dependence on you as if indeed i were a child again to conjure your beloved image between myself and the public so as to be sure of one smile and to satisfy my heart while i sanctify my ambition by associating with the great pursuit of my life its tenderest and holiest affection your e b b london wimpole street preface to the first collected edition of mrs browning s poems the collection here offered to the public consists of poems which have been written in the interim between the period of the publication of my seraphim and the present variously coloured or perhaps shadowed by the life of which they are the natural expression and with the exception of a few contributions to english or american periodicals are printed now for the first time as the first poem of this collection the drama of exile is the longest and most important work to me which i ever trusted into the current of publication i may be pardoned for entreating the reader s attention to the fact that i decided on publishing it after considerable hesitation and doubt the subject of the drama rather fastened on me than was chosen and the form approaching the model of the greek tragedy shaped itself under my hand rather by force of pleasure than of design but when the excitement of composition had subsided i felt afraid of my position my subject was the new and strange experience of the fallen humanity as it went forth from paradise into the wilderness with a peculiar reference to eve s allotted grief which considering that self sacrifice belonged to her womanhood and the consciousness of originating the fall to her offence appeared to me imperfectly apprehended hitherto and more expressible by a woman than a man there was room at least for lyrical emotion in those first steps into the wilderness in that first sense of desolation after wrath in that first audible gathering of the recriminating groan of the whole creation in that first darkening of the hills from the recoiling feet of angels and in that first silence of the voice of god and i took pleasure in driving in like a pile stroke upon stroke the idea of exile admitting lucifer as an extreme adam to represent the ultimate tendencies of sin and loss that it might be strong to bear up the contrary idea of the heavenly love and purity but when all was done i felt afraid as i said before of my position i had promised my own prudence to shut close the gates of eden between milton and myself so that none might say i dared to walk in his footsteps he should be within i thought with his adam and eve unfallen or falling and i without with my exiles i also an exile it would not do the subject and his glory covering it swept through the gates and i stood full in it against my will and contrary to my vow till i shrank back fearing almost desponding hesitating to venture even a passing association with our great poet before the face of the public whether at last i took courage for the venture by a sudden revival of that love of manuscript which should be classed by moral philosophers among the natural affections or by the encouraging voice of a dear friend it is not interesting to the reader to inquire neither could the fact affect the question since i bear of course my own responsibilities for the rest milton is too high and i am too low to render it necessary for me to disavow any rash emulation of his divine faculty on his own ground while enough individuality will be granted i hope to my poem to rescue me from that imputation of plagiarism which should be too servile a thing for every sincere thinker after all and at the worst i have only attempted in respect to milton what the greek dramatists achieved lawfully in respect to homer they constructed dramas on trojan ground they raised on the buskin and even clasped with the sock the feet of homeric heroes yet they neither imitated their homer nor emasculated him the agamemnon of x schylus who died in the bath did no harm to nor suffered any harm from the agamemnon of homer who bearded achilles to this analogy the more favourable to me from the obvious exception in it that homer s subject was his own possibly by creation whereas milton s was his own by illustration only i appeal to this analogy not to this comparison be it understood i appeal for the analogy of the stronger may apply to the weaker and the reader may have patience with the weakest while she suggests the application on a graver point i must take leave to touch in further reference to my dramatic poem the divine saviour is represented in vision towards the close speaking and transfigured and it has

vaguely that it was somehow embarrassing the fact of mr anderson being accompanied by his daughter kurt was afraid of his father but then what did it matter when he returned to the yard he found the rancher sitting in the shade of one of the few apple trees and the young lady was standing near in the act of removing bonnet and veil she had thrown the linen coat over the seat of an old wagon bed

the cup and stared then hurriedly with flushing face he bent over to recover and refill it ex excuse me i m clumsy he managed to say and as he handed the cup to her he averted his gaze for more than a year the memory of this very girl had haunted him he had seen her twice the first time at the close of his one year of college at the university of california and the second time on the street in spokane in a glance he had recognized the strong lithe figure the sunny hair the rare golden tint of her complexion the blue eyes warm and direct and he had sustained a shock which momentarily confused him good water hey dissented anderson after drinking a second cup boy that s wet but it ain t water to drink come down in the foot hills an i ll show you my ranch s called many waters an you

listening to her conversation with these two rather seedy persons i don t really know what i can do for you mrs hughs i ll speak to mr dallison and to mr hilary too yes ma am thank you ma am with a smile which seemed to deprecate its own appearance cecilia grasped her skirts and crossed the road i hope i wasn t unsympathetic she thought looking back at the three figures on the edge of the pavement the old man with his papers and his discoloured nose thrust upwards under iron rimmed spectacles the seamstress in her black dress the skimpy little boy neither speaking nor moving they were looking out before them at the traffic and something in cecilia revolted at this sight it was lifeless hopeless unaesthetic what can one do she thought for women like mrs hughs who always look like that and that poor old man i suppose i oughtn t to have bought that dress but stephen is tired of this she turned out of the main street into a road preserved from commoner forms of traffic and stopped at a long low house half hidden behind the trees of its front garden it was the residence of hilary dallison her husband s brother and himself the husband of bianca her own sister the queer conceit came to cecilia that it resembled hilary its look was kindly and uncertain its colour a palish tan the eyebrows of its windows rather straight than arched and those deep set eyes the windows twinkled hospitably it had as it were a sparse moustache and beard of creepers and dark marks here and there like the lines and shadows on the faces of those who think too much beside it and apart though connected by a passage a studio stood and about that studio of white rough cast with a black oak door and peacock blue paint was something a little hard and fugitive well suited to bianca who used it indeed to paint in it seemed to stand with its eyes on the house shrinking defiantly from too close company as though it could not entirely give itself to anything cecilia who often worried over the relations between her sister and her brother in law suddenly felt how fitting and symbolical this was but mistrusting inspirations which experience told her committed one too much she walked

it was her habit to do towards everyone for she had been handed down clearer and paler with each generation till she had at last lost all the peculiar virtues of dogs that bait the bull speaking the word miranda mrs stephen dallison tried to pat this daughter of the house the little bulldog withdrew from her caress being also unaccustomed to commit herself mondays were blanca s days and cecilia made her way towards the studio it was a large high room full of people motionless by himself close to the door stood an old man very thin and rather bent with silvery hair and a thin silvery beard grasped in his transparent fingers he was dressed in a suit of smoke grey cottage tweed which smelt of peat and an oxford shirt whose collar ceasing prematurely exposed a lean brown neck his trousers too ended very soon and showed light socks in his attitude there was something suggestive of the patience and determination of a mule at cecilia s approach he raised his eyes it was at once apparent why in so full a room he was standing alone those blue eyes looked as if he were about to utter a prophetic statement they have been speaking to me of an execution he said cecilia made a nervous movement yes father to take life went on the old man in a voice which though charged with strong emotion seemed to be speaking to itself was the chief mark of the insensate barbarism still prevailing in those days it sprang from that most irreligious fetish the belief in the permanence of the individual ego after death from the worship of that fetish had come all the sorrows of the human race cecilia with an involuntary quiver of her little bag said father how can you they did not stop to love each other in this life they were so sure they had all eternity to do it in the doctrine was an

always together one and all bubbling over with the innocent jollity born of healthful exercise people passing in the road below looked up and smiled involuntarily at the red cheeked lads and lasses filling the frosty air with peals of laughter and cries of triumph as they flew by in every conceivable attitude for the fun was at its height now and the oldest and gravest observers felt a glow of pleasure as they looked remembering their own young days jack take me down that coast joe said i wouldn t dare to do it so i must commanded jill as they paused for breath after the long trudge up hill jill of course was not her real name but had been given because of her friendship with jack who so admired janey pecq s spirit and fun i guess i wouldn t it is very bumpy and ends in a big drift not half so nice as this one hop on and we ll have a good spin across the pond and jack brought thunderbolt round with a skilful swing and an engaging air that would have won obedience from anybody but wilful jill it is very nice but i won t be told i don t dare by any boy in the world if you are afraid i ll go alone and before he could speak she had snatched the rope from his hand thrown herself upon the sled and was off helter skelter down the most dangerous coast on the hill side she did not get far however for starting in a hurry she did not guide her steed with care and the red charger landed her in the snow half way down where she lay laughing till jack came to pick her up if you will go i ll take you down all right i m not afraid for i ve done it a dozen times with the other fellows but we gave it up because it is short and bad he said still good natured though a little hurt at the charge of cowardice for jack was as brave as a little lion and with the best sort of bravery the courage to do right so it is but i must do it a few times or joe will plague me and spoil my fun to night answered jill shaking her skirts and rubbing her blue hands wet and cold with the snow here put these on i never use them keep them if they fit i only carry them to please mother and jack pulled out a pair of red mittens with the air of a boy used to giving away they are lovely warm and they do fit must be too small for your paws so i ll knit you a new pair for christmas and make you wear them too said jill putting on the mittens with a nod of thanks and ending her speech with a stamp of her rubber boots to enforce her threat jack laughed and up they trudged to the spot whence the three coasts diverged now which will you have he asked with a warning look in the honest blue eyes which often unconsciously controlled naughty jill against her will that one and the red mitten pointed firmly to the perilous path just tried you will do it i will come on then and hold tight jack s smile was gone now and he waited without a word while jill tucked herself up then took his place in front and off they went on the brief breathless trip straight into the drift by the fence below i don t see anything very awful in that come up and have another joe is watching us and i d like to show him that we aren t afraid of anything said jill with a defiant glance at a distant boy who had paused to watch the descent it is a regular go bang if that is what you like answered jack as they plowed their way up again it is you boys think girls like little mean coasts without any fun or danger in them as if we couldn t be brave and strong as well as you give me three go bangs and then we ll stop my tumble doesn t count so give me two more and then i ll be good jill took her seat as she spoke and looked up with such a rosy pleading face that jack gave in at once and down they went again raising a cloud of glittering snow dust as they reined up in fine style with their feet on the fence it s just splendid now one more cried jill excited by the cheers of a sleighing party passing below proud of his skill jack marched back resolved to make the third go the crowning achievement of the afternoon while jill pranced after him as lightly as if the big boots were the famous seven leagued ones and chattering about the candy scrape and whether there would be nuts or not so full were they of this important question that they piled on hap hazard and started off still talking so busily that jill forgot to hold tight and jack to steer carefully alas for the candy scrape that never was to be alas for poor thunderbolt blindly setting forth on the last trip he ever made and oh alas for jack and jill who wilfully chose the wrong road and ended their fun for the winter no one knew how it happened but instead of landing in the drift or at the fence there was a great crash against the bars a dreadful plunge off the steep bank a sudden scattering of girl boy sled fence earth and snow all about the road two cries and then silence i knew they d do it and standing on the post where he had perched joe waved his arms and shouted smash up smash up run run like a raven croaking over a battlefield when the fight was done down rushed boys and girls ready to laugh or cry as the case might be for accidents will happen on the best regulated coasting grounds they found

this sinful world passion and prejudice should fail to stir the mind one learned coleopterist will fill ten attractive volumes with descriptions of species of beetles nine tenths of which are immediately declared by his brother beetle mongers to be no species at all the truth is that the number of distinguishable living creatures almost surpasses imagination at least such kinds of insects alone have been described and may be identified in collections and the number of separable kinds of living things is under estimated at half a million seeing that most of these obvious kinds have their accidental varieties and that they often shade into others by imperceptible degrees it may well be imagined that the task of distinguishing between what is permanent and what fleeting what is a species and what a mere variety is sufficiently formidable but is it not possible to apply a test whereby a true species may be known from a mere variety is there no criterion of species great authorities affirm that there is that the unions of members of the same species are always fertile while those of distinct species are either sterile or their offspring called hybrids are so it is affirmed not only that this is an experimental fact but that it is a provision for the preservation of the purity of species such a criterion as this would be invaluable but unfortunately not only is it not obvious how to apply it in the great majority of cases in which its aid is needed but its general validity is stoutly denied the hon and rev mr herbert a most trustworthy authority not only asserts as the result of his own observations and experiments that many hybrids are quite as fertile as the parent species but he goes so far as to assert that the particular plant crinum capense is much more fertile when crossed by a distinct species than when fertilised by its proper pollen on the other hand the famous gaertner though he took the greatest pains to cross the primrose and the cowslip succeeded only once or twice in several years and yet it is a well established fact that the primrose and the cowslip are only varieties of the same kind of plant again such cases as the following are well established the female of species a if crossed with the male of species b is fertile but if the female of b is crossed with the male of a she remains barren facts of this kind destroy the value of the supposed criterion if weary of the endless difficulties involved in the determination of species the investigator contenting himself with the rough practical distinction of separable kinds endeavours to study them as they occur in nature to ascertain their relations to the conditions which surround them their mutual harmonies and discordancies of structure the bond of union of their present and their past history he finds himself according to the received notions in a mighty maze and with at most the dimmest adumbration of a plan if he starts with any one clear conviction it is that every part of a living creature is cunningly adapted to some special use in its life has not his paley told him that that seemingly useless organ the spleen is beautifully adjusted as so much packing between the other organs and yet at the outset of his studies he finds that no adaptive reason whatsoever can be given for one half of the peculiarities of vegetable structure he also discovers rudimentary teeth which are never used in the gums of the young calf and in those of the foetal whale insects which never bite have rudimental jaws and others which never fly have rudimental wings naturally blind creatures have rudimental eyes and the halt have rudimentary limbs so again no animal or plant puts on its perfect form at once but all have to start from the same point however various the course which each has to pursue not only men and horses and cats and dogs lobsters and beetles periwinkles and mussels but even the very sponges and animalcules commence their existence under forms which are essentially undistinguishable and this is true of all the infinite variety of plants nay more all living beings march side by side along the high road of development and separate the later the more like they are like people leaving church who all go down the aisle but having reached the door some turn into the parsonage others go down the village and others part only in the next parish a man in his development runs for a little while parallel with though never passing through the form of the meanest worm then travels for a space beside the fish then journeys along with the bird and the reptile for his fellow travellers and only at last after a brief companionship with the highest of the four footed and four handed world rises into the dignity of pure manhood no competent thinker of the present day dreams of explaining these indubitable facts by the notion of the existence of unknown and undiscoverable adaptations to purpose and we would remind those who ignorant of the facts must be moved by authority that no one has asserted the incompetence of the doctrine of final causes in its application to physiology and anatomy more strongly than our own eminent anatomist professor owen who speaking of such cases says on the nature of limbs pp i think it will be obvious that the principle of final adaptations fails to satisfy all the conditions of the problem but if the doctrine of final causes will not help us to comprehend the anomalies of living structure the principle of adaptation must surely lead us to understand why certain living beings are found in certain regions of the world and not in others the palm as we know will not grow in our climate nor the oak in greenland the white bear cannot live where the tiger

note to septimius felton and forms a link in the interesting chain of evidence connecting that romance with the dolliver romance with the plan respecting thoreau he combined the idea of writing an autobiographical preface wherein the wayside was to be described after the manner of his introduction to the mosses from an old manse but so far as is known nothing of this was ever actually committed to paper beginning with the idea of producing an english romance fragments of which remain to us in the ancestral footstep and the incomplete work known as doctor grimshawe s secret he replaced these by another design of which septimius felton represents the partial execution but that elaborate study yielded in its turn to the dolliver romance the last named work had the author lived to carry it out would doubtless have become the vehicle of a profound and pathetic drama based on the instinctive yearning of man for an immortal existence the attempted gratification of which would have been set forth in a variety of ways first through the selfish old sensualist colonel dabney who greedily seized the mysterious elixir and took such a draught of it that he perished on the spot then through the simple old grandsir anxious to live for pansie s sake and perhaps through pansie herself who coming into the enjoyment of some ennobling love would wish to defeat death so that she might always keep the perfection of her mundane happiness all these forms of striving to be made the adumbration of a higher one the shadow play that should direct our minds to the true immortality beyond this world g p l the dolliver romance a scene from the dolliver romance dr dolliver a worthy personage of extreme antiquity was aroused rather prematurely one summer morning by the shouts of the child pansie in an adjoining chamber summoning old martha who performed the duties of nurse housekeeper and kitchen maid in the doctor s establishment to take up her little ladyship and dress her the old gentleman woke with more than his customary alacrity and after taking a moment to gather his wits about him pulled aside the faded moreen curtains of his ancient bed and thrust his head into a beam of sunshine that caused him to wink and withdraw it again this transitory glimpse of good dr dolliver showed a flannel night cap fringed round with stray locks of silvery white hair and surmounting a meagre and duskily yellow visage which was crossed and criss crossed with a record of his long life in wrinkles faithfully written no doubt but with such cramped chirography of father time that the purport was illegible it seemed hardly worth while for the patriarch to get out of bed any more and bring his forlorn shadow into the summer day that was made for younger folks the doctor however was by no means of that opinion being considerably encouraged towards the toil of living twenty four hours longer by the comparative ease with which he found himself going through the usually painful process of bestirring his rusty joints stiffened by the very rest and sleep that should have made them pliable and putting them in a condition to bear his weight upon the floor nor was he absolutely disheartened by the idea of those tonsorial ablutionary and personally decorative labors which are apt to become so intolerably irksome to an old gentleman after performing them daily and daily for fifty sixty or seventy years and finding them still as immitigably recurrent as at first dr dolliver could nowise account for this happy condition of his spirits and physical energies until he remembered taking an experimental sip of a certain cordial which was long ago prepared by his grandson and carefully sealed up in a bottle and had been reposited in a dark closet among a parcel of effete medicines ever since that gifted young man s death it may have wrought effect upon me thought the doctor shaking his head as he lifted it again from the pillow it may be so for poor edward oftentimes instilled a strange efficacy into his perilous drugs but i will rather believe it to be the operation of god s mercy which may have temporarily invigorated my feeble age for little pansie s sake a twinge of his familiar rheumatism as he put his foot out of bed taught him that he must not reckon too confidently upon even a day s respite from the intrusive family of aches and infirmities which with their proverbial fidelity to attachments once formed had long been the closest acquaintances that the poor old gentleman had in the world nevertheless he fancied the twinge a little less poignant than those of yesterday and moreover after stinging him pretty smartly it passed gradually off with a thrill which in its latter stages grew to be almost agreeable pain is but pleasure too strongly emphasized with cautious movements and only a groan or two the good doctor transferred himself from the bed to the floor where he stood awhile gazing from one piece of quaint furniture to another such as stiff backed mayflower chairs an oaken chest of drawers carved cunningly with shapes of animals and wreaths of foliage a table with multitudinous legs a family record in faded embroidery a shelf of black bound books a dirty heap of gallipots and phials in a dim corner gazing at these things and steadying himself by the bedpost while his inert brain still partially benumbed with sleep came slowly into accordance with the realities about him the object which most helped to bring dr dolliver completely to his waking perceptions was one that common observers might suppose to have been snatched bodily out of his dreams the same sunbeam that had dazzled the doctor between the bed curtains gleamed on the weather beaten gilding which had once adorned this mysterious symbol and showe

the young man s blood ran back from her at her acid tone but the mortification was physical only smiling quickly gently never he re echoed there was silence between them for some moments whilst louisa continued to play the piano for their benefit at last drat it she exclaimed flouncing round on the piano stool the two looked up at her ye did run well what hath hindered you laughed byrne you cried louisa oh i can t play any more she added dropping her arms along her skirt pathetically helena laughed quickly oh i can t helen pleaded louisa my dear said helena laughing briefly you are really under no obligation whatever with the little groan of one who yields to a desire contrary to her self respect louisa dropped at the feet of helena laid her arm and her head languishingly on the knee of her friend the latter gave no sign but continued to gaze in the fire byrne on the other side of the hearth sprawled in his chair smoking a reflective cigarette the room was very quiet silent even of the tick of a clock outside the traffic swept by and feet pattered along the pavement but this vulgar storm of life seemed shut out of helena s room that remained indifferent like a church two candles burned dimly as on an altar glistening yellow on the dark piano the lamp was blown out and the flameless fire a red rubble dwindled in the grate so that the yellow glow of the candles seemed to shine even on the embers still no one spoke at last helena shivered slightly in her chair though did not change her position she sat motionless will you make coffee louisa she asked louisa lifted herself looked at her friend and stretched slightly oh she groaned voluptuously this is so comfortable don t trouble then i ll go no don t get up said helena trying to disengage herself louisa reached and put her hands on helena s wrists i will go she drawled almost groaning with voluptuousness and appealing love then as helena still made movements to rise the elder woman got up slowly leaning as she did so all her weight on her friend where is the coffee she asked affecting the dullness of lethargy she was full of small affectations being consumed with uneasy love i think my dear replied helena it is in its usual place oh o o oh yawned louisa and she dragged herself out the two had been intimate friends for years had slept together and played together and lived together now the

any more than a tree can help budding in april it can t help itself if it s alive same with you well then and again there was the touch of a sneer if i can t help myself why trouble my friend because because i suppose i can t help myself if it bothers me it does you see i he smiled brilliantly am april she paid very little attention to him but began in a peculiar reedy metallic tone that set his nerves quivering but i am not a bare tree all my dead leaves they hang to me and and go through a kind of danse macabre but you bud underneath like beech he said quickly really my friend she said coldly i am too tired to bud no he pleaded no with his thick brows knitted he surveyed her anxiously she had received a great blow in august and she still was stunned her face white and heavy was like a mask almost sullen she looked in the fire forgetting him you want march he said he worried endlessly over her to rip off your old leaves i s ll have to be march he laughed she ignored him again because of his presumption he waited awhile then broke out once more you must start again you must always you rustle your red leaves of a blasted summer you are not dead even if you want to be you re not even if it s a bitter thing to say you have to say it you are not dead smiling a peculiar painful smile as if he hurt her she turned to gaze at a photograph that hung over the piano it was the profile of a handsome man in the prime of life he was leaning slightly forward as if yielding beneath a burden of life or to the pull of fate he looked out musingly and there was no hint of rebellion in the contours of the regular features the hair was brushed back soft and thick straight from his fine brow his nose was small and shapely his chin rounded cleft rather beautifully moulded byrne gazed also at the photo his look became distressed and helpless you cannot say you are dead with siegmund he cried brutally she shuddered clasped her burning arms on her breast and looked into the

own mother had told to her when she herself was younger than little ernest a story not of things that were past but of what was yet to come a story nevertheless so very old that even the indians who formerly inhabited this valley had heard it from their forefathers to whom as they affirmed it had been murmured by the mountain streams and whispered by the wind among the tree tops the purport was that at some future day a child should be born hereabouts who was destined to become the greatest and noblest personage of his time and whose countenance in manhood should bear an exact resemblance to the great stone face not a few old fashioned people and young ones likewise in the ardor of their hopes still cherished an enduring faith in this old prophecy but others who had seen more of the world had watched and waited till they were weary and had beheld no man with such a face nor any man that proved to be much greater or nobler than his neighbors concluded it to be nothing but an idle tale at all events the great man of the prophecy had not yet appeared o mother dear mother cried ernest clapping his hands above his head i do hope that i shall live to see him his mother was an affectionate and thoughtful woman and felt that it was wisest not to discourage the generous hopes of her little boy so she only said to him perhaps you may and ernest never forgot the story that his mother told him it was always in his mind whenever he looked upon the great stone face he spent his childhood in the log cottage where he was born and was dutiful to his mother and helpful to her in many things assisting her much with his little hands and more with his loving heart in this manner from a happy yet often pensive child he grew up to be a mild quiet unobtrusive boy and sun browned with labor in the fields but with more intelligence brightening his aspect than is seen in many lads who have been taught at famous schools yet ernest had had no teacher save only that the great stone face became one to him when the toil of the day was over he would gaze at it for hours until he began to imagine that those vast features recognized him and gave him a smile of kindness and encouragement responsive to his own look of veneration we must not take upon us to affirm that this was a mistake although the face may have looked no more kindly at ernest than at all the world besides but the secret was that the boy s tender and confiding simplicity discerned what other people could not see and thus the love which was meant for all became his peculiar portion about this time there went a rumor throughout the valley that the great man foretold from ages long ago who was to bear a resemblance to the great stone face had appeared at last it seems that many years before a young man had migrated from the valley and settled at a distant seaport where after getting together a little money he had set up as a shopkeeper his name but i could never learn whether it was his real one or a nickname that had grown out of his habits and success in life was gathergold being shrewd and active and endowed by providence with that inscrutable faculty which develops itself in what the world calls luck he became an exceedingly rich merchant and owner of a whole fleet of bulky bottomed ships all the countries of the globe appeared to join hands for the mere purpose of adding heap after heap to the mountainous accumulation of this one man s wealth the cold regions of the north almost within the gloom and shadow of the arctic circle sent him their tribute in the shape of furs hot africa sifted for him the golden sands of her rivers and gathered up the ivory tusks of her great elephants out of the forests the east came bringing him the rich shawls and spices and teas and the effulgence of diamonds and the gleaming purity of large pearls the ocean not to be behindhand with the earth yielded up her mighty whales that mr gathergold might sell their oil and make a profit on it be the original commodity what it might it was gold within his grasp it might be said of him as of midas in the fable that whatever he touched with his finger immediately glistened and grew yellow and was changed at once into sterling metal or which suited him still better into piles of coin and when mr gathergold had become so very rich that it would have taken him a hundred years only to count his wealth he bethought himself of his native valley and resolved to go back thither and end his days where he was born with this purpose in view he sent a skilful architect to build him such a palace as should be fit for a man of his vast wealth to live in as i have said above it had already been rumored in the valley that mr gathergold had turned out to be the prophetic personage so long and vainly looked for and that his visage was the perfect and undeniable similitude of the great stone face people were the more ready to believe that this must needs be the fact when they beheld the splendid edifice that rose as if by enchantment on the site of his father s old weather beaten farmhouse the exterior was of marble so dazzlingly white that it seemed as though the whole structure might melt away in the sunshine like those humbler ones which mr gathergold in his young play days before his fingers were gifted with the touch of transmutation had been accustomed to build of snow it had a richly ornamented portico supported by tall pillars beneath which was a lofty door studded with silver knobs and made of a kind of variegated wood that had been brought from beyond the sea the windows from the floor to the ceiling of each stately apartment were composed respectively of but one enormous pane of glass so transparently pure that it was said

sea and in others cool and secluded retreats in the valleys on the land it was in one of these villas that nero was born nero s father belonged to a family which had enjoyed for several generations a considerable degree of distinction among the roman nobility though known by a somewhat whimsical name the family name was brazenbeard or to speak more exactly it was ahenobarbus which is the latin equivalent for that word it is a question somewhat difficult to decide whether in speaking of nero s father at the present time and in the english tongue we should make use of the actual latin name or translate the word and employ the english representative of it that is whether we shall call him ahenobarbus or brazenbeard the former seems to be more in harmony with our ideas of the dignity of roman history while the latter though less elegant conveys probably to our minds a more exact idea of the import and expression of the name as it sounded in the ears of the roman community the name certainly was not an attractive one though the family had contrived to dignify it some degree by assigning to it a preternatural origin there was a tradition that in ancient times a prophet appeared to one of the ancestors of the line and after foretelling certain extraordinary events which were to occur at some future period stroked down the beard of his auditor with his hand and changed it to the color of brass in miraculous attestation of the divine authority of the message the man received the name of brazenbeard in consequence and he and his descendants ever afterward retained it the family of the brazenbeards was one of high rank and distinction though at the time of nero s birth it was like most of the other prominent roman families extremely profligate and corrupt nero s father especially was a very bad man he was accused of the very worst of crimes and he led a life of constant remorse and terror his wife agrippina nero s mother was as wicked as he and it is said that when the messenger came to him to announce the birth of his child the hero of this narrative he uttered some exclamation of ill humor and contempt and said that whatever came from him and agrippina could not but be fraught with ruin to rome the rank and station of agrippina in roman society was even higher than that of her husband she was the sister of the emperor the name of the emperor her brother was caligula he was the third in the series of roman emperors augustus c sar the successor of julius c sar having been the first the term emperor however had a very different meaning in those days from its present import it seems to denote now a sovereign ruler who exercises officially a general jurisdiction which extends over the whole government of the state in the days of the romans it included in theory at least only military command the word was imperator which meant commander and the station which it denoted was simply that of general in chief over the military forces of the republic in the early periods of the roman history every possible precaution was taken to keep the military power in a condition of very strict subordination to the authority of the civil magistrate and of law very stringent regulations were adopted to secure this end no portion of the army except such small detachments as were required for preserving order within the walls was allowed to approach the city great commanders in returning from their victorious campaigns were obliged to halt and encamp at some distance from the gates and there await the orders of the roman senate the senate was in theory the great repository of political power this senate was not however as the word might seem in modern times to denote a well defined and compact body of legislators designated individually to the office but rather a class of hereditary nobles very numerous and deriving their power from immemorial usage and from that strange and unaccountable feeling of deference and awe with which the mass of mankind always look up to an established and especially an ancient aristocracy the senate were accustomed to convene at stated times in assemblages which were sometimes conducted with a proper degree of formality and order and sometimes on the other hand exhibited scenes of great tumult and confusion their power however whether regularly or irregularly exercised was supreme they issued edicts they enacted laws they allotted provinces they made peace and they declared war the armies and the generals who commanded them were the agents employed to do their bidding the roman armies consisted of vast bodies of men which when not in actual service were established in permanent encampments in various parts of the empire wherever it was deemed necessary that troops should be stationed these great bodies of troops were the celebrated roman legions and they were renowned throughout the world for their discipline their admirable organization the celerity of their movements and for the indomitable courage and energy of the men each legion constituted in fact a separate and independent community its camp was its city its general was its king in time of war it moved of course from place to place as the exigencies of the service required but in time of peace it established itself with great formality in a spacious and permanent encampment which was laid out with great regularity and fortified with ramparts and fosses within the confines of the camp the tents were arranged in rows with broad spaces for streets between them and in a central position before a space which served the purpose of a public square the rich and ornamented pavilions of the commander and chief and of the other generals rose above the rest like the public edifices of a city the

lived every night just before going to bed johnny chuck would sit on his door step just to listen and as he listened somehow he felt better and happier and he always had pleasant dreams after listening to the sweet singers of the smiling pool even after he had curled himself up for the night deep down in his snug bedroom he could hear those sweet voices and whenever he waked up in the night he would hear them spring spring spring spring beautiful beautiful beautiful spring so gentle so loving so sweet and so fair oh who can be cross when there s love in the air be happy be joyful and join in our song and help us to send the glad tidings along spring spring spring spring beautiful beautiful beautiful spring when johnny chuck had first heard them he had looked in all the tree tops for the singers but not one could he see then he had thought that they must be hidden in the bushes but when he went to look he found that the sweet singers were not there it was very mysterious finally he asked peter rabbit if he knew who the sweet singers were and where they were peter didn t know but he was willing to try to find out peter is always willing to try to find out about things he doesn t already know about so johnny chuck and peter rabbit started out to find the sweet singers i believe they are down in the old bulrushes around the smiling pool said peter rabbit as he stood listening with a hand behind one long ear so over to the smiling pool they hurried the nearer they got the louder became the voices singing spring spring spring spring beautiful beautiful beautiful spring but look as they would they couldn t see a single singer among the brown bulrushes it was very strange very strange indeed it seemed as if the voices came right out of the smiling pool itself when peter rabbit made a little noise as he hopped out on the bank where he could look all over the smiling pool the singing stopped after he had sat perfectly still for a little while it began again there was no doubt about it this time those voices came right out of the water johnny chuck stared at peter rabbit and peter stared at johnny chuck nobody was to be seen in the smiling pool and yet

saw now with a brown gloved hand and regarding her with his inscrutable blue glasses leave the hat he said speaking very distinctly through the white cloth her nerves began to recover from the shock they had received she placed the hat on the chair again by the fire i didn t know sir she began that and she stopped embarrassed thank you he said drily glancing from her to the door and then at her again i ll have them nicely dried sir at once she said and carried his clothes out of the room she glanced at his white swathed head and blue goggles again as she was going out of the door but his napkin was still in front of his face she shivered a little as she closed the door behind her and her face was eloquent of her surprise and perplexity i never she whispered there she went quite softly to the kitchen and was too preoccupied to ask millie what she was messing about with now when she got there the visitor sat and listened to her retreating feet he glanced inquiringly at the window before he removed his serviette and resumed his meal he took a mouthful glanced suspiciously at the window took another mouthful then rose and taking the serviette in his hand walked across the room and pulled the blind down to the top of the white muslin that obscured the lower panes this left the room in a twilight this done he returned with an easier air to the table and his meal the poor soul

clear away the stranger s lunch her idea that his mouth must also have been cut or disfigured in the accident she supposed him to have suffered was confirmed for he was smoking a pipe and all the time that she was in the room he never loosened the silk muffler he had wrapped round the lower part of his face to put the mouthpiece to his lips yet it was not forgetfulness for she saw he glanced at it

reflection of the fire lent a kind of red animation to his big spectacles they had lacked hitherto i have some luggage he said at bramblehurst station and he asked her how he could have it sent he bowed his bandaged head quite politely in acknowledgment of her explanation to morrow he said there is no speedier delivery and seemed quite disappointed when she answered no was she quite sure no man

gasped at him for a moment and remembered the two sovereigns she went for the matches thanks he said concisely as she put them down and turned his shoulder upon her and stared out of the window again it was altogether too discouraging evidently he was sensitive on the topic of operations and bandages she did not make so bold as to say however after all but his snubbing way had irritated her and

you won t be in quite such a hurry to tell lies about me another time though i suppose that one must always expect a certain amount of lying from a half bred beggar like you like mother like son you know this last sentence was accompanied by a bitter laugh and produced a decided effect on the grovelling george who slowly raised himself upon his hands and lifting his head looked his cousin full in the face it was not the ghastly appearance of his mangled and blood soaked countenance that made philip recoil so sharply from the sight of his own handiwork he had fought too often at school to be chicken hearted about a little bloodshed and besides he knew that his cousin was only knocked about not really injured but rather the intense and almost devilish malignity of the expression that hovered on the blurred features and in the half closed eyes but no attempt was made by george to translate the look into words and indeed philip felt that it was untranslatable he also felt dimly that the hate and malice with which he was regarded by the individual at his feet was of a more concentrated and enduring character than most men have the power to originate in the lurid light of that one glance he was able though he was not very clever to pierce the darkest recesses of his cousin s heart and to see his inmost thought no longer through a veil but face to face and what he saw was sufficient to make the blood leave his ruddy cheek and to fix his eyes into an expression of fear next second george dropped his head on to the ground again and began to moan in an ostentatious manner possibly in order to attract some one whose footsteps could be plainly heard proceeding slowly down a shrubbery path on the other side of the yard wall at any rate that was the effect produced for next moment before philip could think of escape had he wished to escape a door in the wall was opened and a gentleman pausing on the threshold surveyed the whole scene with the assistance of a gold mounted eye glass with some evident surprise and little apparent satisfaction the old gentleman for he was old made so pretty a picture framed as he was in the arched doorway and set off by a natural background of varying shades of green that his general appearance is worth sketching as he stood to begin with he was dressed in the fashion of the commencement of this century and as has been said old though it was difficult to say how old indeed so vigorous and comparatively youthful was his bearing that he was generally taken to be considerably under seventy but as a matter of fact he was but a few years short of eighty he was extremely tall over six feet and stood upright as a lifeguardsman indeed his height and stately carriage would alone have made him a remarkable looking man had there been nothing else unusual about him but as it happened his features were as uncommon as his person they were clear cut and cast in a noble mould the nose was large and aquiline the chin like his son philip s square and determined but it was his eyes that gave a painful fascination to his countenance they were steely blue and glittered under the pent house of his thick eyebrows that in striking contrast to the snow white of his hair were black in hue as tempered steel glitters in a curtained room it was those eyes in conjunction with sundry little peculiarities of temper that had earned for the old man the title of devil caresfoot a sobriquet in which he took peculiar pride so pleased was he with it indeed that he caused it to be engraved in solid oak letters an inch long upon the form of a life sized and life like portrait of himself that hung over the staircase in the house i am determined he would say to his son to be known to my posterity as i was known to my contemporaries the picture represents my person not inaccurately from the nickname my descendants will be able to gather what the knaves and fools with whom i lived thought of my character ah boy i am wearing out people will soon be staring at that portrait and wondering if it was like me in a very few years i shall no longer be devil but devilled and he would chuckle at his grim and ill omened joke philip felt his father s eyes playing upon him and shrunk from them his face had at the mere thought of the consequences of his chastisement of his cousin lost the beauty and animation that had clothed it a minute before now it grew leaden and hard the good died away from it altogether and instead of a young god bright with vengeance there was nothing but a sullen youth with dull and frightened eyes to his son as to most people who came under his influence devil caresfoot was a grave reality presently the picture in the doorway opened its mouth and spoke in a singularly measured gentle voice you will forgive me philip for interrupting your tete a tete but may i ask what is the meaning of this philip returned no answer since your cousin is not in a communicative mood george perhaps you will inform me why you are lying on your face and groaning in that unpleasant and aggressive manner george lifted his blood stained face from the stones and looking at his uncle groaned louder than ever may i ask you philip if george has fallen down and hurt himself or if there has been an an altercation between you here george himself got up and before philip could make any reply addressed himself to his uncle sir he said i will answer for philip there has been an altercation and he in the scuffle knocked me down and i confess here he put his hand up to his battered face that i am suffering a good

which his own nature has given against him in this matter of hunting and he gets into his early tub with acme glow of satisfaction and afterwards it is nice to find himself bright with mahogany tops buff tinted breeches and a pink coat the ordinary habiliments of an english gentleman are so sombre that his own eye is gratified and he feels that he has placed himself in the vanguard of society by thus shining in his apparel and he will ride this year he is fixed to that purpose he will ride straight and if possible he will like it but the ethiop cannot change his skin nor can any man add a cubit to his stature he doesn t like it and all around him in the field know how it is with him he himself knows how it is with others like himself and he congregates with his brethren the period of his penance has come upon him he has to pay the price of those pleasant interviews with his tradesmen he has to expiate the false boasts made to his female cousins that row of boots cannot be made to shine in his chamber for nothing the hounds have found and the fox is away men are fastening on their flat topped hats and feeling themselves in their stirrups horses are hot for the run and the moment for liking it has come if only it were possible but at moments such as these something has to be done the man who doesn t like it let him dislike it ever so much cannot check his horse and simply ride back to the hunting stables he understands that were he to do that he must throw up his cap at once and resign nor can he trot easily along the roads with the fat old country gentleman who is out on his rough cob and who looking up to the wind and remembering the position of adjacent coverts will give a good guess as to the direction in which the field will move no he must make an effort the time of his penance has come and the penance must be borne there is a spark of pluck about him though unfortunately he has brought it to bear in a wrong direction the blood still runs at his heart and he resolves that he will ride if only he could tell which way the stout gentleman on the cob has taken the road to the left with a few companions but our friend knows that the stout gentleman has a little game of his own which will not be suitable for one who intends to ride then the crowd in front has divided itself those to the right rush down a hill towards a brook with a ford one or two men whom he hates with an intensity of envy have jumped the brook and have settled to their work twenty or thirty others are hustling themselves through the water the time for a judicious start on that side is already gone but others a crowd of others are facing the big ploughed field immediately before them that is the straightest riding and with them he goes why has the scent lain so hot over the up turned heavy ground why do they go so fast at this the very first blush of the morning fortune is always against him and the horse is pulling him through the mud as though the brute meant to drag his arm out of the socket at the first fence as he is steadying himself a butcher passes him roughly in the jump and nearly takes away the side of his top boot he is knocked half out of his saddle and in that condition scrambles through when he has regained his equilibrium he sees the happy butcher going into the field beyond he means to curse the butcher when he catches him but the butcher is safe a field and a half before him he still sees the tail hounds and renews his effort he has meant to like it to day and he will so he rides at the next fence boldly where the butcher has left his mark and does it pretty well with a slight struggle why is it that he can never get over a ditch without some struggle in his saddle some scramble with his horse why does he curse the poor animal so constantly unless it be that he cannot catch the butcher now he rushes at a gate which others have opened for him but rushes too late and catches his leg mad with pain he nearly gives it up but the spark of pluck is still there and with throbbing knee he perseveres how he hates it it is all detestable now he cannot hold his horse because of his gloves and he cannot get them off the sympathetic beast knows that his master is unhappy and makes himself unhappy and troublesome in consequence our friend is still going riding wildly but still keeping a grain of caution for his fences he has not been down yet but has barely saved himself more than once the ploughs are very deep and his horse though still boring at him pants heavily oh that there might come a check or that the brute of a fox might happily go to ground but no the ruck of the hunt is far away from him in front and the game is running steadily straight for some well known though still distant protection but the man who doesn t like it still sees a red coat before him and perseveres in chasing the wearer of it the solitary red coat becomes distant and still more distant from him but he goes on while he can yet keep the line in which that red coat has ridden he must hurry himself however or he will be lost to humanity and will be alone he must hurry himself but his horse now desires to hurry no more so he puts his spurs to the brute savagely and then at some little fence some ignoble ditch they come down together in the mud and the question of any further effort is saved for the rider when he arises the red coat is out of sight and his own horse is half across the field before him in such a position is it possible that a man should like it about four o clock in the afternoon when the other men are coming in he turns up at the hunting stables and nobody asks him any questions he may have been doing fairly well for what anybody knows and as he says nothing of himself his d

featherbed that wouldn t do nothin but sag round in a pig headed sort of way that would have made most girls get mad and give up kitty didn t but just wrastled with it like a good one till she got it turned banged and spread to suit her then she plumped down in the middle of it with a sarcy little nod and chuckle to herself that tickled me mightily plucky thinks i better n better jest then an old

courtesy in the way of sight showing perhaps he will choose to take a nearer view of the memorable spot we stand now on the river s brink it may well be called the concord the river of peace and quietness for it is certainly the most unexcitable and sluggish stream that ever loitered imperceptibly towards its eternity the sea positively i had lived three weeks beside it before it grew quite clear to my perception which way the current flowed it never has a vivacious aspect except when a northwestern breeze is vexing its surface on a sunshiny day from the incurable indolence of its nature the stream is happily incapable of becoming the slave of human ingenuity as is the fate of so many a wild free mountain torrent while all things else are compelled to subserve some useful purpose it idles its sluggish life away in lazy liberty without turning a solitary spindle or affording even water power enough to grind the corn that grows upon its banks the torpor of its movement allows it nowhere a bright pebbly shore nor so much as a narrow strip of glistening sand in any part of its course it slumbers between broad prairies kissing the long meadow grass and bathes the overhanging boughs of elder bushes and willows or the roots of elms and ash trees and clumps of maples flags and rushes grow along its plashy shore the yellow water lily spreads its broad flat leaves on the margin and the fragrant white pond lily abounds generally selecting a position just so far from the river s brink that it cannot be grasped save at the hazard of plunging in it is a marvel whence this perfect flower derives its loveliness and perfume springing as it does from the black mud over which the river sleeps and where lurk the slimy eel and speckled frog and the mud turtle whom continual washing cannot cleanse it is the very same black mud out of which the yellow lily sucks its obscene life and noisome odor thus we see too in the world that some persons assimilate only what is ugly and evil from the same moral circumstances which supply good and beautiful results the fragrance of celestial flowers to the daily life of others the reader must not from any testimony of mine contract a dislike towards our slumberous stream in the light of a calm and golden sunset it becomes lovely beyond expression the more lovely for the quietude that so well accords with the hour when even the wind after blustering all day long usually hushes itself to rest each tree and rock and every blade of grass is distinctly imaged and however unsightly in reality assumes ideal beauty in the reflection the minutest things of earth and the broad aspect of the firmament are pictured equally without effort and with the same felicity of success all the sky glows downward at our feet the rich clouds float through the unruffled bosom of the stream like heavenly thoughts through a peaceful heart we will not then malign our river as gross and impure while it can glorify itself with so adequate a picture of the heaven that broods above it or if we remember its tawny hue and the muddiness of its bed let it be a symbol that the earthiest human soul has an infinite spiritual capacity and may contain the better world within its depths but indeed the same lesson might be drawn out of any mud puddle in the streets of a city and being taught us everywhere it must be true come we have pursued a somewhat devious track in our walk to the battle ground here we are at the point where the river was crossed by the old bridge the possession of which was the immediate object of the contest on the hither side grow two or three elms throwing a wide circumference of shade but which must have been planted at some period within the threescore years and ten that have passed since the battle day on the farther shore overhung by a clump of elder bushes we discern the stone abutment of the bridge looking down into the river i once discovered some heavy fragments of the timbers all green with half a century s growth of water moss for during that length of time the tramp of horses and human footsteps have ceased along this ancient highway the stream has here about the breadth of twenty strokes of a swimmer s arm a space not too wide when the bullets were whistling across old people who dwell hereabouts will point out the very spots on the western bank where our countrymen fell down and died and on this side of the river an obelisk of granite has grown up from the soil that was fertilized with british blood the monument not more than twenty feet in height is such as it befitted the inhabitants of a village to erect in illustration of a matter of local interest rather than what was suitable to commemorate an epoch of national history still by the fathers of the village this famous deed was done and their descendants might rightfully claim the privilege of building a memorial a humbler token of the fight yet a more interesting one than the granite obelisk may be seen close under the stone wall which separates the battle ground from the precincts of the parsonage it is the grave marked by a small mossgrown fragment of stone at the head and another at the foot the grave of two british soldiers who were slain in the skirmish and have ever since slept peacefully where zechariah brown and thomas davis buried them soon was their warfare ended a weary night march from boston a rattling volley of musketry across the river and then these many years of rest in the long procession of slain invaders who passed into eternity from the battle fields of the revolution

poeta but now these things are looked on with little wonder and to be conscious of them with intense delight is esteemed to be the distinguishing mark of a refined and extraordinary person the multitude of men care not for them it is thus with life that which includes all what is life thoughts and feelings arise with or without our will and we employ words to express them we are born and our birth is unremembered and our infancy remembered but in fragments we live on and in living we lose the apprehension of life how vain is it to think that words can penetrate the mystery of our being rightly used they may make evident our ignorance to ourselves and this is much for what are we whence do we come and whither do we go is birth the commencement is death the conclusion of our being what is birth and death the most refined abstractions of logic conduct to a view of life which though startling to the apprehension is in fact that which the habitual sense of its repeated combinations has extinguished in us it strips as it were the painted curtain from this scene of things i confess that i am one of those who are unable to refuse my assent to the conclusions of those philosophers who assert that nothing exists but as it is perceived it is a decision against which all our persuasions struggle and we must be long convicted before we can be convinced that the solid universe of external things is such stuff as dreams are made of the shocking absurdities of the popular philosophy of mind and matter its fatal consequences in morals and their violent dogmatism concerning the source of all things had early conducted me to materialism this materialism is a seducing system to young and superficial minds it allows its disciples to talk and dispenses them from thinking but i was discontented with such a view of things as it afforded man is a being of high aspirations looking both before and after whose thoughts wander through eternity disclaiming alliance with transience and decay incapable of imagining to himself annihilation existing but in the future and the past being not what he is but what he has been and shall be whatever may be his true and final destination there is a spirit within him at enmity with nothingness and dissolution this is the character of all life and being each is at once the centre and the circumference the point to which all things are referred and the line in which all things are contained such contemplations as these materialism and the popular philosophy of mind and matter alike forbid they are only consistent with the intellectual system it is absurd to enter into a long recapitulation of arguments sufficiently familiar to those inquiring minds whom alone a writer on abstruse subjects can be conceived to address perhaps the most clear and vigorous statement of the intellectual system is to be found in sir william drummond s academical questions after such an exposition it would be idle to translate into other words what could only lose its energy and fitness by the change examined point by point and word by word the most discriminating intellects have been able to discern no train of thoughts in the process of reasoning which does not conduct inevitably to the conclusion which has been stated what follows from the admission it establishes no new truth it gives us no additional insight into our hidden nature neither its action nor itself philosophy impatient as it may be to build has much work yet remaining as pioneer for the overgrowth of ages it makes one step towards this object it destroys error and the roots of error it leaves what it is too often the duty of the reformer in political and ethical questions to leave a vacancy it reduces the mind to that freedom in which it would have acted but for the misuse of words and signs the instruments of its own creation by signs i would be understood in a wide sense including what is properly meant by that term and what i peculiarly mean in this latter sense almost all familiar objects are signs standing not for themselves but for others in their capacity of suggesting one thought which shall lead to a train of thoughts our whole life is thus an education of error let us recollect our sensations as children what a distinct and intense apprehension had we of the world and of ourselves many of the circumstances of social life were then important to us which are now no longer so but that is not the point of comparison on which i mean to insist we less habitually distinguished all that we saw and felt from ourselves they seemed as it were to constitute one mass there are some persons who in this respect are always children those who are subject to the state called reverie feel as if their nature were dissolved into the surrounding universe or as if the surrounding universe were absorbed into their being they are conscious of no distinction and these are states which precede or accompany or follow an unusually intense and vivid apprehension of life as men grow up this power commonly decays and they become mechanical and habitual agents thus feelings and then reasonings are the combined result of a multitude of entangled thoughts and of a series of what are called impressions planted by reiteration the view of life presented by the most refined deductions of the intellectual philosophy is that of unity nothing exists but as

young frank gresham found himself member for east barsetshire although the very men who elected him knew that they had but slender ground for trusting him with their suffrages frank gresham though then only twenty four years of age was a married man and a father he had already chosen a wife and by his choice had given much ground of distrust to the men of east barsetshire he had married no other than lady arabella de courcy the sister of the great whig earl who lived at courcy castle in the west that earl who not only voted for the reform bill but had been infamously active in bringing over other young peers so to vote and whose name therefore stank in the nostrils of the staunch tory squires of the county not only had frank gresham so wedded but having thus improperly and unpatriotically chosen a wife he had added to his sins by becoming recklessly intimate with his wife s relations it is true that he still called himself a tory belonged to the club of which his father had been one of the most honoured members and in the days of the great battle got his head broken in a row on the right side but nevertheless it was felt by the good men true and blue of east barsetshire that a constant sojourner at courcy castle could not be regarded as a consistent tory when however his father died that broken head served him in good stead his sufferings in the cause were made the most of these in unison with his father s merits turned the scale and it was accordingly decided at a meeting held at the george and dragon at barchester that frank gresham should fill his father s shoes but frank gresham could not fill his father s shoes they were too big for him he did become member for east barsetshire but he was such a member so lukewarm so indifferent so prone to associate with the enemies of the good cause so little willing to fight the good fight that he soon disgusted those who most dearly loved the memory of the old squire de courcy castle in those days had great allurements for a young man and all those allurements were made the most of to win over young gresham his wife who was a year or two older than himself was a fashionable woman with thorough whig tastes and aspirations such as became the daughter of a great whig earl she cared for politics or thought that she cared for them more than her husband did for a month or two previous to her engagement she had been attached to the court and had been made to believe that much of the policy of england s rulers depended on the political intrigues of england s women she was one who would fain be doing something if she only knew how and the first important attempt she made was to turn her respectable young tory husband into a second rate whig bantling as this lady s character will it is hoped show itself in the following pages we need not now describe it more closely it is not a bad thing to be son in law to a potent earl member of parliament for a county and a possessor of a fine old english seat and a fine old english fortune as a very young man frank gresham found the life to which he was thus introduced agreeable enough he consoled himself as best he might for the blue looks with which he was greeted by his own party and took his revenge by consorting more thoroughly than ever with his political adversaries foolishly like a foolish moth he flew to the bright light and like the moths of course he burnt his wings early in he had become a member of parliament and in the autumn of the dissolution came young members of three or four and twenty do not think much of dissolutions forget the fancies of their constituents and are too proud of the present to calculate much as to the future so it was with mr gresham his father had been member for barsetshire all his life and he looked forward to similar prosperity as though it were part of his inheritance but he failed to take any of the steps which had secured his father s seat in the autumn of the dissolution came and frank gresham with his honourable lady wife and all the de courcys at his back found that he had mortally offended the county to his great disgust another candidate was brought forward as a fellow to his late colleague and though he manfully fought the battle and spent ten thousand pounds in the contest he could not recover his position a high tory with a great whig interest to back him is never a popular person in england no one can trust him though there may be those who are willing to place him untrusted in high positions such was the case with mr gresham there were many who were willing for family considerations to keep him in parliament but no one thought that he was fit to be there the consequences were that a bitter and expensive contest ensued frank gresham when twitted with being a whig foreswore the de courcy family and then when ridiculed as having been thrown over by the tories foreswore his father s old friends so between the two stools he fell to the ground and as a politician he never again rose to his feet he never again rose to his feet but twice again he made violent efforts to do so elections in east barsetshire from various causes came quick upon each other in those days and before he was eight and twenty years of age mr gresham had three times contested the county and been three times beaten to speak the truth of him his own spirit would have been satisfied with the loss of the first ten thousand pounds but lady arabella was made of higher mettle she had married a man with a fine place and a fine fortune but she had nevertheless married a

unearthly shout close at hand then died away by slow gradations as if the accursed being that uttered it had withdrawn over the verge of the world whence it had come but the man felt that this was not so that it was near by and had not moved a strange sensation began slowly to take possession of his body and his mind he could not have said which if any of his senses was affected he felt it rather as a consciousness a mysterious mental assurance of some overpowering presence some supernatural malevolence different in kind from the invisible existences that swarmed about him and superior to them in power he knew that it had uttered that hideous laugh and now it seemed to be approaching him from what direction he did not know dared not conjecture all his former fears were forgotten or merged in the gigantic terror that now held him in thrall apart from that he had but one thought to complete his written appeal to the benign powers who traversing the haunted wood might some time rescue him if he should be denied the blessing of annihilation he wrote with terrible rapidity the twig in his fingers rilling blood without renewal but in the middle of a sentence his hands denied their service

survived the wreck wrought by civil war their children had the social and educational opportunities of their time and place and had responded to good associations and instruction with agreeable manners and cultivated minds halpin being the youngest and not over robust was perhaps a trifle spoiled he had the double disadvantage of a mother s assiduity and a father s neglect frayser pere was what no southern man of means is not a politician his country or rather his section and state made demands upon his time and attention so exacting that to those of his family he was compelled to turn an ear partly deafened by the thunder of the political captains and the shouting his own included young halpin was of a dreamy indolent and rather romantic turn somewhat more addicted to literature than law the profession to which he was bred among those of his relations who professed the modern faith of heredity it was well understood that in him the character of the late myron bayne a maternal great grandfather had revisited the glimpses of the moon by which orb bayne had in his lifetime been sufficiently affected to be a poet of no small colonial distinction if not specially observed it was observable that while a frayser who was not the proud possessor of a sumptuous copy of the ancestral poetical works printed at the family expense and long ago withdrawn from an inhospitable market was a rare frayser indeed there was an illogical indisposition to honor the great deceased in the person of his spiritual successor halpin was pretty generally deprecated as an intellectual black sheep who was likely at any moment to disgrace the flock by bleating in meter the tennessee fraysers were a practical folk not practical in the popular sense of devotion to sordid pursuits but having a robust contempt for any qualities unfitting a man for the wholesome vocation of politics in justice to young halpin it should be said that while in him were pretty faithfully reproduced most of the mental and moral characteristics ascribed by history and family tradition to the famous colonial bard his succession to the gift and faculty divine was purely inferential not only had he never been known to court the muse but in truth he could not have written correctly a line of verse to save himself from the killer of the wise still there was no knowing when the dormant faculty might wake and

out of the gray of the morning and right ahead as we sailed along a dark object rose out of the sea standing dimly before us mists wreathing and curling aloft and creamy breakers frothing round its base we turned aside and at length when day dawned passed massafuero with a glass we spied two or three hermit goats winding down to the sea in a ravine and presently a signal a tattered flag upon a summit beyond well knowing however that there was nobody on the island but two or three noose fulls of runaway convicts from chili our captain had no mind to comply with their invitation to land though haply he may have erred in not sending a boat off with his card a few days more and we took the trades like favors snappishly conferred they came to us as is often the case in a very sharp squall the shock of which carried away one of our spars also our fat old cook off his legs depositing him plump in the scuppers to leeward in good time making the desired longitude upon the equator a few leagues west of the gallipagos we spent several weeks chassezing across the line to and fro in unavailing search for our prey for some of their hunters believe that whales like the silver ore in peru run in veins through the ocean so day after day daily and week after week weekly we traversed the self same longitudinal intersection of the self same line till we were almost ready to swear that we felt the ship strike every time her keel crossed that imaginary locality at length dead before the equatorial breeze we threaded our way straight along the very line itself westward sailing peering right and peering left but seeing naught it was during this weary time that i experienced the first symptoms of that bitter impatience of our monotonous craft which ultimately led to the adventures herein recounted but hold you not a word against that rare old ship nor its crew the sailors were good fellows all the half score of pagans we had shipped at the islands included nevertheless they were not precisely to my mind there was no soul a magnet to mine none with whom to mingle sympathies save in deploring the calms with which we were now and then overtaken or in hailing the breeze when it came under other and livelier auspices the tarry knaves might have developed qualities more attractive had we sprung a leak been stove by a whale or been blessed with some despot of a captain against whom to stir up some spirited revolt these shipmates of mine might have proved limber lads and men of mettle but as it was there was naught to strike fire from their steel there were other things also tending to make my lot on ship board very hard to be borne true the skipper himself was a trump stood upon no quarter deck dignity and had a tongue for a sailor let me do him justice furthermore he took a sort of fancy for me in particular was sociable nay loquacious when i happened to stand at the helm but what of that could he talk sentiment or philosophy not a bit his library was eight inches by four bowditch and hamilton moore and what to me thus pining for some one who could page me a quotation from burton on blue devils what to me indeed were flat repetitions of long drawn yams and the everlasting stanzas of black eyed susan sung by our full forecastle choir staler than stale ale ay ay arcturion i say it in no malice but thou wast exceedingly dull not only at sailing hard though it was that i could have borne but in every other respect the days went slowly round and round endless and uneventful as cycles in space time and time pieces how many centuries did

now to the broiling coast of papua that region of sun strokes typhoons and bitter pulls after whales unattainable far worse we were going it seemed to illustrate the whistonian theory concerning the damned and the comets hurried from equinoctial heats to arctic frosts to be short with the true fickleness of his tribe our skipper had abandoned all thought of the cachalot in desperation he was bent upon bobbing for the right whale on the nor west coast and in the bay of kamschatska to the uninitiated in the business of whaling my feelings at this juncture may perhaps be hard to understand but this much let me say that right whaling on the nor west coast in chill and dismal fogs the sullen inert monsters rafting the sea all round like hartz forest logs on the rhine and submitting to the

macgregor claimed a descent from gregor or gregorius third son it is said of alpin king of scots who flourished about hence their original patronymic is macalpine and they are usually termed the clan alpine an individual tribe of them retains the same name they are accounted one of the most ancient clans in the highlands and it is certain they were a people of original celtic descent and occupied at one period very extensive possessions in perthshire and argyleshire which they imprudently continued to hold by the coir a glaive that is the right of the sword their neighbours the earls of argyle and breadalbane in the meanwhile managed to leave the lands occupied by the macgregors engrossed in those charters which they easily obtained from the crown and thus constituted a legal right in their own favour without much regard to its justice as opportunity occurred of annoying or extirpating their neighbours they gradually extended their own domains by usurping under the pretext of such royal

pleasure to wear such a head gear is said to have been peculiarly successful in those acts of spoliation upon the clan macgregor the devoted sept ever finding themselves iniquitously driven from their possessions defended themselves by force and occasionally gained advantages which they used cruelly enough this conduct though natural considering the country and time was studiously represented at the capital as arising from an untameable and innate ferocity which nothing it was said could remedy save cutting off the tribe of macgregor root and branch in an act of privy council at stirling d

like powers to sir john campbell of glenorchy the descendant of duncan with the cowl but discharges the lieges to receive or assist any of the clan gregor or afford them under any colour whatever meat drink or clothes an atrocity which the clan gregor committed in by the murder of john drummond of drummond ernoch a forester of the royal forest of glenartney is elsewhere given with all its horrid circumstances the clan swore upon the severed head of the murdered man that they would make common cause in avowing the deed this led to an act of the privy council directing another crusade against the wicked clan gregor so long continuing in blood slaughter theft and robbery in which letters of fire and sword are denounced against them for the space of three years the reader will find this particular fact illustrated in the introduction to the legend of montrose in the present edition of these novels other occasions frequently occurred in which the macgregors testified contempt for the laws from which they had often experienced severity but never protection though they were gradually deprived of their possessions and of all ordinary means of procuring subsistence they could not nevertheless be supposed likely to starve for famine while they had the means of taking from strangers what they considered as rightfully their own hence they became versed in predatory forays and accustomed to bloodshed their passions were eager and with a little management on the part of some of their most powerful neighbours they could easily be hounded out to use an expressive scottish phrase to commit violence of which the wily instigators took the advantage and left the ignorant macgregors an undivided portion of blame and punishment this policy of pushing on the fierce clans of the highlands and borders to break the peace of the country is accounted by the historian one of the most dangerous practices of his own period in which the macgregors were considered as ready agents

to exercise much authority by the coir a glaive or right of the strongest which we have already mentioned there had been a long and bloody feud betwixt the macgregors and the laird of luss head of the family of colquhoun a powerful race on the lower part of loch lomond the macgregors tradition affirms that the quarrel began on a very trifling subject two of the macgregors being benighted asked shelter in a house belonging to a dependant of the colquhouns and were refused they then retreated to an out house took a wedder from the fold killed it and supped off the carcass for which it is said they offered payment to the proprietor the laird of luss seized on the offenders and by the summary process which feudal barons had at their command had them both condemned and executed the macgregors

again into the lists he is sure to be judged with severity proportioned to the former favour of the public if he be daunted by a bad reception on this second occasion he may again become a stranger to the arena if on the contrary he can keep his ground and stand the shuttlecock s fate of being struck up and down he will probably at length hold with some certainty the level in public opinion which he may be found to deserve and he may perhaps boast of arresting the general attention in the same manner as the bachelor samson carrasco of fixing the weathercock la giralda of seville for weeks months or years that is for as long as the wind shall uniformly blow from one quarter to this degree of popularity the author had the hardihood to aspire while in order to attain it he assumed the daring resolution to keep himself in the view of the public by frequent appearances before them it must be added that the author s incognito gave him greater courage to renew his attempts to please the public and an advantage similar to that which jack the giant killer received from his coat of darkness in sending the abbot forth so soon after the monastery he had used the well known practice recommended by bassanio in my school days when i had lost one shaft i shot another of the self same flight the self same way with more advised watch to find the other forth and to continue the simile his shafts like those of the lesser ajax were discharged more readily that the archer was as inaccessible to criticism personally speaking as the grecian archer under his brother s sevenfold shield should the reader desire to know upon what principles the abbot was expected to amend the fortune of the monastery i have first to request his attention to the introductory epistle addressed to the imaginary captain clutterbuck a mode by which like his predecessors in this walk of fiction the real author makes one of his dramatis personae the means of communicating his own sentiments to the public somewhat more artificially than by a direct address to the readers a pleasing french writer of fairy tales monsieur pajon author of the history of prince soly has set a diverting example of the same machinery where he introduces the presiding genius of the land of romance conversing with one of the personages of the tale in this introductory epistle the author communicates in confidence to captain clutterbuck his sense that the white lady had not met the taste of the times and his reason for withdrawing her from the scene the author did not deem it equally necessary to be candid respecting another alteration the monastery was designed at first to have contained some supernatural agency arising out of the fact that melrose had been the place of deposit of the great robert bruce s heart the writer shrunk however from filling up in this particular the sketch as it was originally traced nor did he venture to resume in continuation the subject which he had left unattempted in the original work thus the incident of the discovery of the heart which occupies the greater part of the introduction to the monastery is a mystery unnecessarily introduced and which remains at last very imperfectly explained in this particular i was happy to shroud myself by the example of the author of caleb williams who never condescends to inform us of the actual contents of that iron chest which makes such a figure in his interesting work and gives the name to mr colman s drama the public had some claim to inquire into this matter but it seemed indifferent policy in the author to give the explanation for whatever praise may be due to the ingenuity which brings to a general combination all the loose threads of a narrative like the knitter at the finishing of her stocking i am greatly deceived if in many cases a superior advantage is not attained by the air of reality which the deficiency of explanation attaches to a work written on a different system in life itself many things befall every mortal of which the individual never knows the real cause or origin and were we to point out the most marked distinction between a real and a fictitious narrative we would say that the former in reference to the remote causes of the events it relates is obscure doubtful and mysterious whereas in the latter case it is a part of the author s duty to afford satisfactory details upon the causes of the separate events he has recorded and in a word to account for every thing the reader like mungo in the padlock will not be satisfied with hearing what he is not made fully to comprehend i omitted therefore in the introduction to the abbot any attempt to explain the previous story or to apologize for unintelligibility neither would it have been prudent to have endeavoured to proclaim in the introduction to the abbot the real spring by which i hoped it might attract a greater degree of interest than its immediate predecessor a taking title or the announcement of a popular subject is a recipe for success much in favour with booksellers but which authors will not always find efficacious the cause is worth a moment s examination there occur in every country some peculiar historical characters which are like a spell or charm sovereign to excite curiosity and attract attention since every one in the slightest degree interested in the land which they belong to has heard much of them and longs to hear more a tale turning on the fortunes of alfred or elizabeth in england or of wallace or bruce in scotland is sure by the very announcement to excite public

and mosaics that the whole world flock there to see them people go there chiefly in the winter at that season the town is crowded with strangers a great many people too go there in the winter to avoid the cold weather which prevails at that time of the year in all the more northerly countries of europe there is so little winter in florence that few of the houses have any fireplaces in them except in the kitchen when there comes a cold day the people warm themselves by means of a jug or jar of earthen ware with a handle passing over across the top by which they carry it about they fill these jars half full of hot embers and so carry them with them wherever they want to go the women when they sit down put the jar under their dresses on the floor or pavement beneath them and the men place it right before them between their feet you will see market women and flower girls sitting in the corners of the streets in the winter attending to their business and keeping themselves warm all the time with these little fire jars and artists in the palaces and picture galleries each with one of them by his side or close before him while he is at work copying the works of the great masters or making drawings from the antique statues there is another very curious use that the people of florence make of these jars and that is they warm the beds with them when any body is sick so as to require this indulgence you would think it very difficult to warm a bed with an open jar filled with burning embers the way they do it is this they hang the jar in the inside of a sort of wooden cage shaped like a bushel basket and about as large they turn this cage upside down and hang the jar up in it by means of a hook depending inside they turn down the bed clothes and put the cage in it jar of coals and all they then put back the bed clothes and cover the cage all up they leave it so for a quarter of an hour and then carefully turning the clothes down again they take the jar out and the bed is warmed but to return to mr george and rollo they engaged a vetturino for the first time at florence mr george had gone to florence chiefly for the purpose of examining the immense collections of paintings and statuary which exist there rollo went not on account of the paintings or statues for he did not care much about such things but because he liked to go any where where he could see new places and be entertained by new scenes accordingly while mr george was at work in the galleries of florence studying by the help of catalogues the famous specimens of ancient art rollo was usually rambling about the streets observing the manners and customs of the people and watching the singular and curious scenes that every where met his eye the reason why there are so many paintings and sculptures in italy is this in the middle ages it was the fashion in all the central parts of europe for the people to spend almost all their surplus money in building and decorating churches indeed there was then very little else that they could do at the present time people invest their funds as fast as they accumulate them in building ships and railroads docks for the storage of merchandise houses and stores in cities to let for the sake of the rent and country seats or pretty private residences of various kinds for themselves but in the middle ages very little could be done in the way of investments like these there were no railroads and there was very little use for ships there was no profit to be gained by building houses and stores for there were so many wars and commotions among the people of the different towns and kingdoms that nothing was stable or safe for the same reason it was useless for men to spend their money in building and ornamenting their own houses for at the first approach of an enemy the town in which they lived was likely to be sacked and their houses and all the fine furniture which they might contain would be burned or destroyed but the churches were safe the people of the different countries had so much veneration for sacred places and for every thing connected with religion that they were afraid to touch or injure any thing that had been consecrated to a religious use to plunder a church or a convent or an abbey or to do any thing to injure or destroy the property that they contained was regarded as sacrilege and sacrilege they deemed a dreadful crime abhorred by god and man thus while they would burn and destroy hundreds of dwellings without any remorse and turn the wretched inmates out at midnight into the streets to die of exposure terror and despair they would stop at once when they came to the church afraid to harm it in any way or to touch the least thing that it contained accordingly while every thing else in a conquered town was doomed to the most reckless destruction all that was in the church the most delicate paintings and the most costly gold and silver images and utensils were as safe as if they were surrounded by impregnable castle walls of course these notions were very mistaken ones according to the teachings of our lord and saviour jesus christ it must be a greater sin to burn down the cottage of a poor widow and turn her out at midnight into the streets to die than to plunder for gain the richest altar in the world from these and various other similar causes it happened that in the middle

delicate and spiritual a concert as the first a field piece was then discharged from the top of a neighboring hill and gave birth to one long reverberation which ran round the circle of mountains in an unbroken chain of sound and rolled away without a separate echo after these experiments the cold atmosphere drove us all into the house with the keenest appetites for supper it did one s heart good

and much experienced cannot but produce a beneficial impression even upon a mind formed and upon principles developed how infinitely more powerful must the influence of such communion be upon a youthful heart ardent innocent and unpractised as vivian was not to figure in the microcosm of a public school a place for which from his temper he was almost better fitted than any young genius whom the playing fields of eton or the hills of winton can remember there was some difficulty in fixing upon his future academus mr grey s two axioms were first that no one so young as his son should settle in the metropolis and that vivian must consequently not have a private tutor and secondly that all private schools were quite worthless and therefore there was every probability of vivian not

perplexing me and yourself too for nothing i was fool enough when i came here from nice after papa s death to let you talk nonsense to me for a month or two did you or did you not swear that you loved me oh mr clavering i did not imagine that your strength would have condescended to take such advantage over the weakness of a woman i remember no oaths of any kind and what foolish assertions i may have made i am not going to repeat it must have become manifest to you during these two years that all that was a romance if it be a pleasure to you to look back to it of that pleasure i cannot deprive you perhaps i also may sometimes look back but i shall never speak of that time again and you if you are as noble as i take you to be will not speak of it either i know you would not wish to injure me i would wish to save you from the misery you are bringing on yourself in that you must allow me to look after myself lord ongar certainly wants a wife and i intend to be true to him and useful how about love and to love him sir do you think that no man can win a woman s love unless he is filled to the brim with poetry and has a neck like lord byron and is handsome like your worship you are very handsome harry and you too should go into the market and make the best of yourself why should you not learn to love some nice girl that has money to assist you julia no sir i will not be called julia if you do i will be insulted and leave you instantly i may call you harry as being so much younger though we were born in the same month and as a sort of cousin but i shall never do that after to day you have courage enough then to tell me that you have not ill used me certainly i have why what a fool you would have me be look at me and tell me whether i am fit to be the wife of such a one as you by the time you are entering the world i shall be an old woman and shall have lived my life even if i were fit to be your mate when we were living here together am i fit after what i have

to turn for it so that my husband may not be dunned for my debts as soon as he has married me what a wife i should have been for you should i not i could pay the six hundred pounds for you with money that i have earned myself though you do call me an usher and perhaps would ask fewer questions about it than lord ongar will do with all his thousands dear harry i beg your pardon about the usher of course i know that you are a fellow of your college and that st cuthbert s where you teach the boys is one of the grandest schools in england and i hope you ll be a bishop nay i think you will if you

everything for yourself but nothing is anything without your love pshaw love indeed what could it do for you but ruin you you know it as well as i do but you are selfish enough to wish to continue a romance which would be absolutely destructive to me though for a while it might afford a pleasant relaxation to your graver studies harry you can choose in the world you have divinity and law and literature and art and if debarred from love now by the exigencies of labor you will be as fit for love in ten years time as you are at present but i do love now be a man then and keep it to yourself

upper ten the latter with the lower ten trollope with the suburban and country town ten the three together giving us a very complete and detailed picture of the lives led by our grandmothers and grandfathers whose hearts were in the same place as our own but whose manners of speech of behaviour and of dress have now entered into the vague region known as the days of yore the three clerks is an excellent example of trollope s handiwork the development of the plot is sufficiently skilful to maintain the reader s interest and the major part of the characters is lifelike always well observed and sometimes depicted with singular skill and insight trollope himself liked the work well the plot is not so good as that of the macdermots nor are any characters in the book equal to those of mrs proudie and the warden but the work has a more continued interest and contains the first well described love scene that i ever wrote the passage in which kate woodward thinking she will die tries to take leave of the lad she loves still brings tears to my eyes when i read it i had not the heart to kill her i never could do that and i do not doubt that they are living happily together to this day the lawyer chaffanbrass made his first appearance in this novel and i do not think that i have cause to be ashamed of him but this novel now is chiefly noticeable to me from the fact that in it i introduced a character under the name of sir gregory hardlines by which i intended to lean very heavily on that much loathed scheme of competitive examination of which at that time sir charles trevelyan was the great apostle sir gregory hardlines was intended for sir charles trevelyan as any one at the time would know who had taken an interest in the civil service we always call him sir gregory lady trevelyan said to me afterwards when i came to know her husband i never learned to love competitive examination but i became and am very fond of sir charles trevelyan sir stafford northcote who is now chancellor of the exchequer was then leagued with his friend sir charles and he too appears in the three clerks under the feebly facetious name of sir warwick west end but for all that the three clerks was a good novel which excerpt from trollope s autobiography serves to throw light not only upon the novel in question but also upon the character of its author trollope served honestly and efficiently for many a long year in the post office achieving his entrance through a farce of an examination the story of that examination he says is given accurately in the opening chapters of a novel written by me called the three clerks if any reader of this memoir would refer to that chapter and see how charley tudor was supposed to have been admitted into the internal navigation office that reader will learn how anthony trollope was actually admitted into the secretary s office of the general post office in poe s description of the manner in which he wrote the raven is incredible being probably one of his solemn and sombre jokes equally incredible is trollope s confession of his humdrum mechanical methods of work doubtless he believed he was telling the whole truth but only here and there in his autobiography does he permit to peep out touches of light which complete the portrait of himself it is impossible that for the reader any character in fiction should live which has not been alive to its creator so is it with trollope who speaking of his characters says i have wandered alone among the rooks and woods crying at their grief laughing at their absurdities and thoroughly enjoying their joy i have been impregnated with my own creations till it has been my only excitement to sit with the pen in my hand and drive my team before me at as quick a pace as i could make them travel there is a plain matter of factness about trollope s narratives which is convincing making it difficult for the reader to call himself back to fact and to remember that he has been wandering in a world of fiction in the three clerks the young men who give the tale its title are all well drawn to accomplish this in the cases of alaric and charley tudor was easy enough for a skilled writer but to breathe life into harry norman was difficult at first he appears to be a lay figure a priggish dummy of an immaculate hero a failure in portraiture but toward the end of the book it is borne in on us that our dislike had been aroused by the lifelike nature of the painting dislike toward a real man priggish indeed in many ways but with a very human strain of obstinacy and obdurateness which few writers would have permitted to have entered into the make up of any of their heroes of the other men undy scott may be named as among the very best pieces of portraiture in victorian fiction touch after touch of detail is added to the picture with really admirable skill and undy lives in the reader s memory as vividly as he must have existed in the imagination of his creator there are some strong and curious passages in chapter xliv in which the novelist contrasts the lives and fates of varney bill sykes and undy scott they stir the blood proving uncontestibly that undy scott was as real to trollope as he is to us the figure of undy swinging from a gibbet at the broad end of lombard street would have an effect ah my fingers itch to be at the rope trollope possessed the rare and beautiful gift of painting the hearts and souls of young girls and of this power he has given an admirable example in katie woodward it would be foolish and cruel to attempt to epitomize or rather to draw in miniature this portrait that trollope has drawn at full length were it not for any other end those that are fond of all that is graceful and charming

depends upon sympathy said elizabeth well but i do not see said katherine no no said elizabeth we all know that you will be happy enough with your beloved harriet how frivolous and silly you will be by the end of the first evening she has been here i am sure i think harriet is very silly indeed said katherine i cannot bear her vulgar ways bouncing about as she does and such dress i never did see last time she was here she had a great large artificial rose upon her bonnet i wonder what papa would say if he saw me in such a thing pray keep the same opinion of her all the time she is here kate said elizabeth but i know you too well to trust you i only know they will keep me in a perpetual state of irritation all the time and i hope that will not quite spoil my mind for the service how can you talk of mamma s relations in that way lizzie said helen i do not care whose relations they are said elizabeth if people will be disagreeable i must say so mrs staunton used to say replied helen that people always ought to keep up their connexion with their relations whether they like them or not there were some very stupid people relations of mr staunton s near dykelands whom fanny and jane could not endure but she used to ask them to dinner very often and always made a point well if i had any disagreeable relations said elizabeth i would make a point of cutting them i do not see why relations have a right to be disagreeable i do not see how you could said helen for instance would you prevent mamma from ever seeing the major her own brother he cannot be half so well worth seeing since he chose to marry such a horrid wife said elizabeth would you never see horace again if he did such a thing said katherine i am sure i would not give him up would you i could trust horace i

about a man who had married never mind dykelands now helen said elizabeth and do put down your pencil that drawing was tolerable before luncheon but you have been making your tree more like mr dillon s sunday periwig every minute since i have been here and such a shadow but do not stop to mend it you will not do any good now and here is some better work mamma wants us to help to finish the cushions we must do something to earn the pleasure of having st austin s church consecrated on st austin s day what do you mean that i am to work on that hard velvet said helen who was a little mortified by the unsparing criticism on her drawing yes i undertook that we three should make up the two cushions for the desk and eagle mrs webbe s hands are full of business already but she has explained it all to me and kate will understand it better than i can i thought sarah webbe was to help said helen she is doing the carpet said elizabeth oh if you look so lamentable about it helen we do not want your help dora will sew the seams very nicely and enjoy the work too i thought you might be glad to turn your handiwork to some account really lizzie said helen i shall be very glad to be useful if you want me what shall i do this was said in no gracious tone and elizabeth would not accept such an offer of assistance no no never mind said she putting a skein of crimson sewing silk over

had thus heard of all the arrangements which had been made that afternoon went on talking to katherine as soon as church is over the bishop is coming to luncheon here and then to settle some business with papa then is to be the school children s feast in the quadrangle of course oh how delightful that will be and mamma and i have been settling that we will have a little table for the smallest creatures because the elder sisters get no time to eat if they are attending to them and if the little ones are all together everyone will come and help them the old women in the alms houses will said katherine yes and dora will manage that nicely too the table will not be too high for her to reach and she will be very happy to be able to wait on her little class and they are to have tea and cake instead of dinner for we do not want to have more cooking than can be helped that people may not be prevented from going to church and the children will be thirsty after being in church all the morning but we have a dinner party do not we said katherine yes but our youth and innocence will save us from being much plagued by it said elizabeth oh i thought you and anne at least would dine with the company said katherine so mamma thought said elizabeth but then she recollected that if we did and not harriet mrs hazleby would be mortally offended and when we came to reckon it appeared that there would be thirteen without us and then papa and i persuaded her that it would be much less uncivil to leave out all the misses than to take one and leave the rest you know anne and i are both

pursuant to the awards of the commissioners under the act of the d of march if however it should not be deemed advisable to carry that recommendation into effect i would suggest that authority be given for investing the principal over the proceeds of the surplus referred to in good securities with a view to the satisfaction of such other just claims of our citizens against china as are not unlikely to arise hereafter in the course of our extensive trade with that empire by the act of the th of august last congress authorized the president to instruct the commanders of suitable vessels to defend themselves against and to capture pirates this authority has been exercised in a single instance only for the more effectual protection of our extensive and valuable commerce in the eastern seas especially it seems to me that it would also be advisable to authorize the commanders of sailing vessels to recapture any prizes which pirates may make of united states vessels and their cargoes and the consular courts now established by law in eastern countries to adjudicate the cases in the event that this should not be objected to by the local authorities if any good reason exists why we should persevere longer in withholding our recognition of the independence and sovereignty of hayti and liberia i am unable to discern it unwilling however to inaugurate a novel policy in regard to them without the approbation of congress i submit for your consideration the expediency of an appropriation for maintaining a charge d affaires near each of those new states it does not admit of doubt that important commercial advantages might be secured by favorable treaties with them the operations of the treasury during the period which has elapsed since your adjournment have been conducted with signal success the patriotism of the people has placed at the disposal of the government the large means demanded by the public exigencies much of the national loan has been taken by citizens of the industrial classes whose confidence in their country s faith and zeal for their country s deliverance from present peril have induced them to contribute to the support of the government the whole of their limited acquisitions this fact imposes peculiar obligations to economy in disbursement and energy in action the revenue from all sources including loans for the financial year ending on the th

treasury it is gratifying to know that the expenditures made necessary by the rebellion are not beyond the resources of the loyal people and to believe that the same patriotism which has thus far sustained the government will continue to sustain it till peace and union shall again bless the land i respectfully refer to the report of the secretary of war for information respecting the numerical strength of the army and for recommendations having in view an increase of its efficiency and the well being of the various branches of the service intrusted to his care it is gratifying to know that the patriotism of the people has proved equal to the occasion and that the number of troops tendered greatly exceeds the force which congress authorized me to call into the field i refer with pleasure to those portions of his report which make allusion to the creditable degree of discipline already attained by our troops and to the excellent sanitary condition of the entire army the recommendation of the secretary for an organization of the militia upon a uniform basis is a subject of vital importance to the future safety of the country and is commended to the serious attention of congress the large addition to the regular army in connection with the defection that has so considerably diminished the number of its officers gives peculiar importance to his recommendation for increasing the corps of cadets to the greatest capacity of the military academy by mere omission i presume congress has failed to provide chaplains for hospitals occupied by volunteers this subject was brought to my notice and i was induced to draw up the form of a letter one copy of which properly addressed has been delivered to each of the persons and at the dates respectively named and stated in a schedule containing also the form of the letter marked a and herewith transmitted these gentlemen i understand entered upon the duties designated at the times respectively stated in the schedule and have labored faithfully therein ever since i therefore recommend that they be compensated at the same rate as chaplains in the army i further suggest that general provision be made for chaplains to serve at hospitals as well as with regiments the report of the secretary of the navy presents in detail the operations of that branch of the service the activity and energy which have characterized its administration and the results of measures to increase its efficiency and power such have been the additions by construction and purchase that it may almost be said a navy has been created and brought

train his mind were within his reach no school no university no legal faculty had any part in training his powers when he became a lawyer and a politician the years most favourable to continuous study had already passed and the opportunities he found for reading were very scanty he knew but few authors in general literature though he knew those few thoroughly he taught himself a little mathematics but he could read no language save his own and can have had only the faintest acquaintance with european history or with any branch of philosophy the want of regular education was not made up for by the persons among whom his lot was cast till he was a grown man he never moved in any society from which he could learn those things with which the mind of an orator or a statesman ought to be stored even after he had gained some legal practice there was for many years no one for him to mix with except the petty practitioners of a petty town men nearly all of whom knew little more than he did himself schools gave him nothing and society gave him nothing but he had a powerful intellect and a resolute will isolation fostered not only self reliance but the habit of reflection and indeed of prolonged and intense reflection he made all that he knew a part of himself he thought everything out for himself his convictions were his own clear and coherent he was not positive or opinionated and he did not deny that at certain moments he pondered and hesitated long before he decided on his course but though he could keep a policy in suspense waiting for events to guide him he did not waver he paused and reconsidered but it was never his way either to go back upon a decision once made or to waste time in vain regrets that all he expected had not been attained he took advice readily and left many things to his ministers but he did not lean upon his advisers without vanity or ostentation he was always independent self contained prepared to take full responsibility for his acts that he was keenly observant of all that passed under his eyes that his mind played freely round everything it touched we know from the accounts of his talk which first made him famous in the town and neighbourhood where he lived his humour and his memory for anecdotes which he could bring out to good purpose at the right moment are qualities which europe deems distinctively american but no great man of action in the nineteenth century even in america possessed them in the same measure seldom has so acute a power of observation been found united to so abundant a power of sympathy these remarks may seem to belong to a study of his character rather than of his speeches yet they are not irrelevant because the interest of his speeches lies in their revelation of his character let us however return to the speeches and to the letters some of which given in this volume are scarcely less noteworthy than are the speeches what are the distinctive merits of these speeches and letters there is less humour in them than his reputation as a humorist would have led us to expect they are serious grave practical we feel that the man does not care to play over the surface of the subject or to use it as a way of displaying his cleverness he is trying to get right down to the very foundation of the matter and tell us what his real thoughts about it are in this respect he sometimes reminds us of bismarck s speeches which in their rude broken forth darting way always go straight to their destined aim always hit the nail on the head so too in their effort to grapple with fundamental facts lincoln s bear a sort of likeness to cromwell s speeches though cromwell has far less power of utterance and always seems to be wrestling with the difficulty of finding language to convey to others what is plain true and weighty to himself this difficulty makes the great protector though we can usually see what he is driving at frequently confused and obscure lincoln however is always clear simplicity directness and breadth are the notes of his thought aptness clearness and again simplicity are the notes of his diction the american speakers of his generation like most of those of the preceding generation but unlike those of that earlier generation to which alexander hamilton john adams marshall and madison belonged were generally infected by a floridity which made them a by word in europe even men of brilliant talent such as edward everett were by no means free from this straining after effect by highly coloured phrases and theatrical effects such faults have to day virtually vanished from the united states largely from a change in public taste to which perhaps the example set by lincoln himself may have contributed in the forties and fifties florid rhetoric was rampant especially in the west and south where taste was less polished than in the older states that lincoln escaped it is a striking mark of his independence as well as of his greatness there is no superfluous ornament in his orations nothing tawdry nothing otiose for the most part he addresses the reason of his hearers and credits them with desiring to have none but solid arguments laid before them when he does appeal to emotion he does it quietly perhaps even solemnly the note struck is always a high note the impressiveness of the appeal comes not from fervid vehemence of language but from the sincerity of his own convictions sometimes one can see that through its whole course the argument is suffused by the speaker s feeling and when the time comes for the feeling to be directly expressed it glows not with fitful flashes but with the steady heat of an intense and strenuous soul the impression which most of the speeches leave on the reader is that their matter has been carefully thought over even when the words have not been learn

half tenderly half reproachfully let me keep my old place till i know in what character i am to fill the new the man you trusted has deserted you the boy you pitied will prove loyal try him pauline i will and with the bitter smile unchanged upon her lips the low voice unshaken in its tones the deep eyes unwavering in their gaze pauline went on you know my past happy as a dream till eighteen then all was swept away home fortune friends and i was left like an unfledged bird without even the shelter of a cage for five years i have made my life what i could humble honest but never happy till i came here for here i saw gilbert in the poor companion of your guardian s daughter he seemed to see the heiress i had been and treated me as such this flattered my pride and touched my heart he was kind i grateful then he loved me and god knows how utterly i loved him a few months of happiness the purest then he went to make home ready for me and i believed him for where i wholly love i wholly trust while my own peace was undisturbed i learned to read the language of your eyes manuel to find the boy grown into the man the friend warmed into a lover your youth had kept me blind too long your society had grown dear to me and i loved you like a sister for your unvarying kindness to the solitary woman who earned her bread and found it bitter i told you my secret to prevent the utterance of your own you remember the promise you made me then keep it still and bury the knowledge of my lost happiness deep in your pitying heart as i shall in my proud one now the storm is over and i am ready for my work again but it must be a new task in a new scene i hate this house this room the faces i must meet the duties i must perform for the memory of that traitor haunts them all i see a future full of interest a stage whereon i could play a stirring part i long for it intensely yet cannot make it mine alone manuel do you love me still bending suddenly she brushed back the dark hair that streaked his forehead and searched the face that in an instant answered her like a swift rising light the eloquent blood rushed over swarthy cheek and brow the slumberous softness of the eyes kindled with a flash and the lips sensitive as any woman s trembled yet broke into a rapturous smile as he cried with fervent brevity i would die for you a look of triumph swept across her face for with this boy as chivalrous as ardent she knew that words were not mere breath still with her stern purpose uppermost she changed the bitter smile into one half timid half tender as she bent still nearer manuel in a week i leave the island shall i go alone no pauline he understood her now she saw it in the sudden paleness that fell on him heard it in the rapid beating of his heart felt it in the strong grasp that fastened on her hand and knew that the first step was won a regretful pang smote her but the dark mood which had taken possession of her stifled the generous warnings of her better self and drove her on listen manuel a strange spirit rules me tonight but i will have no reserves from you all shall be told then if you will come be it so if not i shall go my way as solitary as i came if you think that this loss has broken my heart undeceive yourself for such as i live years in an hour and show no sign i have shed no tears uttered no cry asked no comfort yet since i read that letter i have suffered more than many suffer in a lifetime i am not one to lament long over any hopeless sorrow a single paroxysm sharp and short and it is over contempt has killed my love i have buried it and no power can make it live again except as a pale ghost that will not rest till gilbert shall pass through an hour as bitter as the last is that the task you give yourself pauline the savage element that lurks in southern blood leaped up in the boy s heart as he listened glittered in his eye and involuntarily found expression in the nervous grip of the hands that folded a fairer one between them alas for pauline that she had roused the sleeping devil and was glad to see it yes it is weak wicked and unwomanly yet i persist as relentlessly as any indian on a war trail see me as i am not the gay girl you have known but a revengeful woman with but one tender spot now left in her heart the place you fill i have been wronged and i long to right myself at once time is too slow i cannot wait for that man must be taught that two can play at the game of hearts taught soon and sharply i can do this can wound as i have been wounded can sting him with contempt and prove that i too can forget go on pauline show me how i am to help you manuel i want fortune rank splendor and power you can give me all these and a faithful friend beside i desire to show gilbert the creature he deserted no longer

is quite difficult to drop the pail in such a manner as to get any water when the vessel is under way i should like to try said marco you can find out whether the water is salt easier than that said forester you can let a twine string down and wet the end that will take up enough for a taste well said marco if i ve got a string long enough so saying he began to feel in his pockets for a string he found a piece of twine which he thought would be long enough but on trial it appeared that it would not reach quite to the water forester then tied it to the end of his cane and allowed marco to take the cane and hold it over the side of the vessel and by this means he succeeded in reaching the water and wetting the end of the string he could after all succeed in wetting only a small part of the string for it was drawn along so rapidly by the motion of the boat that it skipped upon the surface of the water without sinking in at length however after he had got the end a little wetted he drew it up and put it in his mouth how does it taste said forester the question was hardly necessary for the faces which marco made showed sufficiently plain that the water was bitter and salt yes it is salt said he then suddenly casting his eye upon a long dark looking substance which just then came floating by he called out why forester what is that a log said forester the log was round and straight and the ends were square the log glided rapidly by and soon disappeared it is a pine log said forester there are vast forests of pine trees in this state they cut down the trees and then cut the trunks into pieces of moderate length and draw them on the snow to the rivers then in the spring the waters rise and float the logs down this is one of these logs floating down sometimes the river is quite full of them where do they go asked marco oh men stop them all along the river and put them into booms and then fasten them together in rafts how do they fasten them together asked marco they drive a pin into the middle of each log and then extend a rope along fastening it to each pin in this manner the rope holds the logs together and they form a long raft when they catch the logs in booms they afterwards form them into rafts and so float them down the river to the mills where they are to be sawed can men stand upon the rafts said marco yes replied forester very well they make a floor of boards i suppose said marco no replied forester they stand directly upon the logs i should think the logs would sink under them replied marco or at least roll about they sink a little replied forester just about as much as the bulk of the man who stands upon them i don t know what you mean by that exactly said marco why the rule of floating bodies is this rejoined forester when any substance like a cake of ice or a log of wood or a boat is floating upon the water a part of it being above the water and a part under the water if a man steps upon it he makes it sink enough deeper to submerge a part of the wood or ice as large as he is himself if there is just as much of the wood or ice above the water as is equal to the bulk of the man then the man in stepping upon it will sink it just to the water s edge but perhaps one man would be heavier than another man said marco yes replied forester but then he would be larger and so according to the principle he would make more wood sink before the equilibrium was reached what is equilibrium asked marco equilibrium is an equality between two forces replied forester i don t see what two forces there are said marco there is the weight of the man pressing downwards said forester for one and the buoyant power of the water that is its upward pressure for the other the weight of the man remains constantly the same but the upward pressure of the water increases in proportion as the log sinks into it for the deeper the log sinks into the water the more of it is submerged and it is more acted upon and pressed upward by the water now as one of these forces remains constant and the other increases they must at length come to be equal that is in equilibrium and then the log will not sink any farther that s the philosophy of it marco marco did not reply but sat looking at the barren and rocky shores of the river as the boat glided by them presently another log came into view there said forester look at that log and see whether you think that you could float upon it yes said marco i think i could it depends said forester on the question whether the part of it which is out of water is as big as you are i think it is said marco yes added forester i have no doubt that it is only i should roll off said marco true replied forester but the millmen who work about the logs acquire astonishing dexterity in standing upon them if there is only enough of the log above water to equal their bulk so that it has buoyant power enough to float them they will keep it steady with their feet and sail about upon it very safely i should like to try said marco perhaps we shall have an opportunity at some place on the river said forester here marco suddenly interrupted the conversation by pointing up the river to a column of smoke and steam which he saw rising beyond a point of land which was just before them here comes another steamboat said he see forester no said forester i believe that is a steam mill a steam mill repeated marco yes replied forester they have steam mills and tide mills to saw up the logs in this part of the river farther up where there are waterfalls on the r

such as feather dusters and lamp chimneys that couldn t possibly last ten years don t you see my position i saw it we did not get that furnished house euphemia was greatly disappointed it would have been just splendid she said to have taken our book and have ordered all these things at the stores one after another without even being obliged to ask the price i had my private doubts in regard to this matter of price i am afraid that euphemia generally set down the lowest price and the best things she did not mean to mislead and her plan certainly made our book attractive but it did not work very well in practice we have a friend who undertook to furnish her house by our book and she never could get the things as cheaply as we had them quoted but you see said euphemia to her we had to put them down at very low prices because the model house we speak of in the book is to be entirely furnished for just so much but in spite of this explanation the lady was not satisfied we found ourselves obliged to give up the idea of a furnished house we would have taken an unfurnished one and furnished it ourselves but we had not money enough we were dreadfully afraid that we should have to continue to board it was now getting on toward summer at least there was only a part of a month of spring left and whenever i could get off from my business euphemia and i made little excursions into the country round about the city one afternoon we went up the river and there we saw a sight that transfixed us as it were on the bank a mile or so above the city stood a canal boat i say stood because it was so firmly imbedded in the ground by the river side that it would have been almost as impossible to move it as to have turned the sphinx around this boat we soon found was inhabited by an oyster man and his family they had lived there for many years and were really doing quite well the boat was divided inside into rooms and these were papered and painted and nicely furnished there was a kitchen a living room a parlor and bedrooms there were all sorts of conveniences carpets on the floors pictures and everything at least so it seemed to us to make a home comfortable this was not all done at once the oyster man told me they had lived there for years and had gradually added this and that until the place was as we saw it he had an oyster bed out in the river and he made cider in the winter but where he got the apples i don t know there was really no reason why he should not get rich in time well we went all over that house and we praised everything so much that the oyster man s wife was delighted and when we had some stewed oysters afterward eating them at a little table under a tree near by i believe that she picked out the very largest oysters she had to stew for us when we had finished our supper and had paid for it and were going down to take our little boat again for we had rowed up the river euphemia stopped and looked around her then she clasped her hands and exclaimed in an ecstatic undertone we must have a canal boat and she never swerved from that determination after i had seriously thought over the matter i could see no good reason against adopting this plan it would certainly be a cheap method of living and it would really be housekeeping i grew more and more in favor of it after what the oyster man had done what might not we do he had never written a book on housekeeping nor in all probability had he considered the matter philosophically for one moment in all his life but it was not an easy thing to find a canal boat there were none advertised for rent at least not for housekeeping purposes we made many inquiries and took many a long walk along the water courses in the vicinity of the city but all in vain of course we talked a great deal about our project and our friends became greatly interested in it and of course too they gave us a great deal of advice but we didn t mind that we were philosophical enough to know that you can t have shad without bones they were good friends and by being careful in regard to the advice it didn t interfere with our comfort we were beginning to be discouraged at least euphemia was her discouragement is like water cresses it generally comes up in a very short time after she sows her wishes but then it withers away rapidly which is a comfort one evening we were sitting rather disconsolately in our room and i was reading out the advertisements of country board in a newspaper when in rushed dr heare one of our old friends he was so full of something that he had to say that he didn t even ask us how we were in fact he didn t appear to want to know i tell you what it is said he i have found just the very thing you want a canal boat i cried yes said he a canal boat furnished asked euphemia her eyes glistening well no answered the doctor i don t think you could expect that but we can t live on the bare floor said euphemia our house must be furnished well then i suppose this won t do said the doctor ruefully for there isn t so much as a boot jack in it it has most things that are necessary for a boat but it hasn t anything that you could call house furniture but dear me i should think you could furnish it very cheaply and comfortably out of your book very true said euphemia if we could pick out the cheapest things and then get some folks to buy a lot of the books we could begin with very little said i trying hard to keep calm certainly said the doctor you need make no more rooms at first than you could furnish then there are no rooms said euphemia no

canopy with embossings of gold borne over him and was guarded with twelve lances from the waist to the ground was all cloth of gold and that very rich in the attire of his head were finely wreathed in diverse rings of plaited gold of an inch or more in breadth which made a fair and princely show somewhat resembling a crown in form about his neck he had a chain of perfect gold the links very great and one fold double on his left hand was a diamond an emerald a ruby and a turky on his right hand in one ring a big and perfect turky and in another ring many diamonds of a smaller size all this glitter of barbaric gold was the produce of the spice trade of which the sultans kept the monopoly and by which they became wealthy ternate with the small islands in a line south of it as far as batchian constitute the ancient moluccas the native country of the clove as well as the only part in which it was cultivated nutmegs and mace were procured from the natives of new guinea and the adjacent islands where they grew wild and the profits on spice cargoes were so enormous that the european traders were glad to give gold and jewels and the finest manufactures of europe or of india in exchange when the dutch established their influence in these seas and relieved the native princes from their portuguese oppressors they saw that the easiest way to repay themselves would be to get this spice trade into their own hands for this purpose they adopted the wise principle of concentrating the culture of these valuable products in those spots only of which they could have complete control to do this effectually it was necessary to abolish the culture and trade in all other places which they succeeded in doing by treaty with the native rulers these agreed to have all the spice trees in their possessions destroyed they gave up large though fluctuating revenues but they gained in return a fixed subsidy freedom from the constant attacks and harsh oppressions of the portuguese and a continuance of their regal power and exclusive authority over their own subjects which is maintained in all the islands except ternate to this day it is no doubt supposed by most englishmen who have been accustomed to look upon this act of the dutch with vague horror as something utterly unprincipled and barbarous that the native population suffered grievously by this destruction of such valuable property but it is certain that this was not the case the sultans kept this lucrative trade entirely in their own hands as a rigid monopoly and they would take care not to give their subjects more than would amount to their usual wages while they would surely exact as large a quantity of spice as they could possibly obtain drake and other early voyagers always seem to have purchased their spice cargoes from the sultans and rajahs and not from the cultivators now the absorption of so much labour in the cultivation of this one product must necessarily have raised the price of food and other necessaries and when it was abolished more rice would be grown more sago made more fish caught and more tortoise shell rattan gum dammer and other valuable products of the seas and the forests would be obtained i believe therefore that this abolition of the spice trade in the moluccas was actually beneficial to the inhabitants and that it was an act both wise in itself and morally and politically justifiable in the selection of the places in which to carry on the cultivation the dutch were not altogether fortunate or wise banda was chosen for nutmegs and was eminently successful since it continues to this day to produce a large supply of this spice and to yield a considerable revenue amboyna was fixed upon for establishing the clove cultivation but the soil and climate although apparently very similar to that of its native islands is not favourable and for some years the government have actually been paying to the cultivators a higher rate than they could purchase cloves elsewhere owing to a great fall in the price since the rate of payment was fixed for a term of years by the dutch government and which rate is still most honourably paid in walking about the suburbs of ternate we find everywhere the ruins of massive stone and brick buildings gateways and arches showing at once the superior wealth of the ancient town and the destructive effects of earthquakes it was during my second stay in the town after my return from new guinea that i first felt an earthquake it was a very slight one scarcely more than has been felt in this country but occurring in a place that lad been many times destroyed by them it was rather more exciting i had just awoke at gun fire a m when suddenly the thatch began to rustle and shake as if an army of cats were galloping over it and immediately afterwards my bed shook too so that for an instant i imagined myself back in new guinea in my fragile house which shook when an old cock went to roost on the ridge but remembering that i was now on a solid earthen floor i said to myself why it s an earthquake and lay still in the pleasing expectation of another shock but none came and this was the only earthquake i ever felt in ternate the last great one was in february when almost every house in the place was destroyed it began about midnight on the chinese new year s festival at which time every one stays up nearly all night feasting at the chinamen s houses and seeing the processions this prevented any lives being lost as every one ran out of doors at the first shock which was not very severe the second a few minutes afterwards threw down a great many houses and others which continued all night and part of the next day completed the devastation the line of disturbance was very

require this indulgence you would think it very difficult to warm a bed with an open jar filled with burning embers the way they do it is this they hang the jar in the inside of a sort of wooden cage shaped like a bushel basket and about as large they turn this cage upside down and hang the jar up in it by means of a hook depending inside they turn down the bed clothes and put the cage in it jar of coals and all they then put back the bed clothes and cover the cage all up they leave it so for a quarter of an hour and then carefully turning the clothes down again they take the jar out and the bed is warmed but to return to mr george and rollo they engaged a vetturino for the first time at florence mr george had gone to florence chiefly for the purpose of examining the immense collections of paintings and statuary which exist there rollo went not on account of the paintings or statues for he did not care much about such things but because he liked to go any where where he could see new places and be entertained by new scenes accordingly while mr george was at work in the galleries of florence studying by the help of catalogues the famous specimens of ancient art rollo was usually rambling about the streets observing the manners and customs of the people and watching the singular and curious scenes that every where met his eye the reason why there are so many paintings and sculptures in italy is this in the middle ages it was the fashion in all the central parts of europe for the people to spend almost all their surplus money in building and decorating churches indeed there was then very little else that they could do at the present time people invest their funds as fast as they accumulate them in building ships and railroads docks for the storage of merchandise houses and stores in cities to let for the sake of the rent and country seats or pretty private residences of various kinds for themselves but in the middle ages very little could be done in the way of investments like these there were no railroads and there was very little use for ships there was no profit to be gained by building houses and stores for there were so many wars and commotions among the people of the different towns and kingdoms that nothing was stable or safe for the same reason it was useless for men to spend their money in building and ornamenting their own houses for at the first approach of an enemy the town in which they lived was likely to be sacked and their houses and all the fine furniture which they might contain would be burned or destroyed but the churches were safe the people of the different countries had so much veneration for sacred places and for every thing connected with religion that they were afraid to touch or injure any thing that had been consecrated to a religious use to plunder a church or a convent or an abbey or to do any thing to injure or destroy the property that they contained was regarded as sacrilege and sacrilege they deemed a dreadful crime abhorred by god and man thus while they would burn and destroy hundreds of dwellings without any remorse and turn the wretched inmates out at midnight into the streets to die of exposure terror and despair they would stop at once when they came to the church afraid to harm it in any way or to touch the least thing that it contained accordingly while every thing else in a conquered town was doomed to the most reckless destruction all that was in the church the most delicate paintings and the most costly gold and silver images and utensils were as safe as if they were surrounded by impregnable castle walls of course these notions were very mistaken ones according to the teachings of our lord and saviour jesus christ it must be a greater sin to burn down the cottage of a poor widow and turn her out at midnight into the streets to die than to plunder for gain the richest altar in the world from these and various other similar causes it happened that in the middle ages that is from five hundred to a thousand years ago almost all the great expenditures of money in all the great cities and towns of europe were made for churches sometimes these churches were so

nation for the exercise of equal political rights and not to be debarred of them by arguments drawn from countries which have been governed as england has not been by a caste the civilisation not of mere book learning but of the heart all that was once meant by manners good breeding high feeling respect for self and respect for others are just as common as far as i have seen among the hand workers of england and scotland as among any other class the only difference is that these qualities develop more early in the richer classes owing to that severe discipline of our public schools which makes mere lads often fit to govern because they have learnt to obey while they develop later generally not till middle age in the classes who have not gone through in their youth that spartan training and who indeed from a mistaken conception of liberty would not endure it for a day this and other social drawbacks which are but too patent retard the manhood of the working classes that it should be so is a wrong for if a citizen have one right above all others to demand anything of his country it is that he should be educated that whatever capabilities he may have in him however small should have their fair and full chance of development but the cause of the wrong is not the existence of a caste or a privileged class or of anything save the plain fact that some men will be always able to pay more for their children s education than others and that those children will inevitably win in the struggle of life meanwhile in this fact is to be found the most weighty if not the only argument against manhood suffrage which would admit many but too many alas who are still mere boys in mind to a reasonable household suffrage it cannot apply the man who being almost certainly married and having children can afford to rent a pound tenement in a town or in the country either has seen quite enough of life and learnt quite enough of it to form a very fair judgment of the man who offers to represent him in parliament because he has learnt not merely something of his own interest or that of his class but what is infinitely more important the difference between the pretender and the honest man the causes of this state of society which is peculiar to britain must be sought far back in the ages it would seem that the distinction between earl and churl the noble and the non noble freeman was crushed out in this island by the two norman conquests that of the anglo saxon nobility by sweyn and canute and that of the anglo danish nobility by william and his frenchmen those two terrible calamities following each other in the short space of fifty years seem to have welded together by a community of suffering all ranks and races at least south of the tweed and when the english rose after the storm they rose as one homogeneous people never to be governed again by an originally alien race the english nobility were from the time of magna charta rather an official nobility than as in most continental countries a separate caste and whatever caste tendencies had developed themselves before the wars of the roses as such are certain to do during centuries of continued wealth and power were crushed out by the great revolutionary events of the next hundred years especially did the discovery of the new world the maritime struggle with spain the outburst of commerce and colonisation during the reigns of elizabeth and james help toward this good result it was in vain for the lord oxford of the day sneering at raleigh s sudden elevation to complain that as on the virginals so in the state jacks went up and heads went down the proudest noblemen were not ashamed to have their ventures on the high seas and to send their younger sons trading or buccaneering under the conduct of low born men like drake who would like to see the gentleman that would not set his hand to a rope and hale and draw with the mariners thus sprang up that respect for even fondness for severe bodily labour which the educated class of no nation save our own has ever felt and which has stood them in such good stead whether at home or abroad thus too sprang up the system of society by which as the ballad sets forth the squire s son might be a prentice good and marry the bailiff s daughter dear that dwelt at islington without tarnishing as he would have done on the continent the scutcheon of his ancestors that which has saved england from a central despotism such as crushed during the eighteenth century every nation on the continent is the very same peculiarity which makes the advent of the masses to a share in political power safe and harmless namely the absence of caste or rather for there is sure to be a moral fact underlying and causing every political fact the absence of that wicked pride which perpetuates caste forbidding those to intermarry whom nature and fact pronounce to be fit mates before god and man these views are not mine only they have been already set forth so much more forcibly by m de tocqueville that i should have thought it unnecessary to talk about them were not the rhetorical phrases caste privileged classes aristocratic exclusiveness and such like bandied about again just now as if they represented facts if there remain in this kingdom any facts which correspond to those words let them be abolished as speedily as possible but that such do remain was not the opinion of the master of modern political philosophy m de tocqueville he expresses his surprise that the fact which distinguishes england from all other

authorship of mr carlyle says mr james russell lowell alluding to these papers we find some not obscure hints of the future man the outward fashion of them is that of the period but they are distinguished by a certain security of judgment remarkable at any time remarkable especially in one so young carlyle in these first essays already shows the influence of his master goethe the most widely receptive of critics in a compact notice of montaigne there is not a word as to his religious scepticism the character is looked at purely from its human and literary sides here is a passage from the article on newfoundland interesting as containing perhaps the earliest germ of the later style the ships intended for the fishery on the southeast coast arrive early in june each takes her station opposite any unoccupied part of the beach where the fish may be most conveniently cured and retains it till the end of the season formerly the master who arrived first on any station was constituted fishing admiral and had by law the power of settling disputes among the other crews but the jurisdiction of those admirals is now happily superseded by the regular functionaries who reside on shore each captain directs his whole attention to the collection of his own cargo without minding the concerns of his neighbour having taken down what part of the rigging is removable they set about their laborious calling and must pursue it zealously their mode of proceeding is thus described by mr anspach a clerical person who lived in the island several years and has since written a meagre and very confused book which he calls a history of it to the new edinburgh review carlyle also contributed two papers one on joanna baillie s metrical legends and one on goethe s faust in the year he made a translation of legendre s geometry to which he prefixed an essay on proportion and the book appeared a year or two afterwards under the auspices of the late sir david brewster a the

left to take a little repose the man of fancy now discerned another guest who stood so quietly in the shadow of one of the pillars that he might easily have been overlooked my dear sir exclaimed the host grasping him warmly by the hand allow me to greet you as the hero of the evening pray do not take it as an empty compliment for if there were not another guest in my castle it would be entirely

virtue and if his enemies are to be credited of no less remarkable weaknesses and defects with a generosity with which he alone sets us an example we will glance merely at his nobler attributes he it is then who prefers the interests of others to his own and a humble station to an exalted one careless of fashion custom the opinions of men and the influence of the press he assimilates his life to

country he is thoroughly versed in all the languages of the day and can express himself quite as much to the purpose in english as in any other tongue no sooner were the ceremonies of salutation over

assured the man of fancy that he would not fail to circulate in the society of the lower world a minute description of this magnificent castle in the air and of the festivities at which he had the honor to be a guest so saying monsieur on dit made his bow and hurried from one to another of the company with all of whom he seemed to be acquainted and to possess some topic of interest or amusement for every individual coming at last to the oldest inhabitant who was slumbering comfortably in the easy chair he applied his mouth to that venerable ear what do you say cried the old gentleman starting from his nap and putting up his hand to serve the purpose of an ear trumpet monsieur on dit bent forward again and repeated his communication never within my memory exclaimed the oldest inhabitant lifting his hands in astonishment has so remarkable an incident been heard of now came in the clerk of the weather who had been invited out of deference to his official station although the host was well aware that his conversation was likely to contribute but little to the general enjoyment he soon indeed got into a corner with his acquaintance of long ago the oldest inhabitant and began to compare notes with him in reference to the great storms gales of wind and other atmospherical facts that had occurred during a century past it rejoiced the man of fancy that his venerable and much respected guest had met with so congenial an associate entreating them both to make themselves perfectly at home he now turned to receive the wandering jew this personage however had latterly grown so common by mingling in all sorts of society and appearing at the beck of every entertainer that he could hardly be deemed a proper guest in a very exclusive circle besides being covered with

proprietor of the chateau which had so attracted his admiration and was equally surprised and pleased at hearing in reply a nobleman named whom we shall call lord woodville how fortunate much of browne s early recollections both at school and at college had been connected with young woodville whom by a few questions he now ascertained to be the same with the owner of this fair domain he had been raised to the peerage by the decease of his father a few months before and as the general learned from the landlord the term of mourning being ended was now taking possession of his paternal estate in the jovial season of merry autumn accompanied by a select party of friends to enjoy the sports of a country famous for game this was delightful news to our traveller frank woodville had been richard browne s fag at eton and his chosen intimate at christ church their pleasures and their tasks had been the same and the honest soldier s heart warmed to find his early friend in possession of so delightful a residence and of an estate as the landlord assured him with a nod and a wink fully adequate to maintain and add to his dignity nothing was more natural than that the traveller should suspend a journey which there was nothing to render hurried to pay a visit to an old friend under such agreeable circumstances the fresh horses therefore had only the brief task of conveying the general s travelling carriage to woodville castle a porter admitted them at a modern gothic lodge built in that style to correspond with the castle itself and at the same time rang a bell to give warning of the approach of visitors apparently the sound of the bell had suspended the separation of the company bent on the various amusements of the morning for on entering the court of the chateau several young men were lounging about in their sporting dresses looking at and criticizing the dogs which the keepers held in readiness to attend their pastime as general browne alighted the young lord came to the gate of the hall and for an instant gazed as at a stranger upon the countenance of his friend on which war with its fatigues and its wounds had made a great alteration but the uncertainty lasted no longer than till the visitor had spoken and the hearty greeting which followed was such as can only be exchanged betwixt those who have passed together the merry days of careless boyhood or early youth if i could have formed a wish my dear browne said lord woodville it would have been to have you here of all men upon this occasion which my friends are good enough to hold as a sort of holiday do not think you have been unwatched during the years you have been absent from us i have traced you through your dangers your triumphs your misfortunes and was delighted to see that whether in victory or defeat the name of my old friend was always distinguished with applause the general made a suitable reply and congratulated his friend on his new dignities and the possession of a place and domain so beautiful nay you have seen nothing of it as yet said lord woodville and i trust you do not mean to leave us till you are better acquainted with it it is true i confess that my present party is pretty large and the old house like other places of the kind does not possess so much accommodation as the extent of the outward walls appears to promise but we can give you a comfortable old fashioned room and i venture to suppose that your campaigns have taught you to be glad of worse quarters the general shrugged his shoulders and laughed i presume he said the worst apartment in your chateau is considerably superior to the old tobacco cask in which i was fain to take up my night s lodging when i was in the bush as the virginians call it with the light corps there i lay like diogenes himself so delighted with my covering from the elements that i made a vain attempt to have it rolled on to my next quarters but my commander for the time would give way to no such luxurious provision and i took farewell of my beloved cask with tears in my eyes well then since you do not fear your quarters said lord woodville you will stay with me a week at least of guns dogs fishing rods flies and means of sport by sea and land we have enough and to spare you cannot pitch on an amusement but we will find the means of pursuing it but if you prefer the gun and pointers i will go with you myself and see whether you have mended your shooting since you have been amongst the indians of the back settlements the general gladly accepted his friendly host s proposal in all its points after a morning of manly exercise the company met at dinner where it was the delight of lord woodville to conduce to the display of the high properties of his recovered friend so as to recommend him to his guests most of whom were persons of distinction he led general browne to speak of the scenes he had witnessed and as every word marked alike the brave officer and the sensible man who retained possession of his cool judgment under the most imminent dangers the company looked upon the soldier with general respect as on one who had proved himself possessed of an uncommon portion of personal courage that attribute of all others of which everybody desires to be thought possessed the day at woodville castle ended as usual in such mansions the hospitality stopped within the limits of good order music in which the young lord was a proficient succeeded to the circulation of the bottle cards and billiards for those who preferred such amusements were in readiness but the

which it would have acted but for the misuse of words and signs the instruments of its own creation by signs i would be understood in a wide sense including what is properly meant by that term and what i peculiarly mean in this latter sense almost all familiar objects are signs standing not for themselves but for others in their capacity of suggesting one thought which shall lead to a train of thoughts our whole life is thus an education of error let us recollect our sensations as children what a distinct and intense apprehension had we of the world and of ourselves many of the circumstances of social life were then important to us which are now no longer so but that is not the point of comparison on which i mean to insist we less habitually distinguished all that we saw and felt from ourselves they seemed as it were to constitute one mass there are some persons who in this respect are always children those who are subject to the state called reverie feel as if their nature were dissolved into the surrounding universe or as if the surrounding universe were absorbed into their being they are conscious of no distinction and these are states which precede or accompany or follow an unusually intense and vivid apprehension of life as men grow up this power commonly decays and they become mechanical and habitual agents thus feelings and then reasonings are the combined result of a multitude of entangled thoughts and of a series of what are called impressions planted by reiteration the view of life presented by the most refined deductions of the intellectual philosophy is that of unity nothing exists but as

means of acquitting myself both of my duty and obligation to my departed friend what kinder office lies in me to do to these his most valuable and imperishable remains than to commit them to the protection and lodge them under the roof of a patron whose hospitality has extended itself even to his dust if i would permit myself to run on in the way which so fairly opens itself before me i should tire your grace with reiterated praises and acknowledgments and i might possibly notwithstanding my pretended right so to do give some handle to such who are inclinable to censure to tax me of affectation and officiousness in thanking you more than comes to my share for doing a thing which is in truth of a public consideration as it is doing an honour to your country for so unquestionably it is to do honour to him who was an honour to it i have but one thing to say either to obviate or to answer such an objection if it shall be made to me which is that i loved mr dryden i have not touched upon any other public honour or bounty done by you to your country i have industriously declined entering upon a theme of so extensive a nature and of all your numerous and continual largesses to the public i have only singled out this as what most particularly affected me i confess freely to your grace i very much admire all those other donations but i much more love this and i cannot help it if i am naturally more delighted with any thing that is amiable than with any thing that is wonderful whoever shall censure me i dare be confident you my lord will excuse me for any thing that i shall say with due regard to a gentleman for whose person i had as just an affection as i have an admiration of his writings and indeed mr dryden had personal qualities to challenge both love and esteem from all who were truly acquainted with him he was of a nature exceedingly humane and compassionate easily forgiving injuries and capable of a prompt and sincere reconciliation with them who had offended him such a temperament is the only solid foundation of all moral virtues and sociable endowments his friendship where he professed it went much beyond his professions and i have been told of strong and generous instances of it by the persons themselves who received them though his hereditary income was little more than a bare competency as his reading had been very extensive so was he very happy in a memory tenacious of every thing that he had read he was not more possessed of knowledge than he was communicative of it but then his communication of it was by no means pedantic or imposed upon the conversation but just such and went so far as by the natural turns of the discourse in which he was engaged it was necessarily promoted or required he was extreme ready and gentle in his correction of the errors of any writer who thought fit to consult him and full as ready and patient to admit of the reprehension of others in respect of his own oversight or mistakes he was of very easy i may say of very pleasing access but something slow and as it were diffident in his advances to others he had something in his nature that abhorred intrusion into any society whatsoever indeed it is to be regretted that he was rather blameable in the other extreme for by that means he was personally less known and consequently his character might become liable both to misapprehensions and misrepresentations to the best of my knowledge and observation he was of all the men that ever i knew one of the most modest and the most easily to be discountenanced in his approaches either to his superiors or his equals i have given your grace this slight sketch of his personal character as well to vindicate his memory as to justify myself for the love which i bore to his person and i have the rather done it because i hope it may be acceptable to you to know that he was worthy of the distinction you have shewn him as a man as well as an author as to his writings i shall not take upon me to speak of them for to say little of them would not be to do them right and to say all that i ought to say would be to be very voluminous but i may venture to say in general terms that no man hath written in our language so much and so various matter and in so various manners so well another thing i may say very peculiar to him which is that his parts did not decline with his years but that he was an improving writer to his last even to near seventy years of age improving even in fire and imagination as well as in judgment witness his ode on st cecilia s day and his fables his latest performances he was equally excellent in verse and in prose his prose had all the clearness imaginable together with all the nobleness of expression all the graces and ornaments proper and peculiar to it without deviating into the language or diction of poetry i make this observation only to distinguish his style from that of many poetical writers who meaning to write har

made acquainted resolves to commit his castle dominions and lady to the vassal who should pledge him to keep watch over them till the seven years of his pilgrimage were accomplished his chamberlain an elderly and a cautious man declines the trust observing that seven days instead of seven years would be the utmost space to which he would consent to pledge himself for the fidelity of any woman the esquire of the noble moringer confidently accepts the trust refused by the chamberlain and the baron departs on his pilgrimage the seven years are now elapsed all save a single day and night when behold a vision descends on the noble pilgrim as he sleeps in the land of the stranger it was the noble moringer within an orchard slept when on the baron s slumbering sense a boding vision crept and whispered in his ear a voice tis time sir knight to wake thy lady and thy heritage another master take thy tower another banner knows thy steeds another rein and stoop them to another s will thy gallant vassal train and she the lady of thy love so faithful once and fair this night within thy father s hall she weds marstetten s heir the moringer starts up and prays to his patron st thomas to rescue him from the impending shame which his devotion to his patron had placed him in danger of incurring st thomas who must have felt the justice of the imputation performs a miracle the moringer s senses were drenched in oblivion and when he waked he lay in a well known spot of his own domain on his right the castle of his fathers and on his left the mill which as usual was built not far distant from the castle he leaned upon his pilgrim s staff and to the mill he drew so altered was his goodly form that none their master knew the baron to the miller said good friend for charity tell a poor pilgrim in your land what tidings may there be the miller answered him again he knew of little news save that the lady of the land did a new bridegroom choose her husband died in distant land such is the constant word his death sits heavy on our souls he was a worthy lord of him i held the little mill which wins me living free god rest the baron in his grave he aye was kind to me and when

proper but an association of states in the nature of contract merely can it as a contract be peaceably unmade by less than all the parties who made it one party to a contract may violate it break it so to speak but does it not require all to lawfully rescind it descending from these general principles we find the proposition that in legal contemplation the union is perpetual confirmed by the history of the union itself the union is much older than the constitution it was formed in fact by the articles of association in it was matured and continued by the declaration of independence in it was further matured and the faith of all the then thirteen states expressly plighted and engaged that it should be perpetual by the articles of confederation in and finally in one of the declared objects for ordaining and establishing the constitution was to form a more perfect union but if the destruction of the union by one or by a part only of the states be lawfully possible the union is less perfect than before the constitution having lost the vital element of perpetuity it follows from these views that no state upon its own mere motion can lawfully get out of the union that resolves and ordinances to that effect are legally void and that acts of violence within any state or states against the authority of the united states are insurrectionary or revolutionary according to circumstances i therefore consider that in view of the constitution and the laws the union is unbroken and to the extent of my ability i shall take care as the constitution itself expressly enjoins upon me that the laws of the union be faithfully executed in all the states doing this i deem to be only a simple duty on my part and i shall perform it so far as practicable unless my rightful masters the american people shall withhold the requisite means or in some authoritative manner direct the contrary i trust this will not be regarded as a menace but only as the declared purpose of the union that it will constitutionally defend and maintain itself in doing this there needs to be no bloodshed or violence and there shall be none unless it be forced upon the national authority the power confided to me will be used to hold occupy and possess the property and places belonging to the government and to collect the duties and imposts but beyond what may be necessary for these objects there will be no invasion no using of force against or among the people anywhere where hostility to the united states in any interior locality shall be so great and universal as to prevent competent resident citizens from holding the federal offices there will be no attempt to force obnoxious strangers among the people for that object while the strict legal right may exist in the government to enforce the exercise of these offices the attempt to do so would be so irritating and so nearly impracticable withal that i deem it better to forego for the time the uses of such offices the mails unless repelled will continue to be furnished in all parts of the union so far as possible the people everywhere shall have that sense of perfect security which is most favorable to calm thought and reflection the course here indicated will be followed unless current events and experience shall show a modification or change to be proper and in every case and exigency my best discretion will be exercised according to circumstances actually existing and with a view and a hope of a peaceful solution of the national troubles and the restoration of fraternal sympathies and affections that there are persons in one section or another who seek to destroy the union at all events and are glad of any pretext to do it i will neither affirm nor deny but if there be such i need address no word to them to those however who really love the union may i not speak before entering upon so grave a matter as the destruction of our national fabric with all its benefits its memories and its hopes would it not be wise to ascertain precisely why we do it will you hazard so desperate a step while there is any possibility that any portion of the ills you fly from have no real existence will you while the certain ills you fly to are greater than all the real ones you fly from will you risk the commission of so fearful a mistake all profess to be content in the union if all constitutional rights can be maintained is it true then that any right plainly written in the constitution has been denied i think not happily the human mind is so constituted that no party can reach to the audacity of doing this think if you can of a single instance in which a plainly written provision of the constitution has ever been denied if by the mere force of numbers a majority should deprive a minority of any clearly written constitutional right it might in a moral point of view justify revolution certainly would if such a right were a vital one but such is not our case all the vital rights of minorities and of individuals are so plainly assured to them by affirmations and negations guaranties and prohibitions in the constitution that controversies never arise concerning them but no organic law can ever be framed with a provision specifically applicable to every question which may occur in practical administration no foresight can anticipate nor any document of reasonable length contain express provisions for all possible questions shall fugitives from labor be surrendered by national or state authority the constitution does not expressly say may congress

the bottom which are dead and dry these rollo cut off and lucy and nathan dragged them out and put them on the fire when he had kindled it the fire was a little way from the table with the carpet of hemlock boughs between there was a high hill covered with snow at a little distance and after they had eaten their luncheon rollo said o lucy we will play go up the mountains there is a hill for us that shall be chimborazo well said lucy if you will cut us some long staves accordingly rollo went into the wood and selected some tall and slender young trees about an inch in diameter and cut two for lucy two for nathan and two for himself these he trimmed up smoothly and each of the children took one in each hand they played that rollo was the guide and lucy was the philosopher nathan was the philosopher s servant rollo conducted them safely to the summit but just after they got there it began to snow the snow descended in large flakes and rollo was delighted to see it but lucy seemed a little anxious she said that if there should be much snow it would make it hard for nathan to get home and she thought that they had better go down the mountain immediately and set out for home rollo was rather unwilling to go but he allowed himself to be persuaded and so they all came down the mountain together they packed up their things as quick as they could leaving the fire to burn itself out only rollo first piled on all the hemlock branches which made a great crackling the snow began to fall faster the air was full of the large flakes which floated slowly down and lodged gently upon the old snow the children went along very successfully for some time but at length rollo lost his way the air was so full of snow flakes that he could see only a very little way before him and the old snow covered the ground so as to hide all the old marks and to alter the general aspect of the fields so much that rollo was completely lost he however did not say anything about it but wandered on lucy and nathan wondering all the while why they did not get home until at length they came across a track in the snow o see this track said rollo here is a track where somebody else has been along with a sled yes said lucy some boys who have gone out to slide perhaps the track was partly obliterated by the snow which had fallen upon it since the boys that made it had gone along rollo wondered whose track it could be he said that he thought it very probable it was henry s lucy thought that it might be the track of some children that had gone out to find them at any rate said rollo we will follow the track a little way and see what it leads to perhaps we shall overtake the boys accordingly rollo turned along in the track but lucy stopped no rollo said she we must go the other way if we want to find the boys the track is going the other way but never mind she added i don t want to find the boys i want to go home so we will go this way rollo went on secretly pleased to find the track for he supposed that by retracing it as he was doing it would lead him back home he had however a great curiosity to know who could have made it and in fact the mystery was soon unraveled for after following the track a short distance they saw before them a large dark spot upon the snow and on drawing near to it to see what it was they found it was the place of their own encampment and the track which they were following was their own track leading them back to the mouldering remains of their own fire they had gone round in a great circle and come back upon their own course rollo looked exceedingly blank and confused at this unexpected termination of the clew which he had hoped was to have led him out of his difficulty what he was to do now he did not know the fact however that they were lost was no longer to be concealed and lucy proposed that they should go into the woods where the tops of the trees would act as a sort of umbrella to keep the snow from falling upon them and wait there until it stopped snowing and then the air would be clear and they could find their way out o said rollo i can easily make a hut of hemlock branches and we can go into that for shelter but rollo said nathan how do you know but that it will snow all day we can t stay in the woods all day no said rollo when it snows in great flakes it is not going to snow long jonas told me so so the children went into the woods and rollo began to make his hut but he was soon interrupted and the attention of all the children was called off by a little bird which they saw there hopping about and appearing benumbed with cold after some effort rollo succeeded in catching her in his cap we ll carry her home said nathan we ll carry her home and show her to mother yes said rollo i ll carry her in my cap no said lucy you must have your cap on your head or you will take cold let me carry her in my hands no said rollo you will have to lead nathan i ll tell you what we will do we will put her into the basket for a cage lucy on the whole liked this plan and they accordingly put the bird in the basket and rollo contrived to make a cover of boughs to keep her from getting away by the time that this was all arranged the children found to their great satisfaction that it had ceased snowing and they immediately set out for home rollo drew the sled with the basket and bird upon it secured as before with the cord and lucy led nathan they now had no difficulty in finding their way and soon reached home in safety they kept the bird until the next day and then as it was mild and pleasant they

samuel was devoted to the worship in the temple by his parents you must regard him as a being separated from the rest of the world in childhood in boyhood you must surround him with the pious and virtuous and protect him to the utmost of your power from the sight or hearing of any crime in word or action he must be educated in religious and moral principles of the strictest description let him not enter the world lest he learn to partake of its follies or perhaps of its vices in short preserve him as far as possible from all sin save that of which too great a portion belongs to all the fallen race of adam with the approach of his twenty first birthday comes the crisis of his fate if he survive it he will be happy and prosperous on earth and a chosen vessel among those elected for heaven but if it be otherwise the astrologer stopped and sighed deeply sir replied the parent still more alarmed than before your words are so kind your advice so serious that i will pay the deepest attention to your behests but can you not aid me farther in this most important concern believe me i will not be ungrateful i require and deserve no gratitude for doing a good action said the stranger in especial for contributing all that lies in my power to save from an abhorred fate the harmless infant to whom under a singular conjunction of planets last night gave life there is my address you may write to me from time to time concerning the progress of the boy in religious knowledge if he be bred up as i advise i think it will be best that he come to my house at the time when the fatal and decisive period approaches that is before he has attained his twenty first year complete if you send him such as i desire i humbly trust that god will protect his own through whatever strong temptation his fate may subject him to he then gave his host his address which was a country seat near a post town in the south of england and bid him an affectionate farewell the mysterious stranger departed but his words remained impressed upon the mind of the anxious parent he lost his lady while his boy was still in infancy this calamity i think had been predicted by the astrologer and thus his confidence which like most people of the period he had freely given to the science was riveted and confirmed the utmost care therefore was taken to carry into effect the severe and almost ascetic plan of education which the sage had enjoined a tutor of the strictest principles was employed to superintend the youth s education he was surrounded by domestics of the most established character and closely watched and looked after by the anxious father himself the years of infancy childhood and boyhood passed as the father could have wished a young nazarene could not have been bred up with more rigour all that was evil was withheld from his observation he only heard what was pure in precept he only witnessed what was worthy in practice but when the boy began to be lost in the youth the attentive father saw cause for alarm shades of sadness which gradually assumed a darker character began to over cloud the young man s temper tears which seemed involuntary broken sleep moonlight wanderings and a melancholy for which he could assign no reason seemed to threaten at once his bodily health and the stability of his mind the astrologer was consulted by letter and returned for answer that this fitful state of mind was but the commencement of his trial and that the poor youth must undergo more and more desperate struggles with the evil that assailed him there was no hope of remedy save that he showed steadiness of mind in the study of the scriptures he suffers continued the letter of the sage from the awakening of those harpies the passions which have slept with him as with others till the period of life which he has now attained better far better that they torment him by ungrateful cravings than that he should have to repent having satiated them by criminal indulgence the dispositions of the young man were so excellent that he combated by reason and religion the fits of gloom which at times overcast his mind and it was not till he attained the commencement of his twenty first year that they assumed a character which made his father tremble for the consequences it seemed as if the gloomiest and most hideous of mental maladies was taking the form of religious despair still the youth was gentle courteous affectionate and submissive to his father s will and resisted with all his power the dark suggestions which were breathed into his mind as it seemed by some emanation of the evil principle exhorting him like the wicked wife of job to curse god and die the time at length arrived when he was to perform what was then thought a long and somewhat perilous journey to the mansion of the early friend who had calculated his nativity his road lay through several places of interest and he enjoyed the amusement of travelling more than he himself thought would have been possible thus he did not reach the place of his destination till noon on the day preceding his birthday it seemed as if he had been carried away with an unwonted tide of pleasurable sensation so as to forget in some degree what his father had communicated concerning the purpose of his journey he halted at length before a respectable but solitary old mansion to which he was directed as the abode of his father s friend the servants who came to take his horse told him he had been expected for two days he was led into a study where the stranger now a venerable

the foregoing prediction may seem the facts of the last half century will we think justify it if the manhattan towns or manhattan as we shall not scruple to term the several places that compose the prosperous sisterhood at the mouth of the hudson a name that is more ancient and better adapted to the history associations and convenience of the place than any other continue to prosper as they have done ere the close of the present century they will take their station among the capitals of the first rank it may require a longer period to collect the accessories of a first class place for these are the products of time and cultivation though the facilities of intercourse the spirit of the age and the equalizing sentiment that marks the civilization of the epoch will greatly hasten everything in the shape of improvement new york will probably never possess any churches of an architecture to attract attention for their magnitude and magnificence the policy of the country which separates religion from the state precludes this by confining all the expenditures of this nature to the several parishes few of which are rich enough to do more than erect edifices of moderate dimensions and cost the romish church so much addicted to addressing the senses manifests some desire to construct its cathedrals but they are necessarily confined to the limits and ornaments suited to the resources of a branch of the church that in this country is by no means affluent the manner in which the americans are subdivided into sects also conflicts with any commendable desire that may exist to build glorious temples in honor of the deity and convenience is more consulted than taste perhaps in all that relates to ecclesiastical architecture nevertheless a sensible improvement in this respect has occurred within the last few years to which we shall elsewhere advert it will be in their trade their resources their activity and their influence on the rest of the world as well as in their population that the towns of manhattan will be first entitled to rank with the larger capitals of europe so obvious rapid and natural has been the advance of all the places that it is not easy for the mind to regard anything belonging to them as extraordinary or out of rule there is not a port in the whole country that is less indebted to art and the fostering hand of government than this it is true certain forts most of them of very doubtful necessity have been constructed for defence but no attack having ever been contemplated or if contemplated attempted they have been dead letters in the history of its progress we are not aware that government has ever expended one cent in the waters of manhattan except for the surveys construction of the aforesaid military works and the erection of the lighthouses that form a part of the general provision for the safe navigation of the entire coast some money has been expended for the improvement of the shallow waters of the hudson but it has been as much or more for the advantage of the upper towns and the trade coastwise generally than for the special benefit of new york the immense natural advantages of the bays and islands at the mouth of the hudson have in a great degree superseded the necessity of such assistance nature has made every material provision for a mart of the first importance and perhaps it has been fortunate that the towns have been left like healthful and vigorous children managed by prudent parents to take the inclination and growth pointed out to them by this safest and best of guides london is indebted to artificial causes in a great degree for its growth and power that great law of trade which renders settling places indispensable has contributed to her prosperity and continued ascendency long after the day when rival ports are carrying away her fleets and commerce she is a proof of the difficulty of shaking a commercial superiority long established scarce a cargo that enters the ports of the kingdom that does not pay tribute to her bankers or merchants but london is a political capital and that in a country where the representation of the government is more imposing possessing greater influence than in any other christian nation the english aristocracy which wields the real authority of the state here makes its annual exhibition of luxury and wealth such as the world has never beheld anywhere else ancient rome possibly excepted and has had a large share in rendering london what it is new york has none of this adventitious aid both of the governments that of the united states and that of the state have long been taken from her leaving her nothing of this sort but her own local authorities but representation forms no part of the machinery of american policy it is supposed that man is too intellectual and philosophical to need it in this intellectual and philosophical country par excellence although such is the theory the whole struggle in private life is limited to the impression made by representation in the hands of individuals that which the government has improvidently cast aside society has seized upon and hundreds who have no claim to distinction beyond the possession of money profit by the mistake to place themselves in positions perhaps that they are not always exactly qualified to fill of all social usurpations that of mere money is the least tolerable as one may have a very full purse with empty brains and vulgar tastes and habits the wisdom of thus throwing the control of a feature of society that is of much more moment than is commonly supposed into the chapter of commercial accidents may well he questioned some crude attempts have been made to bring the circles of new york within the control of a code prepared and promulgated through the public press they who have made these a

of preparing tumblers of punch others sitting at the windows of different parlors some with faces flushed puffing cigars the bill of fare for the day was stuck up beside the bar opposite this principal hotel there was another called the mechanics which seemed to be equally thronged i suspect that the company were about on a par in each for at the maverick house though well dressed they seemed to be merely sunday gentlemen mostly young fellows clerks in dry goods stores being the aristocracy of them one very fashionable in appearance with a handsome cane happened to stop by me and lift up his foot and i noticed that the sole of his boot which was exquisitely polished was all worn out i apprehend that some such minor deficiencies might have been detected in the general showiness of most of them there were girls too but not pretty ones nor on the whole such good imitations of gentility as the young men there were as many people as are usually collected at a muster or on similar occasions lounging about without any apparent enjoyment but the observation of this may serve me to make a sketch of the mode of spending the sabbath by the majority of unmarried young middling class people near a great town most of the people had smart canes and bosom pins crossing the ferry into boston we went to the city tavern where the bar room presented a sabbath scene of repose stage folk lounging in chairs half asleep smoking cigars generally with clean linen and other niceties of apparel to mark the day the doors and blinds of an oyster and refreshment shop across the street were closed but i saw people enter it there were two owls in a back court visible through a window of the bar room speckled gray with dark blue eyes the queerest looking birds that exist so solemn and wise dozing away the day much like the rest of the people only that they looked wiser than any others their hooked beaks looked like hooked noses a dull scene this a stranger here and there poring over a newspaper many of the stage folk sitting in chairs on the pavement in front of the door we went to the top of the hill which formed part of gardiner greene s estate and which is now in the process of levelling and pretty much taken away except the highest point and a narrow path to ascend to it it gives an admirable view of the city being almost as high as the steeples and the dome of the state house and overlooking the whole mass of brick buildings and slated roofs with glimpses of streets far below it was really a pity to take it down i noticed the stump of a very large elm recently felled no house in the city could have reared its roof so high as the roots of that tree if indeed the church spires did so on our drive home we passed through charlestown stages in abundance

a dress of the pattern of a kilmarnock snuff box a stalwart irish gentleman in a green coat and bushy red whiskers is whispering something very agreeable into her ear as is the wont of gentlemen of his nation for her dark eyes kindle her red lips open and give an opportunity to a dozen beautiful pearly teeth to display themselves and glance brightly in the sun while round the teeth and the lips

so is it at steamboat wharves there are differences however after you had left i stood and sympathised with those around me and observed that there is usually more emotion on a wharf than on a platform naturally enough as in the case of long sea voyages partings it may be presumed are for longer periods and dangers are supposed to be greater and more numerous than in land journeys though this is open to question the waiting process too is prolonged even after the warning bell had sent non voyagers ashore they had to stand for a considerable time in the rain while we cast off our moorings or went through some of those incomprehensible processes by which a leviathan steamer is moved out of dock after having made a first false move which separated us about three yards from the wharf inducing the wearied friends on shore to brighten up and smile and kiss hands and wave kerchiefs with that energy of decision which usually marks a really final farewell our steamer remained in that position for full half an hour during which period we gazed from the bulwarks and our friends gazed from under their dripping umbrellas across the now impassable gulf in mute resignation at that moment a great blessing befell us a boy let his cap drop from the wharf into the water it was an insignificant matter in itself but it acted like the little safety valve which prevents the bursting of a high pressure engine voyagers and friends no longer looked at each other like melancholy imbeciles a gleam of intense interest suffused every visage intelligence sparkled in every eye as we turned and concentrated our attention on that cap the unexpressed blessing of the whole company ashore and afloat descended on the uncovered head of that boy who all unconscious of the great end he was fulfilling made frantic and futile efforts with a long piece of stick to recover his lost property but we did at last get under weigh and then there were some touches of real pathos i felt no disposition to note the humorous elements around when i saw that overgrown lad of apparently eighteen summers press to the side and wave his thin hands in adieu to an elderly lady on shore while tears that he could not and evidently did not care to restrain ran down his hollow cheeks he had no friend on board and was being sent to the cape for the benefit of his health so too was another young man somewhere between twenty and thirty years whose high colour brilliant eye and feeble step told their own tale but this man was not friendless his young wife was there and supported him with tender solicitude towards a seat these two were in the after cabin among the steerage passengers the fell disease was represented in the person of a little boy too late was written on the countenances of at least two of these the married man and the little boy as to the healthy passengers what shall i say of them need i tell you that every species of humanity was represented there were tall men and short men as well as men broad and narrow mentally not less than physically there were ladies pretty and ladies plain as well as grave and gay fat and funny ones we had also lean ones and sad the wise and foolish virgins were represented so too were smokers and drinkers and not a few earnest loving and lovable men and women a tendency had been gaining on me of late to believe that after passing middle life a man cannot make new and enthusiastic friendships never was i more mistaken it is now my firm conviction that men may and do make friendships of the closest kind up to the end of their career of course the new friends do not and cannot take the place of the old it seems to me that they serve a higher purpose and by enabling one to realise the difference between the old and the new draw the cords of ancient friendship tighter at all events you may depend upon it my dear periwinkle that no new friend shall ever tumble you out of the niche which you occupy in my bosom but be this as it may it is a fact that in my berth which held four and was full all the voyage there was a tall dark powerful middle aged man an englishman born in cape colony see note who had been home for a trip and was on his way out again to his african home on the great karroo this man raised within me feelings of disgust when i first saw him in the dim light of our berth because he was big and i knew that a big man requires more air to fill his lungs than a little one and there was no superabundant air in our berth quite the reverse this man occupied the top berth opposite to mine each morning as i awoke my eyes fell on his beard of iron grey and i gazed at his placid countenance till he awoke or i found his placid countenance gazing at me when i awoke from gazing to nodding in recognition is an easy step in ordinary circumstances but not when one s head is on one s pillow we therefore passed at once without the ceremony of nodding into a quiet good morning although reticent he gradually added a smile to the good morning and i noticed that his smile was a peculiarly pleasant one steps that succeed the first are generally easy from disliking this man not on personal but purely selfish grounds i came to like him then to love him i have reason to believe that the attachment was mutual his name why should i not state it i don t think he would object is hobson in the bunk below hobson lay a young wesleyan minister he was a slender young fellow modest and thoughtful if hobson s bunk had given way i fear that his modesty and thoughtfulness might have been put to a severe test i looked down

and now he dwells on the change there with wonder at these modern times why have five out of the eleven convenient gates been closed and why above all should the towers have been levelled that were once a glory and defence is the world become so peaceful then and do florentines dwell in such harmony that there are no longer conspiracies to bring ambitious exiles home again with armed bands at their back these are difficult questions it is easier and pleasanter to recognise the old than to account for the new and there flows arno with its bridges just where they used to be the ponte vecchio least like other bridges in the world laden with the same quaint shops where our spirit remembers lingering a little on his way perhaps to look at the progress of that great palace which messer luca pitti had set a building with huge stones got from the hill of bogoli now boboli close behind or perhaps to transact a little business with the cloth dressers in oltrarno the exorbitant line of the pitti roof is hidden from san miniato but the yearning of the old florentine is not to see messer luca s too ambitious palace which he built unto himself it is to be down among those narrow streets and busy humming piazze where he inherited the eager life of his fathers is not the anxious voting with black and white beans still going on down there who are the priori in these months eating soberly regulated official dinners in the palazzo vecchio with removes of tripe and boiled partridges seasoned by practical jokes against the ill fated butt among those potent signors are not the significant banners still hung from the windows still distributed with decent pomp under orcagna s loggia every two months life had its zest for the old florentine when he too trod the marble steps and shared in those dignities his politics had an area as wide as his trade which stretched from syria to britain but they had also the passionate intensity and the detailed practical interest which could belong only to a narrow scene of corporate action only to the members of a community shut in close by the hills and by walls of six miles circuit where men knew each other as they passed in the street set their eyes every day on the memorials of their commonwealth and were conscious of having not simply the right to vote but the chance of being voted for he loved his honours and his gains the business of his counting house of his guild of the public council chamber he loved his enmities too and fingered the white bean which was to keep a hated name out of the borsa with more complacency than if it had been a golden florin he loved to strengthen his family by a good alliance and went home with a triumphant light in his eyes after concluding a satisfactory marriage for his son or daughter under his favourite loggia in the evening cool he loved his game at chess under that same loggia and his biting jest and even his coarse joke as not beneath the dignity of a man eligible for the highest magistracy he had gained an insight into all sorts of affairs at home and abroad he had been of the ten who managed the war department of the eight who attended to home discipline of the priori or signori who were the heads of the executive government he had even risen to the supreme office of gonfaloniere he had made one in embassies to the pope and to the venetians and he had been commissary to the hired army of the republic directing the inglorious bloodless battles in which no man died of brave breast wounds virtuosi colpi but only of casual falls and tramplings and in this way he had learned to distrust men without bitterness looking on life mainly as a game of skill but not dead to traditions of heroism and clean handed honour for the human soul is hospitable and will entertain conflicting sentiments and contradictory opinions with much impartiality it was his pride besides that he was duly tinctured with the learning of his age and judged not altogether with the vulgar but in harmony with the ancients he too in his prime had been eager for the most correct manuscripts and had paid many florins for antique vases and for disinterred busts of the ancient immortals some perhaps truncis naribus wanting as to the nose but not the less authentic and in his old age he had made haste to look at the first sheets of that fine homer which was among the early glories of the florentine press but he had not for all that neglected to hang up a waxen image or double of himself under the protection of the madonna annunziata or to do penance for his sins in large gifts to the shrines of saints whose lives had not been modelled on the study of the classics he had not even neglected making liberal bequests towards buildings for the frati

moment and then entering the shop dragged forth the maker of sugared cream beans and ordered him to lead the way to the presence of the king the confectioner crouching to the earth immediately started off and the prince and princess side by side followed over what seemed to them a very short road to the palace the princess talked a great deal but the prince was rather quiet he had a good many things to think about he was the younger son of a king who lived far away to the north and had been obliged to flee the kingdom on account of the custom of allowing only one full grown heir to the throne to live in the country now thought he this is an excellent commencement of my adventures here is a truly lovely princess whom i am conducting to her anxious parent he will be overwhelmed with gratitude and will doubtless bestow upon me the government of a province or perhaps he will make me his vizier no i will not accept that the province will suit me better having settled this little matter to his mind he gladdened the heart of the princess with the dulcet tones of his gentle voice on reaching the palace they went directly to the grand hall where the king was giving audience justly astounded at perceiving his daughter now veiled approaching under the guidance of a crouching sugar bean maker and a strange young man he sat in silent amazement until the prince who was used to court life had made his manners and related his story when the king had heard it he clapped his hands three times and in rushed twenty four eunuchs take said the monarch this bird to her bower and they surrounded the princess and hurried her off to the women s apartments then he clapped his hands twice and in rushed twenty four armed guards from another door bind me this dog quoth the king

you shall be lodged and feasted daintily and the day after we will have a celebration when you shall be beaten with sticks and shall fight a tiger and be tossed by a bull and be bowstrung and beheaded and drawn and quartered and we will have a nice time bear him away to his soft couch illustration the guards then led the prince away to be kept a prisoner until the day for the celebration the room to which he was conducted was comfortable and he soon had a plenteous supper laid out before him of which he partook with great avidity having finished his meal he sat down to reflect upon his condition but feeling very sleepy and remembering that he would have a whole day of leisure to morrow for such reflections he concluded to go to bed before doing so however he wished to make all secure for the night examining the door he found there was no lock to it and being unwilling to remain all night liable to intrusion he pondered the matter for some minutes and then took up a wide and very heavy stool and having partially opened the door he put the stool up over it resting it partly on the door and partly on the surrounding woodwork so that if any one tried to come in and pushed the door open the stool would fall down and knock the intruder s head off having arranged this to his satisfaction the prince went to bed that evening the princess aufalia was in great grief for she had heard of the sentence pronounced upon the prince and felt herself the cause of it what other reason she had to grieve over the prince s death need not be told her handmaidens fully sympathized with her and one of them nerralina the handsomest and most energetic of them all soon found by proper inquiry that the prince was confined in the fourth story of the tower of tears so they devised a scheme for his rescue each one of the young ladies contributed her scarf and when they were all tied together the conclave decided that they made a rope plenty long enough to reach from the prince s window to the ground thus much settled it only remained to get this means of escape to the prisoner this the lady nerralina volunteered to do waiting until the dead of night she took off her slippers and with the scarf rope rolled up into a ball under her arm she silently stepped past the drowsy sentinels and reaching the prince s room pushed open the door and the stool fell down and knocked her head off her body lay in the doorway but her head rolled into the middle of the room notwithstanding the noise occasioned by this accident the prince did not awake but in the morning when he was up and nearly dressed he was astonished at seeing a lady s head in the middle of the room illustration hallo said he here s somebody s head picking it up he regarded it with considerable interest then seeing the body in the doorway he put the head and it together and finding they fitted came to the conclusion that they belonged to each other and that the stool had done the mischief when he saw the bundle of scarfs lying by the body he unrolled it and soon imagined the cause of the lady s visit poor thing he said doubtless the princess sent her here with this and most likely with a message also which now i shall never hear but these poor women what do they know this rope will not bear a man like me well well this poor girl is dead i will pay respect to her and so he picked her up and put her

exertion and trouble that i this day detected russell s manuscript the account of the murder of sharpe by one of the murderers also kirkton and one or two others which mr mccrie had removed from their

have suffered a work always relied upon as one of their chief authorities to lie dormant for a hundred and forty years their querulous outcries probably from the field work of the christian instructor

truculent than those who actually were testifying even after his decease in the heart of mid lothian scott set himself to draw his own people at their best he had a heroine to his hand in helen walker

steeple the windows are tall and symmetrical the outer doors are resplendent with oak graining the inner doors reverentially noiseless with a garment of red baize and the walls you are convinced no lichen will ever again effect a settlement on they are smooth and innutrient as the summit of the rev amos barton s head after ten years of baldness and supererogatory soap pass through the baize doors and you will see the nave filled with well shaped benches understood to be free seats while in certain eligible corners less directly under the fire of the clergyman s eye there are pews reserved for the shepperton gentility ample galleries are supported on iron pillars and in one of them stands the crowning glory the very clasp or aigrette of shepperton church adornment namely an organ not very much out of repair on which a collector of small rents differentiated by the force of circumstances into an organist will accompany the alacrity of your departure after the blessing by a sacred minuet or an easy gloria immense improvement says the well regulated mind which unintermittingly rejoices in the new police the tithe commutation act the penny post and all guarantees of human advancement and has no moments when conservative reforming intellect takes a nap while imagination does a little toryism by the sly revelling in regret that dear old brown crumbling picturesque inefficiency is everywhere giving place to spick and span new painted new varnished efficiency which will yield endless diagrams plans elevations and sections but alas no picture mine i fear is not a well regulated mind it has an occasional tenderness for old abuses it lingers with a certain fondness over the days of nasal clerks and top booted parsons and has a sigh for the departed shades of vulgar errors so it is not surprising that i recall with a fond sadness shepperton church as it was in the old days with its outer coat of rough stucco its red tiled roof its heterogeneous windows patched with desultory bits of painted glass and its little flight of steps with their wooden rail running up the outer wall and leading to the school children s gallery then inside what dear old quaintnesses which i began to look at with delight even when i was so crude a members of the congregation that my nurse found it necessary to provide for the reinforcement of my devotional patience by smuggling bread and butter into the sacred edifice there was the chancel guarded by two little cherubims looking uncomfortably squeezed between arch and wall and adorned with the escutcheons of the oldinport family which showed me inexhaustible possibilities of meaning in their blood red hands their death s heads and cross bones their leopards paws and maltese crosses there were inscriptions on the panels of the singing gallery telling of benefactions to the poor of shepperton with an involuted elegance of capitals and final flourishes which my alphabetic erudition traced with ever new delight no benches in those days but huge roomy pews round which devout church goers sat during lessons trying to look anywhere else than into each other s eyes no low partitions allowing you with a dreary absence of contrast and mystery to see everything at all moments but tall dark panels under whose shadow i sank with a sense of retirement through the litany only to feel with more intensity my burst into the conspicuousness of public life when i was made to stand up on the seat during the psalms or the singing and the singing was no mechanical affair of official routine it had a drama as the moment of psalmody approached by some process to me as mysterious and untraceable as the opening of the flowers or the breaking out of the stars a slate appeared in front of the gallery advertising in bold characters the psalm about to be sung lest the sonorous announcement of the clerk should still leave the bucolic mind in doubt on that head then followed the migration of the clerk to the gallery where in company with a bassoon two key bugles a carpenter understood to have an amazing power of singing counter and two lesser musical stars he formed the complement of a choir regarded in shepperton as one of distinguished attraction occasionally known to draw hearers from the next parish the innovation of hymn books was as yet undreamed of even the new version was regarded

and clean only as decency might require not nicely clean with feminine care the very stuff of which they were made was brown rather than white and her dress was always the same it was rough and black and clinging disagreeable to the eye in its shape as will always be the dress of any woman which is worn day after day through all hours by nature and education mrs prime was a prim tidy woman but it seemed that her peculiar ideas of duty required her to militate against her nature and education at any rate in appearance and this was her lot in life before she had yet reached her twentieth year dorothea ray had not been wanting in some feminine attraction she had ever been brown and homely but her features had been well formed and her eyes had been bright now as she approached to thirty years of age she might have been as well looking as at any earlier period of her life if it had been her wish to possess good looks but she had had no such wish on the contrary her desire had been to be ugly forbidding unattractive almost repulsive so that in very truth she might be known to be a widow indeed and here i must not be misunderstood there was nothing hypocritical about mrs prime nor did she make any attempt to appear before men to be weighted with a deeper sorrow than that which she truly bore hypocrisy was by no means her fault her fault was this that she had taught herself to believe that cheerfulness was a sin and that the more she became morose the nearer would she be to the fruition of those hopes of future happiness on which her heart was set in all her words and thoughts she was genuine but then in so very many of them she was mistaken this was the wall against which mrs ray had allowed herself to be fastened for many years past and though the support was strong it must be admitted that it could hardly have been at all times pleasant mrs ray had become a widow before she was thirty and she had grieved for her husband with truest sorrow pouring herself out at first in tears and afterwards expending herself in long hours of vain regrets but she had never been rough or hard in her widowhood it had ever been her nature to be soft she was a woman all over and had about her so much of a woman s prettiness that she had not altogether divested herself of it even when her weepers had been of the broadest to obtain favour in men s eyes had never been in her mind since she had first obtained favour in the eyes of him who had been her lord but yet she had never absolutely divested herself of her woman charms of that look half retreating half beseeching which had won the heart of the ecclesiastical lawyer gradually her weeds and her deep heavy crapes had fallen away from her and then without much thought on the matter she dressed herself much as did other women of forty or forty five being driven however on certain occasions by her daughter to a degree of dinginess not by any means rivalling that of the daughter herself but which she would not have achieved had she been left to her own devices she was a sweet tempered good humoured loving timid woman ever listening and believing and learning with a certain aptitude for gentle mirth at her heart which however was always being repressed and controlled by the circumstances of her life she could gossip over a cup of tea and enjoy buttered toast and hot cake very thoroughly if only there was no one near her to whisper into her ear that any such enjoyment was wicked in spite of the sorrows she had suffered she would have taught herself to believe this world to be a pleasant place were it not so often preached into her ears that it is a vale of tribulation in which no satisfaction can abide and it may be said of mrs ray that her religion though it sufficed her tormented her grievously it sufficed her and if on such a subject i may venture to give an opinion i think it was of a nature to suffice her in that great strait for which it had been prepared but in this world it tormented her carrying her hither and thither and leaving her in grievous doubt not as to its own truth in any of its details but as to her own conduct under its injunctions and also as to her own mode of believing in it in truth she believed too much she could never divide the minister from the bible nay the very clerk in the church was sacred to her while exercising his functions therein it never occurred to her to question any word that was said to her if a linen draper were to tell her that one coloured calico was better for her than another she would take that point as settled by the man s word and for the time would be free from all doubt on that heading so also when the clergyman in his sermon told her that she should live simply and altogether for heaven that all thoughts as to this world were wicked thoughts and that nothing belonging to this world could be other than painful full of sorrow and vexations she would go home believing him absolutely and with tear laden eyes would bethink herself how utterly she was a castaway because of that tea and cake and innocent tittle tattle with which the hours of her saturday evening had been beguiled she would weakly resolve that she would laugh no more and that she would live in truth in a valley of tears but then as the bright sun came upon her and the birds sang around her and some one that she loved would cling to her and kiss her she would be happy in her own despite and would laugh with a low musical sweet tone forgetting that such laughter was a sin and then that very clergyman himself would torment her he that told her from the pulpit on sundays how frightfully vain were all attempts at worldly happiness he would come to her on the monday with a good natured rather rubicund face and would ask after all her

is commonly found in the forest it does not appear difficult to identify the exact region of which battell speaks longo is doubtless the name of the place usually spelled loango on our maps mayombe still lies some nineteen leagues northward from loango along the coast and cilongo or kilonga manikesocke and motimbas are yet registered by geographers the cape negro of battell however cannot be the modern cape negro in degrees s since loango itself is in degrees s latitude on the other hand the great river called banna corresponds very well with the camma and fernand vas of modern geographers which form a great delta on this part of the african coast now this camma country is situated about a degree and a half south of the equator while a few miles to the north of the line lies the gaboon and a degree or so north of that the money river both well known to modern naturalists as localities where the largest of man like apes has been obtained moreover at the present day the word engeco or n schego is applied by the natives of these regions to the smaller of the two great apes which inhabit them so that there can be no rational doubt that andrew battell spoke of that which he knew of his own knowledge or at any rate by immediate report from the natives of western africa the engeco however is that other monster whose nature battell forgot to relate while the name pongo applied to the animal whose characters and habits are so fully and carefully described seems to have died out at least in its primitive form and signification indeed there is evidence that not only in battell s time but up to a very recent date it was used in a totally different sense from that in which he employs it for example the second chapter of purchas work which i have just quoted contains a description and historicall declaration of the golden kingdom of guinea etc etc translated from the dutch and compared also with the latin wherein it is stated p that the river gaboon lyeth about fifteen miles northward from rio de angra and eight miles northward from cape de lope gonsalves cape lopez and is right under the equinoctial line about fifteene miles from st thomas and is a great land well and easily to be knowne at the mouth of the river there lieth a sand three or foure fathoms deepe whereon it beateth mightily with the streame which runneth out of the river into the sea this river in the mouth thereof is at least four miles broad but when you are about the iland called pongo it is not above two miles broad on both sides the river there standeth many trees the iland called pongo which hath a monstrous high hill illustration fig the orang of tulpius the french naval officers whose letters are appended to the late m isidore geoff saint hilaire s excellent essay on the gorilla note in similar terms the width of the gaboon the trees that line its banks down to the water s edge and the strong current that sets out of it they describe two islands in its estuary one low called perroquet the other high presenting three conical hills called coniquet and one of them m franquet expressly states that formerly the chief of coniquet was called meni pongo meaning thereby lord of pongo and that the n pongues as in agreement with dr savage he affirms the natives call themselves term the estuary of the gaboon itself n pongo it is so easy in dealing with savages to misunderstand their applications of words to things that one is at first inclined to suspect battell of having confounded the name of this region where his greater monster still abounds with the name of the animal itself but he is so right about other matters including the name of the lesser monster that one is loth to suspect the old traveller of error and on the other hand we shall find that a voyager of a hundred years later date speaks of the name boggoe as applied to a great ape by the inhabitants of quite another part of africa sierra leone but i must leave this question to be settled by philologers and travellers and i should hardly have dwelt so long upon it except for the curious part played by this word pongo in the later history of the man like apes the generation which

standing on a mounting block before the door with one foot in the stirrup the virgin monarch had then and there boxed and cuffed an unlucky page for some neglect of duty the matter of fact and doubtful folks of whom there were a few among the maypole customers as unluckily there always are in every little community were inclined to look upon this tradition as rather apocryphal but whenever the landlord of that ancient hostelry appealed to the mounting block itself as evidence and triumphantly pointed out that there it stood in the same place to that very day the doubters never failed to be put down by a large majority and all true believers exulted as in a victory whether these and many other stories of the like nature were true or untrue the maypole was really an old house a very old house perhaps as old as it claimed to be and perhaps older which will sometimes happen with houses of an uncertain as with ladies of a certain age its windows were old diamond pane lattices its floors were sunken and uneven its ceilings blackened by the hand of time and heavy with massive beams over the doorway was an ancient porch quaintly and grotesquely carved and here on summer evenings the more favoured customers smoked and drank ay and sang many a good song too sometimes reposing on two grim looking high backed settles which like the twin dragons of some fairy tale guarded the entrance to the mansion in the chimneys of the disused rooms swallows had built their nests for many a long year and from earliest spring to latest autumn whole colonies of sparrows chirped and twittered in the eaves there were more pigeons about the dreary stable yard and out buildings than anybody but the landlord could reckon up the wheeling and circling flights of runts fantails tumblers and pouters were perhaps not quite consistent with the grave and sober character of the building but the monotonous cooing which never ceased to be raised by some among them all day long suited it exactly and seemed to lull it to rest with its overhanging stories drowsy little panes of glass and front bulging out and projecting over the pathway the old house looked as if it were nodding in its sleep indeed it needed no very great stretch of fancy to detect in it other resemblances to humanity the bricks of which it was built had originally been a deep dark red but had grown yellow and discoloured like an old man s skin the sturdy timbers had decayed like teeth and here and there the ivy like a warm garment to comfort it in its age wrapt its green leaves closely round the time worn walls it was a hale and hearty age though still and in the summer or autumn evenings when the glow of the setting sun fell upon the oak and chestnut trees of the adjacent forest the old house partaking of its lustre seemed their fit companion and to have many good years of life in him yet the evening with which we have to do was neither a summer nor an autumn one but the twilight of a day

who gives himself entirely to his fellow men appears to them useless and selfish but he who gives himself partially to them is pronounced a benefactor and philanthropist how does it become a man to behave toward the american government today i answer that he cannot without disgrace be associated with it i cannot for an instant recognize that political organization as my government which is the slave s government also all men recognize the right of revolution that is the right to refuse allegiance to and to resist the government when its tyranny or its inefficiency are great and unendurable but almost all say that such is not the case now but such was the case they think in the revolution of if one were to tell me that this was a bad government because it taxed certain foreign commodities brought to its ports it is most probable that i should not make an ado about it for i can do without them all machines have their friction and possibly this does enough good to counter balance the evil at any rate it is a great evil to make a stir about it but when the friction comes to have its machine and oppression and robbery are organized i say let us not have such a machine any longer in other words when a sixth of the population of a nation which has undertaken to be the refuge of liberty are slaves and a whole country is unjustly overrun and conquered by a foreign army and subjected to military law i think that it is not too soon for honest men to rebel and revolutionize what makes this duty the more urgent is that fact that the country so overrun is not our own but ours is the invading army paley a common authority with many on moral questions in his chapter on the duty of submission to civil government resolves all civil obligation into expediency and he proceeds to say that so long as the interest of the whole society requires it that is so long as the established government cannot be resisted or changed without public inconvenience it is the will of god that the established government be obeyed and no longer this principle being admitted the justice of every particular case of resistance is reduced to a computation of the quantity of the danger and grievance on the one side and of the probability and expense of redressing it on the other of this he says every man shall judge for himself but paley appears never to have contemplated those cases to which the rule of expediency does not apply in which a people as well as an individual must do justice cost what it may if i have unjustly wrested a plank from a drowning man i must restore it to him though i drown myself this according to paley would be inconvenient but he that would save his life in such a case shall lose it this people must cease to hold slaves and to make war on mexico though it cost them their existence as a people in their practice nations agree with paley but does anyone think that massachusetts does exactly what is right at the present crisis a drab of stat a cloth o silver slut to have her train borne up and her soul trail in the dirt practically speaking the opponents to a reform in massachusetts are not a hundred thousand politicians at the south but a hundred thousand merchants and farmers here who are more interested in commerce and agriculture than they are in humanity and are not prepared to do justice to the slave and to mexico cost what it may i quarrel not with far off foes but with those who near at home co operate with and do the bidding of those far away and without whom the latter would be harmless we are accustomed to say that the mass of men are unprepared but improvement is slow because the few are not as materially wiser or better than the many it is not so important that many should be good as you as that there be some absolute goodness somewhere for that will leaven the whole lump there are thousands who are in opinion opposed to slavery and to the war who yet in effect do nothing to put an end to them who esteeming themselves children of washington and franklin sit down with their hands in their pockets and say that they know not what to do and do nothing who even postpone the question of freedom to the question of free trade and quietly read the prices current along with the latest advices from mexico after dinner and it may be fall asleep over them both what is the price current of an honest man and patriot today they hesitate and they regret and sometimes they petition but they do nothing in earnest and with effect they will wait well disposed for other to remedy the evil that they may

more claret i won t go to school chapter ii three or four years passed over and the mind of vivian grey astonishingly developed itself he had long ceased to wear frills had broached the subject of boots three or four times made a sad inroad during the holidays in mr grey s bottle of claret and was reported as having once sworn at the butler the young gentleman began also to hint during every vacation that the fellows at flummery s were somewhat too small for his companionship and first bud of puppyism the former advocate of straight hair now expended a portion of his infant income in the purchase of macassar and began to cultivate his curls mrs grey could not entertain for a moment the idea of her son s associating with children the eldest of whom to adopt his own account was not above eight years old so flummery it was determined he should leave but where to go mr grey was for eton but his lady was one of those women whom nothing in the world can persuade that a public school is anything else but a place where boys are roasted alive and so with tears and taunts and supplications the point of private education was conceded at length it was resolved that the only hope should remain at home a season until some plan should be devised for the cultivation of his promising understanding during this year vivian became a somewhat more constant intruder into the library than heretofore and living so much among books he was insensibly attracted to those silent companions that speak so eloquently how far the character of the parent may influence the character of the child the metaphysician must decide certainly the character of vivian grey underwent at this period of his life a sensible change doubtless constant communion with a mind highly refined severely cultivated and much experienced cannot but produce a beneficial impression even upon a mind formed and upon principles developed how infinitely more powerful must the influence of such communion be upon a youthful heart ardent innocent and unpractised as vivian was not to figure in the microcosm of a public school a place for which from his temper he was almost better fitted than any young genius whom the playing fields of eton or the hills of winton can remember there was some difficulty in fixing upon his future academus mr grey s two axioms were first that no one so young as his son should settle in the metropolis and that vivian must consequently not have a private tutor and secondly that all private schools were quite worthless and therefore there was every probability of vivian not receiving any education whatever at length an exception to axiom second started up in the establishment of mr dallas this gentleman was a clergyman a profound grecian and a poor man he had edited the

last exclamation was however a scandalous libel for certainly no being ever stood in a pedagogue s presence with more perfect sang froid and with a bolder front than did at this moment vivian grey one principle in mr dallas s system was always to introduce a new comer in school hours he was thus carried immediately in medias res and the curiosity of his co mates being in a great degree satisfied at the time when that curiosity could not personally annoy him the new comer was of course much better prepared to make his way when the absence of the ruler became a signal for some oral communication with the arrival however in the present instance the young savages at burnsley vicarage had caught a tartar and in a very few days vivian grey was decidedly the most popular fellow in the school he was so dashing so devilish good tempered so completely up to everything the magnates of the land were certainly rather jealous of his success but their very sneers bore witness to his popularity cursed puppy whispered st leger smith thinks himself knowing squeaked johnson secundus thinks himself witty growled barlow primus notwithstanding this cabal days rolled on at burnsley vicarage only to

pursuant to the awards of the commissioners under the act of the d of march if however it should not be deemed advisable to carry that recommendation into effect i would suggest that authority be

unlikely to arise hereafter in the course of our extensive trade with that empire by the act of the th of august last congress authorized the president to instruct the commanders of suitable vessels to defend themselves against and to capture pirates this authority has been exercised in a single instance only for the more effectual protection of our extensive and valuable commerce in the eastern

strength of the army and for recommendations having in view an increase of its efficiency and the well being of the various branches of the service intrusted to his care it is gratifying to know that the patriotism of the people has proved equal to the occasion and that the number of troops tendered greatly exceeds the force which congress authorized me to call into the field i refer with pleasure to those portions of his report which make allusion to the creditable degree of discipline already attained by our troops and to the excellent sanitary condition of the entire army the recommendation of the secretary for an organization of the militia upon a uniform basis is a subject of vital importance to the future safety of the country and is commended to the serious attention of congress the large addition to the regular army in connection with the defection that has so considerably diminished the number of its officers gives peculiar importance to his recommendation for increasing the corps of cadets to the greatest capacity of the military academy by mere omission i presume congress has failed to provide chaplains for hospitals occupied by volunteers this subject was brought to my

a time for which nothing is too surprising a time in which we all ought to be prepared from the least to the greatest to see the greatest horrors and the greatest blessings come suddenly upon us like a thief in the night so much for christ s coming being too wonderful a thing to happen just now still you are right to ask what do you mean by christ s being our king what do you mean by his coming to us what reason have you for supposing that he is coming now rather than at any other time and if he be coming what are we to do what is there we ought to repent of what is there we ought to amend well my friends it is just these very questions which i hope and trust god will help me to answer to you in my next few sermons i am perfectly convinced that we must get them answered and act upon them speedily i am perfectly convinced that if we go on as most of us are going in england now the lord of us all will come in an hour when we are not aware and cut us asunder in the deepest and most real sense as he came and cut asunder france germany and austria only last year and appoint us our portion with the unbelievers and i believe that our punishment will be seven times as severe as that of either france germany or austria because we have had seven times their privileges and blessings seven times their gospel light and christian knowledge seven times their freedom and justice in laws and constitution seven times their wealth and prosperity and means of employing our population much has been given to england and of her much will be required and if you could only see the state of mankind over the greatest part of the globe how infinitely fewer opportunities they have of knowing god s will than you have you would feel that to you poor and struggling as some of you are to you much has been given and of you much will be required now first what do i mean by christ being our king i daresay there are some among you who are inclined to think that when we talk of christ being a king that the word king means something very different from its common meaning and god knows that that is true enough our blessed lord took care to make people understand that how he was not like one of the kings of the nations how his kingdom was not of this world but yet the bible tells us again and again that all good kings all real kings are patterns of christ and therefore that when we talk of christ being a king we mean that he is a king in everything that a king ought to be that he fulfils perfectly all the duties of a king that he is the pattern which all kings ought to copy kings have been in all ages too apt to forget that and indeed so have the people too we english have forgotten most thoroughly in these days that christ is our king or even a king at all we talk of christ being a spiritual king and then we say that that merely means that he is king of christians hearts and when anyone asks what that means it comes out that all we mean is that christ has a very great influence over the hearts of believing christians when he can obtain it or else that it means that he is king of a very small number of people called the elect whom he has chosen out but that he has absolutely nothing to do with the whole rest of the world and then when anyone stands up with the bible in his hand and says in the plain words of scripture christ is not only the king of believers he is the king of the whole earth the king of the clouds and the thunder the king of the land and the cattle and the trees and the corn and to whomsoever he will he giveth them christ is not only the king of believers he is the king of all the king of the wicked of the heathen of those who do not believe him who never heard of him christ is not only the king of a few individual persons one here and one there in every parish but he is the king of every nation he is the king of england by the grace of god just as much as queen victoria is and ten thousand times more if any man talks in this way people stare think him an enthusiast ask him what new doctrine this is and call his words unscriptural just because they come out of scripture and not out of men s perversions and twistings of scripture nevertheless christ is king really and truly king of kings and lord of lords and he will make men know it what he was that he is and ever will be there is no change in him his kingdom is an everlasting kingdom and his dominion endureth throughout all ages and woe unto those small or great who rebel against him but what sort of a king is he he is a king of law and order and justice he is not selfish fanciful self willed he said himself that he came not to do his own will but his father s he is a king of gentleness and meekness too but do not mistake that there is no weak indulgence in him a man may be very meek and yet stern enough and strong enough moses was the meekest of men we read and yet he made those who rebelled against him feel that he was not to be trifled with korah dathan and abiram found that to their cost he would not even spare his own brother aaron his own sister miriam when they rebelled and he was right he showed his love by it indulgence is not love it is no sign of meekness but only of cowardice and carelessness to be afraid to rebuke sin moses knew that he was doing god s work that he was appointed to make a great nation of those slavish besotted jews his countrymen that he was sent by god with boundless blessings to them and woe to whoever hindered him from that because he loved the jews therefore he dared punish those who tempted them to

further that as masters they confer the said authority voluntarily and this implies that they may give or withhold it as they please to call that deputed which is wrenched from men whether they will or not is nonsense but what is here true of all collectively is equally true of each separately as a government can rightly act for the people only when empowered by them so also can it rightly act for the individual only when empowered by him if a b and c debate whether they shall employ an agent to perform for them a certain service and if whilst a and b agree to do so c dissents c cannot equitably be made a party to the agreement in spite of himself and this must be equally true of thirty as of three and if of thirty why not of three hundred or three thousand or three millions of the political superstitions lately alluded to none is so universally diffused as the notion that majorities are omnipotent under the impression that the preservation of order will ever require power to be wielded by some party the moral sense of our time feels that such power cannot rightly be conferred on any but the largest moiety of society it interprets literally the saying that the voice of the people is the voice of god and transferring to the one the sacredness attached to the other it concludes that from the will of the people that is of the majority there can be no appeal yet is this belief entirely erroneous suppose for the sake of argument that struck by some malthusian panic a legislature duly representing public opinion were to enact that all children born during the next ten years should be drowned does any one think such an enactment would be warrantable if not there is evidently a limit to the power of a majority suppose again that of two races living together celts and saxons for example the most numerous determined to make the others their slaves would the authority of the greatest number be in such case valid if not there is something to which its authority must be subordinate suppose once more that all men having incomes under a year were to resolve upon reducing every income above that amount to their own standard and appropriating the excess for public purposes could their resolution be justified if not it must be a third time confessed that there is a law to which the popular voice must defer what then is that law if not the law of pure equity the law of equal freedom these restraints which all would put to the will of the majority are exactly the restraints set up by that law we deny the right of a majority to murder to enslave or to rob simply because murder enslaving and robbery are violations of that law violations too gross to be overlooked but if great violations of it are wrong so also are smaller ones if the will of the many cannot supersede the first principle of morality in these cases neither can it in any so that however insignificant the minority and however trifling the proposed trespass against their rights no such trespass is permissible when we have made our constitution purely democratic thinks to himself the earnest reformer we shall have brought government into harmony with absolute justice such a faith though perhaps needful for the age is a very erroneous one by no process can coercion be made equitable the freest form of government is only the least objectionable form the rule of the many by the few we call tyranny the rule of the few by the many is tyranny also only of a less intense kind you shall do as we will and not as you will is in either case the declaration and if the hundred make it to ninety nine instead of the ninety nine to the hundred it is only a fraction less immoral of two such parties whichever fulfils this declaration necessarily breaks the law of equal freedom the only difference being that by the one it is broken in the persons of ninety nine whilst by the other it is broken in the persons of a hundred and the merit of the democratic form of government consists solely in this that it trespasses against the smallest number the very existence of majorities and minorities is indicative of an immoral state the man whose character harmonises with the moral law we found to be one who can obtain complete happiness without diminishing the happiness of his fellows but the enactment of public arrangements by vote implies a society consisting of men otherwise constituted implies that the desires of some cannot be satisfied without sacrificing the desires of others implies that in the pursuit of their happiness the majority inflict a certain amount of un happiness on the minority implies therefore organic immorality thus from another point of view we again perceive that even in its most equitable form it is impossible for government to dissociate itself from evil and further that unless the right to ignore the state is recognised its acts must be essentially criminal that a man is free to abandon the benefits and throw off the burdens of citizenship may indeed be inferred from the admissions of existing authorities and of current opinion unprepared as they probably are for so extreme a doctrine as the one here maintained the radicals

in soot and grease and other nastiness had acquired great renown in all that country side far greater renown than he could ever have won for himself if his career had been that of any ordinary christian or decent hottentot he had even blanketed and skewered and sooted and greased himself into the london papers and it was curious to find as mr traveller found by stopping for a new direction at this farm house or at that cottage as he went along with how much accuracy the morbid mopes had counted on the weakness of his neighbours to embellish him a mist of home brewed marvel and romance surrounded mopes in which as in all fogs the real proportions of the real object were extravagantly heightened he had murdered his beautiful beloved in a fit of jealousy and was doing penance he had made a vow under the influence of grief he had made a vow under the influence of a fatal accident he had made a vow under the influence of religion he had made a vow under the influence of drink he had made a vow under the influence of disappointment he had never made any vow but had got led into it by the possession of a mighty and most awful secret he was enormously rich he was stupendously charitable he was profoundly learned he saw spectres he knew and could do all kinds of wonders some said he went out every night and was met by terrified wayfarers stalking along dark roads others said he never went out some knew his penance to be nearly expired others had positive information that his seclusion was not a penance at all and would never expire but with himself even as to the easy facts of how old he was or how long he had held verminous occupation of his blanket and skewer no consistent information was to be got from those who must know if they would he was represented as being all the ages between five and twenty and sixty and as having been a hermit seven years twelve twenty thirty though twenty on the whole appeared the favourite term well well said mr traveller at any rate let us see what a real live hermit looks like so mr traveller went on and on and on until he came to tom tiddler s ground it was a nook in a rustic by road which the genius of mopes had laid waste as completely as if he had been born an emperor and a conqueror its centre object was a dwelling house sufficiently substantial all the window glass of which had been long ago abolished by the surprising genius of mopes and all the windows of which were barred across with rough split logs of trees nailed over them on the outside a rickyard hip high in vegetable rankness and ruin contained outbuildings from which the thatch had lightly fluttered away on all the winds of all the seasons of the year and from which the planks and beams had heavily dropped and rotted the frosts and damps of winter and the heats of summer had warped what wreck remained so that not a post or a board retained the position it was meant to hold but everything was twisted from its purpose like its owner and degraded and debased in this homestead of the sluggard behind the ruined hedge and sinking away among the ruined grass and the nettles were the last perishing fragments of certain ricks which had gradually mildewed and collapsed until they looked like mounds of rotten honeycomb or dirty sponge tom tiddler s ground could even show its ruined water for there was a slimy pond into which a tree or two had fallen one soppy trunk and branches lay across it then which in its accumulation of stagnant weed and in its black decomposition and in all its foulness and filth was almost comforting regarded as the only water that could have reflected the shameful place without seeming polluted by that low office mr traveller looked all around him on tom tiddler s ground and his glance at last encountered a dusky tinker lying among the weeds and rank grass in the shade of the dwelling house a rough walking staff lay on the ground by his side and his head rested on a small wallet he met mr traveller s eye without lifting up his head merely depressing his chin a little for he was lying on his back to get a better view of him good day said mr traveller same to you if you like it returned the tinker don t you like it it s a very fine day i ain t partickler in weather returned the tinker with a yawn mr traveller had walked up to where he lay and was looking down at him this is a curious

care if i never see it again there was a man here just now told me what it was called if you want to see tom himself you must go in at that gate he faintly indicated with his chin a little mean ruin of a wooden gate at the side of the house have you seen tom no and i ain t partickler to see him i can see a dirty man anywhere he does not live in the house then said mr traveller casting his eyes upon the house anew the man said returned the tinker rather irritably him as was here just now this what you re a laying on mate is tom tiddler s ground and if you want to see tom he says you must go

landlord was fashionably dressed with the whitest of linen neatly plaited and as courteous as a lord chamberlain visitors from boston thronging the house some standing at the bar watching the process of preparing tumblers of punch others sitting at the windows of different parlors some with faces flushed puffing cigars the bill of fare for the day was stuck up beside the bar opposite this principal hotel there was another called the mechanics which seemed to be equally thronged i suspect that the company were about on a par in each for at the maverick house though well dressed they seemed to be merely sunday gentlemen mostly young fellows clerks in dry goods stores being the aristocracy of them one very fashionable in appearance with a handsome cane happened to stop by me and lift up his foot and i noticed that the sole of his boot which was exquisitely polished was all worn out i apprehend that some such minor deficiencies might have been detected in the general showiness of most of them there were girls too but not pretty ones nor on the whole such good imitations of gentility as the young men there were as many people as are usually collected at a muster or on similar occasions lounging about without any apparent enjoyment but the observation of this may serve me to make a sketch of the mode of spending the sabbath by the majority of unmarried young middling class people near a great town most of the people had smart canes and bosom pins crossing the ferry into boston we went to the city tavern where the bar room presented a sabbath scene of repose stage folk lounging in chairs half asleep smoking cigars generally with clean linen and other niceties of apparel to mark the day the doors and blinds of an oyster and refreshment shop across the street were closed but i saw people enter it there were two owls in a back court visible through a window of the bar room speckled gray with dark blue eyes the queerest looking birds that exist so solemn and wise dozing away the day much like the rest of the people only that they looked wiser than any others their hooked beaks looked like hooked noses a dull scene this a stranger here and there poring over a newspaper many of the stage folk sitting in chairs on the pavement in front of the door we went to the top of the hill which formed part of gardiner greene s estate and which is now in the process of levelling and pretty much taken away except the highest point and a narrow path to ascend to it it gives an admirable view of the city being almost as high as the steeples and the dome of the state house and overlooking the whole mass of brick buildings and slated roofs with glimpses of streets far below it was really a pity to take it down i noticed the stump of a very large elm recently felled no house in the city could have reared its roof so high as the roots of that tree if indeed the church spires did so on our drive home we passed through charlestown stages in abundance

the best arrangement of clauses in a sentence in the proper order of its principal and subordinate propositions in the judicious use of simile metaphor and other figures of speech and even in the rhythmical sequence of syllables ii economy in the use of words the greater forcibleness of saxon english or rather non latin english first claims our attention the several special reasons assignable for this may all be reduced to the general reason economy the most important of them is early association a child s vocabulary is almost wholly saxon he says i have not i possess i wish not i desire he does not reflect he thinks he does not beg for amusement but for play he calls things nice or nasty not pleasant or disagreeable the synonyms which he learns in after years never become so closely so organically connected with the ideas signified as do these original words used in childhood and hence the association remains less strong but in what does a strong association between a word and an idea differ from a weak one simply in the greater ease and rapidity of the suggestive action it can be in nothing else both of two words if they be strictly synonymous eventually call up the same image the expression it is acid must in the end give rise to the same thought as it is sour but because the term acid was learnt later in life and has not been so often followed by the thought symbolized it does not so readily arouse that thought as the term sour if we remember how slowly and with what labour the appropriate ideas follow unfamiliar words in another language and how increasing familiarity with such words brings greater rapidity and ease of comprehension and if we consider that the same process must have gone on with the words of our mother tongue from childhood upwards we shall clearly see that the earliest learnt and oftenest used words will other things equal call up images with less loss of time and energy than their later learnt synonyms the further superiority possessed by saxon english in its comparative brevity obviously comes under the same generalization if it be an advantage to express an idea in the smallest number of words then will it be an advantage to express it in the smallest number of syllables if circuitous phrases and needless expletives distract the attention and diminish the strength of the impression produced then do surplus articulations do so a certain effort though commonly an inappreciable one must be required to recognize every vowel and consonant if as all know it is tiresome to listen to an indistinct speaker or read a badly written manuscript and if as we cannot doubt the fatigue is a cumulative result of the attention needed to catch successive syllables it follows that attention is in such cases absorbed by each syllable and if this be true when the syllables are difficult of recognition it will also be true though in a less degree when the recognition of them is easy hence the shortness of saxon words becomes a reason for their greater force one qualification however must not be overlooked a word which in itself embodies the most important part of the idea to be conveyed especially when that idea is an emotional one may often with advantage be a polysyllabic word thus it seems more forcible to say it is magnificent than it is grand the word vast is not so powerful a one as stupendous calling a thing nasty is not so effective as calling it disgusting there seem to be several causes for this exceptional superiority of certain long words we may ascribe it partly to the fact that a voluminous mouth filling epithet is by its very size suggestive of largeness or strength witness the immense pomposity of sesquipedalian verbiage and when great power or intensity has to be suggested this association of ideas aids the effect a further cause may be that a word of several syllables admits of more emphatic articulation and as emphatic articulation is a sign of emotion the unusual impressiveness of the thing named is implied by it yet another cause is that a long word of which the latter syllables are generally inferred as soon as the first are spoken allows the hearer s consciousness a longer time to dwell upon the quality predicated and where as in the above cases it is to this predicated quality that the entire attention is called an advantage results from keeping it before the mind for an appreciable time the reasons which we have given for preferring short words evidently do not hold here so that to make our generalization quite correct we must say that while in certain sentences expressing strong feeling the word which more especially implies that feeling may often with advantage be a many syllabled or latin one in the immense majority of cases each word serving but as a step to the idea embodied by the whole sentence should if possible be a one syllabled or saxon one once more that frequent cause of strength in saxon and other primitive words their imitative character may be similarly resolved into the more general cause both those directly imitative as splash bang whiz roar c and those analogically imitative as rough smooth keen blunt thin hard crag c have a greater or less likeness to the things symbolized and by making on the senses impressions allied to the ideas to be called up they save part of the effort needed to call up such ideas and leave more attention for the ideas themselves the economy of the recipient s mental energy into which are thus resolvable the several causes of the strength of saxon english may equally be traced in the superiority of specific over generic words that concrete terms produce more vivid impressions than abstract ones and should when possi

to trace how he became possessed of his black vizard which was anciently made in the resemblance of the face of a cat but it seems that the mask was essential to the performance of the character as will appear from the following theatrical anecdote an actor on the italian stage permitted at the foire du st germain in paris was renowned for the wild venturous and extravagant wit the brilliant sallies and fortunate repartees with which he prodigally seasoned the character of the party coloured jester some critics whose good will towards a favourite performer was stronger than their judgment took occasion to remonstrate with the successful actor on the subject of the grotesque vizard they went wilily to their purpose observing that his classical and attic wit his delicate vein of humour his happy turn for dialogue were rendered burlesque and ludicrous by this unmeaning and bizarre disguise and that those attributes would become far more impressive if aided by the spirit of his eye and the expression of his natural features the actor s vanity was easily so far engaged as to induce him to make the experiment he played harlequin barefaced but was considered on all hands as having made a total failure he had lost the audacity which a sense of incognito bestowed and with it all the reckless play of raillery which gave vivacity to his original acting he cursed his advisers and resumed his grotesque vizard but it is said without ever being able to regain the careless and successful levity which the consciousness of the disguise had formerly bestowed perhaps the author of waverley is now about to incur a risk of the same kind and endanger his popularity by having laid aside his incognito it is certainly not a voluntary experiment like that of harlequin for it was my original intention never to have avowed these works during my lifetime and the original manuscripts were carefully preserved though by the care of others rather than mine with the purpose of supplying the necessary evidence of the truth when the period of announcing it should arrive these manuscripts are at present august advertised for public sale which is an addition though a small one to other annoyances but the affairs of my publishers having unfortunately passed into a management different from their own i had no right any longer to rely upon secrecy in that quarter and thus my mask like my aunt dinah s in tristram shandy having begun to wax a little threadbare about the chin it became time to lay it aside with a good grace unless i desired it should fall in pieces from my face which was now become likely yet i had not the slightest intention of selecting the time and place in which the disclosure was finally made nor was there any concert betwixt my learned and respected friend lord meadowbank and myself upon that occasion it was as the reader is probably aware upon the rd february last at a public meeting called for establishing a professional theatrical fund in edinburgh that the communication took place just before we sat down to table lord meadowbank one of the supreme judges of scotland termed lords of council and session asked me privately whether i was still anxious to preserve my incognito on the subject of what were called the waverley novels i did not immediately see the purpose of his lordship s question although i certainly might have been led to infer it and replied that the secret had now of necessity become known to so many people that i was indifferent on the subject lord meadowbank was thus induced while doing me the great honour of proposing my health to the meeting to say something on the subject of these novels so strongly connecting them with me as the author that by remaining silent i must have stood convicted either of the actual paternity or of the still greater crime of being supposed willing to receive indirectly praise to which i had no just title i thus found myself suddenly and unexpectedly placed in the confessional and had only time to recollect that i had been guided thither by a most friendly hand and could not perhaps find a better public opportunity to lay down a disguise which began to resemble that of a detected masquerader i had therefore the task of avowing myself to the numerous and respectable company assembled as the sole and unaided author of these novels of waverley the paternity of which was likely at one time to have formed a controversy of some celebrity for the ingenuity with which some instructors of the public gave their assurance on the subject was extremely persevering i now think it further necessary to say that while i take on myself all the merits and demerits attending these compositions i am bound to acknowledge with gratitude hints of subjects and legends which i have received from various quarters and have occasionally used as a foundation of my fictitious compositions or woven up with them in the shape of episodes i am bound in particular to acknowledge the unremitting kindness of mr joseph train supervisor of excise at dumfries to whose unwearied industry i have been indebted for many curious traditions and points of antiquarian interest it was mr train who brought to my recollection the history of old mortality although i myself had had a personal interview with that celebrated wanderer so far back as about when i found him on his usual task he was then engaged in repairing the gravestones of the covenanters who had died while imprisoned in the castle of dunnottar to which many of them were committed prisoners at the period of argyle s

was said quite won my heart so i sat down on the old cask and told the sailor all my sorrows boy said he when i had finished i ll put you in the way o helpin your mother i can get you a berth in my ship if you re willin to take a trip to the whale fishery of the south seas and who will look after my mother when i m away said i the sailor looked perplexed at the question ah that s a puzzler he replied knocking the ashes out of his pipe will you take me to your mother s house lad willingly said i and jumping up i led the way as we turned to go i observed that the old gentleman with the gold headed cane was leaning over the rail of the pier at a short distance from us a feeling of anger instantly rose within me and i exclaimed loud enough for him to hear i do believe that stingy old chap has been listening to every word we ve been saying i thought i observed a frown on the sailor s brow as i said this but he made no remark and in a few minutes we were walking rapidly through the streets my companion stopped at one of those stores so common in seaport towns where one can buy almost anything from a tallow candle to a brass cannon here he purchased a pound of tea a pound of sugar a pound of butter and a small loaf all of which he thrust into the huge pockets of his coat he had evidently no idea of proportion or of household affairs it was a simple easy way of settling the matter to get a pound of everything in a short time we reached our house a very old one in a poor neighbourhood and entered my mother s room she was sitting at the table when we went in with a large bible before her and a pair of horn spectacles on her nose i could see that she had been out gathering coals and cinders during my absence for a good fire burned in the grate and the kettle was singing cheerily thereon i ve brought a friend to see you mother said i good day mistress said the sailor bluntly sitting down on a stool near the fire you seem to be goin to have your tea i expect to have it soon replied my mother indeed said i in surprise have you anything in the kettle nothing but water my son has anybody brought you anything then since i went out nobody why then mistress broke in the seaman how can you expect to have your tea so soon my mother took off her spectacles looked calmly in the man s face laid her hand on the bible and said because i have been a widow woman these three years and never once in all that time have i gone a single day without a meal when the usual hour came i put on my kettle to boil for this word tells me that the lord will provide i expect my tea to night the sailor s face expressed puzzled astonishment at these words and he continued to regard my mother with a look of wonder as he drew forth his supplies of food and laid them on the table in a short time we were all enjoying a cup of tea and talking about the whale fishery and the difficulty of my going away while my mother was dependent on me at last the sailor rose to leave us taking a five pound note from his pocket he laid it on the table and said mistress this is all i have in the world but i ve got neither family nor friends and i m bound for the south seas in six days so if you ll take it you re welcome to it and if your son bob can manage to cast loose from you without leaving you to sink i ll take him aboard the ship that i sail in he ll always find me at the bull and griffin in the high street or at the end o the pier while the sailor was speaking i observed a figure standing in a dark corner of the room near the door and on looking more closely i found that it was the old gentleman with the nose like his cane knob seeing that he was observed he came forward and said i trust that you will forgive my coming here without invitation but i happened to overhear part of the conversation between your son and this seaman and i am willing to help you over your little difficulty if you will allow me the old gentleman said this in a very quick abrupt way and looked as if he were afraid his offer might be refused he was much heated with climbing our long stair no doubt and as he stood in the middle of the room puffing and wiping his bald head with a handkerchief my mother rose hastily and offered him a chair you are very kind sir she said do sit down sir i m sure i don t know why you should take so much trouble but dear me you are very warm will you take a cup of tea to cool you than

mock us as having less of direct book lore than themselves they should not be able to say that we are without the compensation of knowing a little more of living creatures a clergyman it seems to me should be better able than other men to cast aside that which is merely accidental either in his own character or in the character of the age to which he belongs and to apprehend that which is essential and eternal his acceptance of fixed creeds which belong as much to one generation as another and which have survived amid all changes and convulsions should raise him especially above the temptation to exalt the fashion of his own time or of any past one above the affectation of the obsolete above slavery to the present and above that strange mixture of both which some display who weep because the beautiful visions of the past are departed and admire themselves for being able to weep over them and dispense with them his reverence for the bible should make him feel that we most realise our own personality when we most connect it with that of our fellow men that acts are not to be contemplated apart from the actor that more of what is acceptable to the god of truth may come forth in men striving with infinite confusion and often uttering words like the east wind than in those who can discourse calmly and eloquently about a righteousness and mercy which they know only by hearsay the belief which a minister of god has in the eternity of the distinction between right and wrong should especially dispose him to recognise that distinction apart from mere circumstance and opinion the confidence which he must have that the life of each man and the life of this world is a drama in which a perfectly good and true being is unveiling his own purposes and carrying on a conflict with evil which must issue in complete victory should make him eager to discover in every portion of history in every biography a divine morality and mystery a morality though it deals with no abstract personages a mystery though the subject of it be the doings of the most secular men the subject of this play is certainly a dangerous one it suggests questions which are deeply interesting at the present time it involves the whole character and spirit of the middle ages a person who had not an enthusiastic admiration for the character of elizabeth would not be worthy to speak of her it seems to me that he would be still less worthy if he did not admire far more fervently that ideal of the female character which god has established and not man which she imperfectly realised which often exhibited itself in her in spite of her own more confused though apparently more lofty ideal which may be manifested more simply and therefore more perfectly in the england of the nineteenth century than in the germany of the thirteenth to enter into the meaning of self sacrifice to sympathise with any one who aims at it not to be misled by counterfeits of it not to be unjust to the truth which may be mixed with those counterfeits is a difficult task but a necessary one for any one who takes this work in hand how far our author has attained these ends others must decide i am sure that he will not have failed from forgetting them he has i believe faithfully studied all the documents of the period within his reach making little use of modern narratives he has meditated upon the past in its connection with the present has never allowed his reading to become dry by disconnecting it with what he has seen and felt or made his partial experiences a measure for the acts which they help him to understand he has entered upon his work at least in a true and faithful spirit not regarding it as an amusement for leisure hours but as something to be done seriously if done at all as if he was as much under the great taskmaster s eye in this as in any other duty of his calling in certain passages and scenes he seemed to me to have been a little too bold for the taste and temper of this age but having written them deliberately from a conviction that morality is in peril from fastidiousness and that it is not safe to look at questions which are really agitating people s hearts merely from the outside he has and i believe rightly retained what i should from cowardice have wished him to exclude i have no doubt that any one who wins a victory over the fear of opinion and especially over the opinion of the religious world strengthens his own moral character and acquires a greater fitness for his high service whether poetry is again to revive among us or whether the power is to be wholly stifled by our accurate notions about the laws and conditions under which it is to be exercised is a question upon which there is room for great differences of opinion judging from the past i should suppose that till poetry becomes less self conscious less self concentrated more dramatical in spirit if not in form it will not have the qualities which can powerfully affect englishmen not only were the poets of our most national age dramatists but there seems an evident dramatical tendency in those who wrote what we are wont to call narrative or epic poems take away the dramatic faculty from chaucer and the canterbury tales become indeed what they have been most untruly called mere versions of french or italian fables milton may have been right in changing the form of the paradise lost we are bound to believe that he was right for what appeal can there be against his genius but he could not destroy the essentially dramatic character of a work which sets forth the

penciled dark eyebrows gave a striking and definite outline beneath lay a pair of large black eyes remarkable for tremulous expression of melancholy and timidity the cheek was white and bloodless as a snowberry though with the clear and perfect oval of good health the mouth was delicately formed with a certain sad quiet in its lines which indicated a habitually repressed and sensitive nature the dress of this young person as often happens in new england was in refinement and even elegance a marked contrast to that of her male companion and to the humble vehicle in which she rode there was not only the most fastidious neatness but a delicacy in the choice of colors an indication of elegant tastes in the whole arrangement and the quietest suggestion in the world of an acquaintance with the usages of fashion which struck one oddly in those wild and dreary surroundings on the whole she impressed one like those fragile wild flowers which in april cast their fluttering shadows from the mossy crevices of the old new england granite an existence in which colorless delicacy is united to a sort of elastic hardihood of life fit for the rocky soil and harsh winds it is born to encounter

raging and the sea was in all the commotion which such a general upturning creates the two travelers reached a point of elevated land where they paused a moment and the man drew up the jogging stiff jointed old farm horse and raised himself upon his feet to look out at the prospect there might be seen in the distance the blue kennebec sweeping out toward the ocean through its picturesque rocky shores docked with cedars and other dusky evergreens which were illuminated by the orange and flame colored trees of indian summer here and there scarlet creepers swung long trailing garlands over the faces of the dark rock and fringes of goldenrod above swayed with the brisk blowing wind that was driving the blue waters seaward in face of the up coming ocean tide a conflict which caused them to

and these are divided by a steep ledge of rocks where the spectators of this scene were sitting they could see in the distance a ship borne with tremendous force by the rising tide into the mouth of the river and encountering a northwest wind which had succeeded the gale as northwest winds often do on this coast the ship from what might be observed in the distance seemed struggling to make the wider channel but was constantly driven off by the baffling force of the wind there she is naomi said the old fisherman eagerly to his companion coming right in the young woman was one of the sort that never start and never exclaim but with all deeper emotions grow still the color slowly mounted into her cheek her lips parted and her eyes dilated with a wide bright expression her breathing came in thick gasps but she said nothing the old fisherman stood up in the wagon his coarse butternut colored coat flaps fluttering and snapping in the breeze while his interest seemed to be so intense in the efforts of the ship that he made involuntary and eager movements as if to direct her course a moment passed and his keen practiced eye discovered a change in her movements for he cried out involuntarily don t take the narrow channel to day and a moment after o lord o lord have mercy there they go look look look and in fact the ship rose on a great wave clear out of the water and the next second seemed to leap with a desperate plunge into the narrow passage for a moment there was a shivering of the masts and the rigging and she went down and was gone they re split to pieces cried the fisherman oh my poor girl my poor girl they re gone o lord have mercy the woman lifted up no voice but as one who has been shot through the heart falls with no cry she fell back a mist rose up over her great mournful eyes she had fainted the story of this wreck of a home bound ship just entering the harbor is yet told in many a family on this coast a few hours after the unfortunate crew

the season of the year the pleasant month of july which had now drawn near to its close the sun was already approaching the western limits of a wooded view when the actors in its opening scene must appear on a stage that is worthy of a more particular description the region was in one sense wild though it offered a picture that was not without some of the strongest and most pleasing features of civilization the country was what is termed rolling from some fancied resemblance to the surface of the ocean when it is just undulating with a long ground swell although wooded it was not as the american forest is wont to grow with tail straight trees towering toward the light but with intervals between the low oaks that were scattered profusely over the view and with much of that air of negligence that one is apt to see in grounds where art is made to assume the character of nature the trees with very few exceptions were what is called the burr oak a small variety of a very extensive genus and the spaces between them always irregular and often of singular beauty have obtained the name of openings the two terms combined giving their appellation to this particular species of native forest under the name of oak openings these woods so peculiar to certain districts of country are not altogether without some variety though possessing a general character of sameness the trees were of very uniform size being little taller than pear trees which they resemble a good deal in form and having trunks that rarely attain two feet in diameter the variety is produced by their distribution in places they stand with a regularity resembling that of an orchard then again they are more scattered and less formal while wide breadths of the land are occasionally seen in which they stand in copses with vacant spaces that bear no small affinity to artificial lawns being covered with verdure the grasses are supposed to be owing to the fires lighted periodically by the indians in order to clear their hunting grounds toward one of these grassy glades which was spread on an almost imperceptible acclivity and which might have contained some fifty or sixty acres of land the reader is now requested to turn his eyes far in the wilderness as was the spot four men were there and two of them had even some of the appliances of civilization about them the woods around were the then unpeopled forest of michigan and the small winding reach of placid water that was just visible in the distance was an elbow of the kalamazoo a beautiful little river that flows westward emptying its tribute into the vast expanse of lake michigan now this river has already become known by its villages and farms and railroads and mills but then not a dwelling of more pretension than the wigwam of the indian or an occasional shanty of some white adventurer had ever been seen on its banks in that day the whole of that fine peninsula with the exception of a narrow belt of country along the detroit river which was settled by the french as far back as near the close of the seventeenth century was literally a wilderness if a white man found his way into it it was as an indian trader a hunter or an

fortnight or three weeks and my intention is to hire a ship there which can easily be done by paying the insurance for the owner and to engage as many sailors as i think necessary among those who are accustomed to the whale fishing i do not intend to sail until the month of june and when shall i return ah dear sister how can i answer this question if i succeed many many months perhaps years will

gratitude for all your love and kindness your affectionate brother r walton letter archangel th march to mrs saville england how slowly the time passes here encompassed as i am by frost and snow yet a second step is taken towards my enterprise i have hired a vessel and am occupied in collecting my sailors those whom i have already engaged appear to be men on whom i can depend and are certainly possessed of dauntless courage but i have one want which i have never yet been able to satisfy and the absence of the object of which i now feel as a most severe evil i have no friend margaret when i am glowing with the enthusiasm of success there will be none to participate my joy if i am assailed by disappointment no one will endeavour to sustain me in dejection i shall commit my thoughts to paper it is true but that is a poor medium for the communication of feeling i desire the company of a man who could sympathize with me whose eyes would reply to mine you may deem me romantic my dear sister but i bitterly feel the want of a friend i have no one near me gentle yet courageous possessed of a cultivated as well as of a capacious mind whose tastes are like my own to approve or amend my plans how would such a friend repair the faults of your poor brother i am too ardent in execution and too impatient of difficulties but it is a still greater evil to me that i am self educated for the first fourteen years of my life i ran wild on a common and read nothing but our uncle thomas books of voyages at that age i became acquainted with the celebrated poets of our own country but it was only when it had ceased to be in my power to derive its most important benefits from such a conviction that i perceived the necessity of becoming acquainted with more languages than that of my native country now i am twenty eight and am in reality more illiterate than many schoolboys of fifteen it is true that i have thought more and that my daydreams are more extended and magnificent but they want as the painters call it keeping and i greatly need a friend who would have sense enough not to despise me as romantic and affection enough for me to endeavour to regulate my mind well these are useless complaints i shall certainly find no friend on the wide ocean nor even here in archangel among merchants and seamen yet some feelings unallied to the dross of human nature beat even in these rugged bosoms my lieutenant for instance is a man of wonderful courage and enterprise he is madly desirous of glory or rather to word my phrase more characteristically of advancement in his profession he is an englishman and in the midst of national and professional prejudices unsoftened by cultivation retains some of the noblest endowments of humanity i first became acquainted with him on board a whale vessel finding that he was unemployed in this city i easily engaged him to assist in my enterprise the master is a person of an excellent disposition and is remarkable in the ship for his gentleness and the mildness of his discipline this circumstance added to his well known integrity and dauntless courage made me very desirous to engage him a youth passed in solitude my best years spent under your gentle and feminine fosterage has so refined the groundwork of my character that i cannot overcome an intense distaste to the usual brutality exercised on board ship i have never believed it to be necessary and when i heard of a mariner equally noted for his kindliness of heart and the respect and obedience paid to him by his crew i felt myself peculiarly fortunate in being able to secure his services i heard of him first in rather a romantic manner from a lady who owes to him the happiness of her life this briefly is his story some years ago he loved a young russian lady of moderate fortune and having amassed a considerable sum in prize money the father of the girl consented to the match he saw his mistress once before the destined ceremony but she was bathed in tears and throwing herself at his feet entreated him to spare her confessing at the same time that she loved another but that he was poor and that her father would never consent to the union my generous friend reassured the suppliant and on being informed of the name of her lover instantly abandoned his pursuit he had already bought a farm with his money on which he had designed to pass the remainder of his life but he bestowed the whole on his rival together with the remains of his prize money to purchase stock and then himself solicited the young woman s father to consent to her marriage with her lover but the old man decidedly refused thinking himself bound in honour to my friend who when he found the father inexorable quitted his country nor returned until he heard that his former mistress was married according to her inclinations what a noble fellow you will exclaim he is so but then he is wholly uneducated he is as silent as a turk and a kind of ignorant careles

which his own nature has given against him in this matter of hunting and he gets into his early tub with acme glow of satisfaction and afterwards it is nice to find himself bright with mahogany tops buff tinted breeches and a pink coat the ordinary habiliments of an english gentleman are so sombre that his own eye is gratified and he feels that he has placed himself in the vanguard of society by thus shining in his apparel and he will ride this year he is fixed to that purpose he will ride straight and if possible he will like it but the ethiop cannot change his skin nor can any man add a cubit to his stature he doesn t like it and all around him in the field know how it is with him he himself knows how it is with others like himself and he congregates with his brethren the period of his penance has come upon him he has to pay the price of those pleasant interviews with his tradesmen he has to expiate the false boasts made to his female cousins that row of boots cannot be made to shine in his chamber for nothing the hounds have found and the fox is away men are fastening on their flat topped hats and feeling themselves in their stirrups horses are hot for the run and the moment for liking it has come if only it were possible but at moments such as these something has to be done the man who doesn t like it let him dislike it ever so much cannot check his horse and simply ride back to the hunting stables he understands that were he to do that he must throw up his cap at once and resign nor can he trot easily along the roads with the fat old country gentleman who is out on his rough cob and who looking up to the wind and remembering the position of adjacent coverts will give a good guess as to the direction in which the field will move no he must make an effort the time of his penance has come and the penance must be borne there is a spark of pluck about him though unfortunately he has brought it to bear in a wrong direction the blood still runs at his heart and he resolves that he will ride if only he could tell which way the stout gentleman on the cob has taken the road to the left with a few companions but our friend knows that the stout gentleman has a little game of his own which will not be suitable for one who intends to ride then the crowd in front has divided itself those to the right rush down a hill towards a brook with a ford one or two men whom he hates with an intensity of envy have jumped the brook and have settled to their work twenty or thirty others are hustling themselves through the water the time for a judicious start on that side is already gone but others a crowd of others are facing the big ploughed field immediately before them that is the straightest riding and with them he goes why has the scent lain so hot over the up turned heavy ground why do they go so fast at this the very first blush of the morning fortune is always against him and the horse is pulling him through the mud as though the brute meant to drag his arm out of the socket at the first fence as he is steadying himself a butcher passes him roughly in the jump and nearly takes away the side of his top boot he is knocked half out of his saddle and in that condition scrambles through when he has regained his equilibrium he sees the happy butcher going into the field beyond he means to curse the butcher when he catches him but the butcher is safe a field and a half before him he still sees the tail hounds and renews his effort he has meant to like it to day and he will so he rides at the next fence boldly where the butcher has left his mark and does it pretty well with a slight struggle why is it that he can never get over a ditch without some struggle in his saddle some scramble with his horse why does he curse the poor animal so constantly unless it be that he cannot catch the butcher now he rushes at a gate which others have opened for him but rushes too late and catches his leg mad with pain he nearly gives it up but the spark of pluck is still there and with throbbing knee he perseveres how he hates it it is all detestable now he cannot hold his horse because of his gloves and he cannot get them off the sympathetic beast knows that his master is unhappy and makes himself unhappy and troublesome in consequence our friend is still going riding wildly but still keeping a grain of caution for his fences he has not been down yet but has barely saved himself more than once the ploughs are very deep and his horse though still boring at him pants heavily oh that there might come a check or that the brute of a fox might happily go to ground but no the ruck of the hunt is far away from him in front and the game is running steadily straight for some well known though still distant protection but the man who doesn t like it still sees a red coat before him and perseveres in chasing the wearer of it the solitary red coat becomes distant and still more distant from him but he goes on while he can yet keep the line in which that red coat has ridden he must hurry himself however or he will be lost to humanity and will be alone he must hurry himself but his horse now desires to hurry no more so he puts his spurs to the brute savagely and then at some little fence some ignoble ditch they come down together in the mud and the question of any further effort is saved for the rider when he arises the red coat is out of sight and his own horse is half across the field before him in such a position is it possible that a man should like it about four o clock in the afternoon when the other men are coming in he turns up at the hunting stables and nobody asks him any questions he may have been doing fairly well for what anybody knows and as he says nothing of himself his d

that manual skill and activity is the first merit of all men and disparages such as say and do not overlooking the fact that some men namely poets are natural sayers sent into the world to the end of expression and confounds them with those whose province is action but who quit it to imitate the sayers but homer s words are as costly and admirable to homer as agamemnon s victories are to agamemnon the poet does not wait for the hero or the sage but as they act and think primarily so he writes primarily what will and must be spoken reckoning the others though primaries also yet in respect to him secondaries and servants as sitters or models in the studio of a painter or as assistants who bring building materials to an architect for poetry was all written before time was and whenever we are so finely organized that we can penetrate into that region where the air is music we hear those primal warblings and attempt to write them down but we lose ever and anon a word or a verse and substitute something of our own and thus miswrite the poem the men of more delicate ear write down these cadences more faithfully and these transcripts though imperfect become the songs of the nations for nature is as truly beautiful as it is good or as it is reasonable and must as much appear as it must be done or be known words and deeds are quite indifferent modes of the divine energy words are also actions and actions are a kind of words the sign and credentials of the poet are that he announces that which no man foretold he is the true and only doctor he knows and tells he is the only teller of news for he was present and privy to the appearance which he describes he is a beholder of ideas and an utterer of the necessary and causal for we do not speak now of men of poetical talents or of industry and skill in metre but of the true poet i took part in a conversation the other day concerning a recent writer of lyrics a man of subtle mind whose head appeared to be a music box of delicate tunes and rhythms and whose skill and command of language we could not sufficiently praise but when the question arose whether he was not only a lyrist but a poet we were obliged to confess that he is plainly a contemporary not an eternal man he does not stand out of our low limitations like a chimborazo under the line running up from the torrid base through all the climates of the globe with belts of the herbage of every latitude on its high and mottled sides but this genius is the landscape garden of a modern house adorned with fountains and statues with well bred men and women standing and sitting in the walks and terraces we hear through all the varied music the ground tone of conventional life our poets are men of talents who sing and not the children of music the argument is secondary the finish of the verses is primary for it is not metres but a metre making argument that makes a poem a thought so passionate and alive that like the spirit of a plant or an animal it has an architecture of its own and adorns nature with a new thing the thought and the form are equal in the order of time but in the order of genesis the thought is prior to the form the poet has a new thought he has a whole new experience to unfold he will tell us how it was with him and all men will be the richer in his fortune for the experience of each new age requires a new confession and the world seems always waiting for its poet i remember when i was young how much i was moved one morning by tidings that genius had appeared in a youth who sat near me at table he had left his work and gone rambling none knew whither and had written hundreds of lines but could not tell whether that which was in him was therein told he could tell nothing but that all was changed man beast heaven earth and sea how gladly we listened how credulous society seemed to be compromised we sat in the aurora of a sunrise which was to put out all the stars boston seemed to be at twice the distance it had the night before or was much farther than that rome what was rome plutarch and shakspeare were in the yellow leaf and homer no more should be heard of it is much to know that poetry has been written this very day under this very roof by your side what that wonderful spirit has not expired these stony moments are still sparkling and animated i had fancied that the oracles were all silent and nature had spent her fires and behold all night from every pore these fine auroras have been streaming every one has some interest in the advent of the poet and no one knows how much it may concern him we know that the secret of the world is profound but who or what shall be our interpreter we know not a mountain ramble a new style of face a new person may put the key into our hands of course the value of genius to us is in the veracity of its report talent may frolic and juggle genius realizes and adds mankind in good earnest have availed so far in understanding themselves and their work that the foremost watchman on the peak announces his news it is the truest word ever spoken and the phrase will be the fittest most musical and the unerring voice of the world for that time all that we call sacred history attests that the birth of a poet is the principal event in chronology man never so often deceived still watches for the arrival of a brother who can hold him steady to a truth until he has made it his own with what joy i begin to read a poem which i confide in as an inspiration and now my chains are to be broken i shall mount above these clouds and opaque airs in

not enter the world lest he learn to partake of its follies or perhaps of its vices in short preserve him as far as possible from all sin save that of which too great a portion belongs to all the fallen race of adam with the approach of his twenty first birthday comes the crisis of his fate if he survive it he will be happy and prosperous on earth and a chosen vessel among those elected for heaven but if it be otherwise the astrologer stopped and sighed deeply sir replied the parent still more alarmed than before your words are so kind your advice so serious that i will pay the deepest attention to your behests but can you not aid me farther in this most important concern believe me i will not be ungrateful i require and deserve no gratitude for doing a good action said the stranger in especial for contributing all that lies in my power to save from an abhorred fate the harmless infant to whom under a singular conjunction of planets last night gave life there is my address you

decisive period approaches that is before he has attained his twenty first year complete if you send him such as i desire i humbly trust that god will protect his own through whatever strong temptation his fate may subject him to he then gave his host his address which was a country seat near a post town in the south of england and bid him an affectionate farewell the mysterious stranger departed but his words remained impressed upon the mind of the anxious parent he lost his lady while his boy was still in infancy this calamity i think had been predicted by the astrologer and thus his confidence which like most people of the period he had freely given to the science was riveted and confirmed the utmost care therefore was taken to carry into effect the severe and almost ascetic plan of education which the sage had enjoined a tutor of the strictest principles was employed to superintend the youth s education he was surrounded by domestics of the most established character and closely watched and looked after by the anxious father himself the years of infancy childhood and boyhood passed as the father could have wished a young nazarene could not have been bred up with more rigour all that was evil was withheld from his observation he only heard what was pure in precept he only witnessed what was worthy in practice but when the boy began to be lost in the youth the attentive father saw cause for alarm shades of sadness which gradually assumed a darker character began to over cloud the young man s temper tears which seemed involuntary broken sleep moonlight wanderings and a melancholy for which he could assign no reason seemed to threaten at once his bodily health and the stability of his mind the astrologer was consulted by letter and returned for answer that this fitful state of mind was but the commencement of his trial and that the poor youth must undergo more and more desperate struggles with the evil that assailed him there was no hope of remedy save that he showed steadiness of mind in the study of the scriptures he suffers continued the letter of the sage from the awakening of those harpies the passions which have slept with him as with others till the period of life which he has now attained better far better that they torment him by ungrateful cravings than that he should have to repent having satiated them by criminal indulgence the dispositions of the young man were so excellent that he combated by reason and religion the fits of gloom which at times overcast his mind and it was not till he attained the commencement of his twenty first year that they assumed a character which made his father tremble for the consequences it seemed as if the gloomiest and most hideous of mental maladies was taking the form of religious despair still the youth was gentle courteous affectionate and submissive to his father s will and resisted with all his power the dark suggestions which were breathed into his mind as it seemed by some emanation of the evil principle exhorting him like the wicked wife of job to curse god and die the time at length arrived when he was to perform what was then thought a long and somewhat perilous journey to the mansion of the early friend who had calculated his nativity his road lay through several places of interest and he enjoyed the amusement of travelling more than he himself thought would have been possible thus he did not reach the place of his destination till noon on the day preceding his birthday it seemed as if he had been carried away with an unwonted tide of pleasurable sensation so as to forget in some degree what his father had communicated concerning the purpose of his journey he halted at length before a respectable but solitary old mansion to which he was directed as the abode of his father s friend the servants who came to take his horse told him he had been expected for two days he was led into a study where the stranger now a venerable

awful a menace the noxious plants the trees that by common consent are invested with a melancholy or baleful character so openly in his sight conspired against his peace from overhead and all about came so audible and startling whispers and the sighs of creatures so obviously not of earth that he could endure it no longer and with a great effort to break some malign spell that bound his faculties to silence and inaction he shouted with the full strength of his lungs his voice broken it seemed into an infinite multitude of unfamiliar sounds went babbling and stammering away into the distant reaches of the forest died into silence and all was as before but he had made a beginning at resistance and was encouraged he said i will not submit unheard there may be powers that are not

frayser was a poet only as he was a penitent in his dream taking from his clothing a small red leather pocketbook one half of which was leaved for memoranda he discovered that he was without a pencil he broke a twig from a bush dipped it into a pool of blood and wrote rapidly he had hardly touched the paper with the point of his twig when a low wild peal of laughter broke out at a measureless distance away and growing ever louder seemed approaching ever nearer a soulless heartless and unjoyous laugh like that of the loon solitary by the lakeside at midnight a laugh which culminated in an unearthly shout close at hand then died away by slow gradations as if the accursed being that uttered it had withdrawn over the verge of the world whence it had come but the man felt that this was not so that it was near by and had not moved a strange sensation began slowly to take possession of his body and his mind he could not have said which if any of his senses was affected he felt it rather as a consciousness a mysterious mental assurance of some overpowering presence some supernatural malevolence different in kind from the invisible existences that swarmed about him and superior to them in power he knew that it had uttered that hideous laugh and now it seemed to be approaching him from what direction he did not know dared not conjecture all his former fears were forgotten or merged in the gigantic terror that now held him in thrall apart from that he had but one thought to complete his written appeal to the benign powers who traversing the haunted wood might some time rescue him if he should be denied the blessing of annihilation he wrote with terrible rapidity the twig in his fingers rilling blood without renewal but in the middle of a sentence his hands denied their service to his will his arms fell to his sides the book to the earth and powerless to move or cry out he found himself staring into the sharply drawn face and blank dead eyes of his own mother standing white and silent in the garments of the grave ii in his youth halpin frayser had lived with his parents in nashville tennessee the fraysers were well to do having a good position in such society as had survived the wreck wrought by civil war their children had the social and educational opportunities of their time and place and had responded to good associations and instruction with agreeable manners and cultivated minds halpin being the youngest and not over robust was perhaps a trifle spoiled he had the double disadvantage of a mother s assiduity and a father s neglect frayser pere was what no southern man of means is not a politician his country or rather his section and state made demands upon his time and attention so exacting that to those of his family he was compelled to turn an ear partly deafened by the thunder of the political captains and the shouting his own included young halpin was of a dreamy indolent and rather romantic turn somewhat more addicted to literature than law the profession to which he was bred among those of his relations who professed the modern faith of heredity it was well understood that in him the character of the late myron bayne a maternal great grandfather had revisited the glimpses of the moon by which orb bayne had in his lifetime been sufficiently affected to be a poet of no small colonial distinction if not specially observed it was observable that while a frayser who was not the proud possessor of a sumptuous copy of the ancestral poetical works printed at the family expense and long ago withdrawn from an inhospitable market was a rare frayser indeed there was an illogical indisposition to honor the great deceased in the person of his spiritual successor halpin was pretty generally deprecated as an intellectual black sheep who was likely at any moment to disgrace the flock by bleating in meter the tennessee fraysers were a practical folk not practical in the popular sense of devotion to sordid pursuits but having a robust contempt for any qualities unfitting a man for the wholesome vocation of politics in justice to young halpin it should be said that while in him were pretty faithfully reproduced most of the mental and moral characteristics ascribed by history and family tradition to the famous colonial bard his succession to the gift and faculty divine was purely inferential not only had he never been known to court the muse but in truth he could not have written correctly a line of verse to save himself from the killer of the wise still there was no knowing when the dormant faculty might wake and

they say than young girls ought to shed at the threshold of the bridal chamber yet though her husband s head was getting gray and his heart had been chilled with an autumnal frost rose soon began to love him and wondered at her own conjugal affection he was all she had to love there were no children in a year or two poor mr toothaker was visited with a wearisome infirmity which settled in his joints and made him weaker than a child he crept forth about his business and came home at dinner time and eventide not with the manly tread that gladdens a wife s heart but slowly feebly jotting down each dull footstep with a melancholy dub of his staff we must pardon his pretty wife if she sometimes blushed to own him her visitors when they heard him coming looked for the appearance of some old old man but he dragged his nerveless limbs into the parlor and there was mr toothaker the disease increasing he never went into the sunshine save with a staff in his right hand and his left on his wife s shoulder bearing heavily downward like a dead man s hand thus a slender woman still looking maiden like she supported his tall broad chested frame along the pathway of their little garden and plucked the roses for her gray haired husband and spoke soothingly as to an infant his mind was palsied with his body its utmost energy was peevishness in a few months more she helped him up the staircase with a pause at every step and a longer one upon the landingplace and a heavy glance behind as he crossed the threshold of his chamber he knew poor man that the precincts of those four walls would thenceforth be his world his world his home his tomb at once a dwelling and a burial place till he were borne to a darker and a narrower one but rose was with him in the tomb he leaned upon her in his daily passage from the bed to the chair by the fireside and back again from the weary chair to the joyless bed his bed and hers their marriage bed till even this short journey ceased and his head lay all day upon the pillow and hers all night beside it how long poor mr toothaker was kept in misery death seemed to draw near the door and often to lift the latch and sometimes to thrust his ugly skull into the chamber nodding to rose and pointing at her husband but still delayed to enter this bedridden wretch cannot escape me quoth death i will go forth and run a race with the swift and

nor answered peevishly though his complaining accents roused her from her sweetest dream only to share his wretchedness he knew her faith yet nourished a cankered jealousy and when the slow disease had chilled all his heart save one lukewarm spot which death s frozen fingers were searching for his last words were what would my rose have done for her first love if she has been so true and kind to a sick old man like me and then his poor soul crept away and left the body lifeless though hardly more so than for years before and rose a widow though in truth it was the wedding night that widowed her she felt glad it must be owned when mr toothaker was buried because his corpse had retained such a likeness to the man half alive that she hearkened for the sad murmur of his voice bidding her shift his pillow but all through the next winter though the grave had held him many a month she fancied him calling from that cold bed rose rose come put a blanket on my feet so now the rosebud was the widow toothaker her troubles had come early and tedious as they seemed had passed before all her bloom was fled she was still fair enough to captivate a bachelor or with a widow s cheerful gravity she might have won a widower stealing into his heart in the very guise of his dead wife but the widow toothaker had no such projects by her watchings and continual cares her heart had become knit to her first husband with a constancy which changed its very nature and made her love him for his infirmities and infirmity for his sake when the palsied old man was gone even her early lover could not have supplied his place she had dwelt in a sick chamber and been the companion of a half dead wretch till she could scarcely breathe in a free air and felt ill at ease with the healthy and the happy she missed the fragrance of the doctor s stuff she walked the chamber with a noiseless footfall if visitors came in she spoke in soft and soothing accents and was startled and shocked by their loud voices often in the lonesome evening she looked timorously from the fireside to the bed with almost a hope of recognizing a ghastly face upon the pillow then went her thoughts sadly to her husband s grave if one impatient throb bad wronged him in his lifetime if she had secretly repined because her buoyant youth was imprisoned with his torpid age if ever while slumbering beside him a treacherous dream had admitted another into her heart yet the sick man had been preparing a revenge which the dead now claimed on his painful pillow he had cast a spell around her his groans and misery had proved

train his mind were within his reach no school no university no legal faculty had any part in training his powers when he became a lawyer and a politician the years most favourable to continuous study had already passed and the opportunities he found for reading were very scanty he knew but few authors in general literature though he knew those few thoroughly he taught himself a little mathematics but he could read no language save his own and can have had only the faintest acquaintance with european history or with any branch of philosophy the want of regular education was not made up for by the persons among whom his lot was cast till he was a grown man he never moved in any society from which he could learn those things with which the mind of an orator or a statesman ought to be stored even after he had gained some legal practice there was for many years no one for him to mix with except the petty practitioners of a petty town men nearly all of whom knew little more than he did himself schools gave him nothing and society gave him nothing but he had a powerful intellect and a resolute will isolation fostered not only self reliance but the habit of reflection and indeed of prolonged and intense reflection he made all that he knew a part of himself he thought everything out for himself his convictions were his own clear and coherent he was not positive or opinionated and he did not deny that at certain moments he pondered and hesitated long before he decided on his course but though he could keep a policy in suspense waiting for events to guide him he did not waver he paused and reconsidered but it was never his way either to go back upon a decision once made or to waste time in vain regrets that all he expected had not been attained he took advice readily and left many things to his ministers but he did not lean upon his advisers without vanity or ostentation he was always independent self contained prepared to take full responsibility for his acts that he was keenly observant of all that passed under his eyes that his mind played freely round everything it touched we know from the accounts of his talk which first made him famous in the town and neighbourhood where he lived his humour and his memory for anecdotes which he could bring out to good purpose at the right moment are qualities which europe deems distinctively american but no great man of action in the nineteenth century even in america possessed them in the same measure seldom has so acute a power of observation been found united to so abundant a power of sympathy these remarks may seem to belong to a study of his character rather than of his speeches yet they are not irrelevant because the interest of his speeches lies in their revelation of his character let us however return to the speeches and to the letters some of which given in this volume are scarcely less noteworthy than are the speeches what are the distinctive merits of these speeches and letters there is less humour in them than his reputation as a humorist would have led us to expect they are serious grave practical we feel that the man does not care to play over the surface of the subject or to use it as a way of displaying his cleverness he is trying to get right down to the very foundation of the matter and tell us what his real thoughts about it are in this respect he sometimes reminds us of bismarck s speeches which in their rude broken forth darting way always go straight to their destined aim always hit the nail on the head so too in their effort to grapple with fundamental facts lincoln s bear a sort of likeness to cromwell s speeches though cromwell has far less power of utterance and always seems to be wrestling with the difficulty of finding language to convey to others what is plain true and weighty to himself this difficulty makes the great protector though we can usually see what he is driving at frequently confused and obscure lincoln however is always clear simplicity directness and breadth are the notes of his thought aptness clearness and again simplicity are the notes of his diction the american speakers of his generation like most of those of the preceding generation but unlike those of that earlier generation to which alexander hamilton john adams marshall and madison belonged were generally infected by a floridity which made them a by word in europe even men of brilliant talent such as edward everett were by no means free from this straining after effect by highly coloured phrases and theatrical effects such faults have to day virtually vanished from the united states largely from a change in public taste to which perhaps the example set by lincoln himself may have contributed in the forties and fifties florid rhetoric was rampant especially in the west and south where taste was less polished than in the older states that lincoln escaped it is a striking mark of his independence as well as of his greatness there is no superfluous ornament in his orations nothing tawdry nothing otiose for the most part he addresses the reason of his hearers and credits them with desiring to have none but solid arguments laid before them when he does appeal to emotion he does it quietly perhaps even solemnly the note struck is always a high note the impressiveness of the appeal comes not from fervid vehemence of language but from the sincerity of his own convictions sometimes one can see that through its whole course the argument is suffused by the speaker s feeling and when the time comes for the feeling to be directly expressed it glows not with fitful flashes but with the steady heat of an intense and strenuous soul the impression which most of the speeches leave on the reader is that their matter has been carefully thought over even when the words have not been learn

station opposite any unoccupied part of the beach where the fish may be most conveniently cured and retains it till the end of the season formerly the master who arrived first on any station was

his warehouse let him assume that virtue if he have it not is not this the way in which we all live and the only way in which it is possible to live comfortably a gentleman gives a dinner party his lady who has to work all day like a dray horse and scold the servants besides to get things into order loses her temper we all pretty well know what that means well up to the moment when she has to show she is as bitter a piece of goods as may be but nevertheless she comes down all smiles although she knows that at that moment the drunken cook is spoiling the fish she assumes a virtue though she has it not and who will say she is not right well i say again and again to all young tradesmen advertise advertise advertise and don t stop to think too much about capital it is a bugbear capital is a bugbear and it is talked about by those who have it and by some that have not so much of it neither for the sake of putting down competition and keeping the market to themselves there s the same game going on all the world over and it s the natural game for mankind to play at they who s up a bit is all for keeping down them who is down and they who is down is so very soft through being down that they ve not spirit to force themselves up now i saw that very early in life there is always going on a battle between aristocracy and democracy aristocracy likes to keep itself to itself and democracy is just of the same opinion only wishes to become aristocracy first we of the people are not very fond of dukes but we d all like to be dukes well enough ourselves now there are dukes in trade as well as in society capitalists are our dukes and as they don t like to have their heels trod upon any more than the other ones why they are always preaching up capital it is their star and garter their coronet their ermine their robe of state their cap of maintenance their wand of office their noli me tangere but stars and garters caps and wands and all other noli me tangeres are gammon to those who can see through them and capital is gammon capital is a very nice thing if you can get it it is the desirable result of trade a tradesman looks to end with a capital but it s gammon to say that he can t begin without it you might as well say a man can t marry unless he has first got a family why he marries that he may have a family it s putting the cart before the horse it s my opinion that any man can be a duke if so be it s born to him it requires neither wit nor industry nor any pushing nor go ahead whatsoever a man may sit still in his arm chair half asleep half his time and only half awake the other and be as good a duke as need be well it s just the same in trade if a man is born to a dukedom there if he begins with a large capital why i for one would not thank him to be successful any fool could do as much as that he has only to keep on polishing his own star and garter and there are lots of people to swear that there is no one like him but give me the man who can be a duke without being born to it give me the man who can go ahead in trade without capital who can begin the world with a quick pair of hands a quick brain to govern them and can end with a capital well there you are a young tradesman beginning the world without capital capital though it s a bugbear nevertheless it s a virtue therefore as you haven t got it you must assume it that s credit credit i take to be the belief of other people in a thing that doesn t really exist when you go into your friend smith s house and find mrs s all smiles you give her credit for the sweetest of tempers your friend s knows better but then you see she s had wit enough to obtain credit when i draw a bill at three months and get it done i do the same thing that s credit give me credit enough and i don t care a brass button for capital if i could have but one wish i would never ask a fairy for a second or a third let me have but unreserved credit and i ll be

suggestion both set themselves about making the preparations necessary for their usual frugal but hearty meal we will profit by this pause in the discourse to give the reader some idea of the appearance of the men each of whom is destined to enact no insignificant part in our legend it would not have been easy to find a more noble specimen of vigorous manhood than was offered in the person of him who called himself hurry harry his real name was henry march but the frontiersmen having caught the practice of giving sobriquets from the indians the appellation of hurry was far oftener applied to him than his proper designation and not unfrequently he was termed hurry skurry a nickname he had obtained from a dashing reckless offhand manner and a physical restlessness that kept him so constantly on the move as to cause him to be known along the whole line of scattered habitations that lay between the province and the canadas the stature of hurry harry exceeded six feet four and being unusually well proportioned his strength fully realized the idea created by his gigantic frame the face did no discredit to the rest of the man for it was both good humored and handsome his air was free and though his manner necessarily partook of the rudeness of a border life the grandeur that pervaded so noble a physique prevented it from becoming altogether vulgar deerslayer as hurry called his companion was a very different person in appearance as well as in character in stature he stood about six feet in his moccasins but his frame was comparatively light and slender showing muscles however that promised unusual agility if not unusual strength his face would have had little to recommend it except youth were it not for an expression that seldom failed to win upon those who had leisure to examine it and to yield to the feeling of confidence it created this expression was simply that of guileless truth sustained by an earnestness of purpose and a sincerity of feeling that rendered it remarkable at times this air of integrity seemed to be so simple as to awaken the suspicion of a want of the usual means to discriminate between artifice and truth but few came in serious contact with the man without losing this distrust in respect for his opinions and motives both these frontiersmen were still young hurry having reached the age of six or eight and twenty while deerslayer was several years his junior their attire needs no particular description though it may be well to add that it was composed in no small degree of dressed deer skins and had the usual signs of belonging to those who pass their time between the skirts of civilized society and the boundless forests there was notwithstanding some attention to smartness and the picturesque in the arrangements of deerslayer s dress more particularly in the part connected with his arms and accoutrements his rifle was in perfect condition the handle of his hunting knife was neatly carved his powder horn was ornamented with suitable devices lightly cut into the material and his shot pouch was decorated with wampum on the other hand hurry harry either from constitutional recklessness or from a secret consciousness how little his appearance required artificial aids wore everything in a careless slovenly manner as if he felt a noble scorn for the trifling accessories of dress and ornaments perhaps the peculiar effect of his fine form and great stature was increased rather than lessened by this unstudied and disdainful air of indifference come deerslayer fall to and prove that you have a delaware stomach as you say you have had a delaware edication cried hurry setting the example by opening his mouth to receive a slice of cold venison steak that would have made an entire meal for a european peasant fall to lad and prove your manhood on this poor devil of a doe with your teeth as you ve already done with your rifle nay nay hurry there s little manhood in killing a doe and that too out of season though there might be some in bringing down a painter or a catamount returned the other disposing himself to comply the delawares have given me my name not so much on account of a bold heart as on account of a quick eye and an actyve foot there may not be any cowardyce in overcoming a deer but sartain it is there s no great valor the delawares themselves are no

another huge triangular piles of planks are also reared in different parts of the devoted messuage and a little group of trees that still grace the eastern end which rises in a gentle ascent have just received warning to quit expressed by a daub of white paint and are to give place to a curious grove of chimneys it would perhaps hurt others in my situation to reflect that this little range of pasturage once belonged to my father whose family was of some consideration in the world and was sold by patches to remedy distresses in which he involved himself in an attempt by commercial adventure to redeem his diminished fortune while the building scheme was in full operation this circumstance was often pointed out to me by the class of friends who are anxious that no part of your misfortunes should escape your observation such pasture ground lying at the very town s end in turnips and potatoes the parks would bring l per acre and if leased for building oh it was a gold mine and all sold for an old song out of the ancient possessor s hands my comforters cannot bring me to repine much on this subject if i could be allowed to look back on the past without interruption i could willingly give up the enjoyment of present income and the hope of future profit to those who have purchased what my father sold i regret the alteration of the ground only because it destroys associations and i

devastation will not be consummated in my day although the adventurous spirit of times short while since passed gave rise to the undertaking i have been encouraged to think that the subsequent changes have so far damped the spirit of speculation that the rest of the woodland footpath leading to aunt margaret s retreat will be left undisturbed for her time and mine i am interested in this for every step of the way after i have passed through the green already mentioned has for me something of early remembrance there is the stile at which i can recollect a cross child s maid upbraiding me with my infirmity as she lifted me coarsely and carelessly over the flinty steps which my brothers traversed with shout and bound i remember the suppressed bitterness of the moment and conscious of my own inferiority the feeling of envy with which i regarded the easy movements and elastic steps of my more happily formed brethren alas these goodly barks have all perished on life s wide ocean and only that which seemed so little seaworthy as the naval phrase goes has reached the port when the tempest is over then there is the pool where manoeuvring our little navy constructed out of the broad water

that he was to die in an indian jungle in quest of rupees there is so much more of remembrance about the little walk that as i stop rest on my crutch headed cane and look round with that species of comparison between the thing i was and that which i now am it almost induces me to doubt my own identity until i find myself in face of the honeysuckle porch of aunt margaret s dwelling with its irregularity of front and its odd projecting latticed windows where the workmen seem to have made it a study that no one of them should resemble another in form size or in the old fashioned stone entablature and labels which adorn them this tenement once the manor house of the earl s closes we still retain a slight hold upon for in some family arrangements it had been settled upon aunt

means of acquitting myself both of my duty and obligation to my departed friend what kinder office lies in me to do to these his most valuable and imperishable remains than to commit them to the

affectation and officiousness in thanking you more than comes to my share for doing a thing which is in truth of a public consideration as it is doing an honour to your country for so unquestionably it is to do honour to him who was an honour to it i have but one thing to say either to obviate or to answer such an objection if it shall be made to me which is that i loved mr dryden i have not touched upon any other public honour or bounty done by you to your country i have industriously declined entering upon a theme of so extensive a nature and of all your numerous and continual largesses to the public i have only singled out this as what most particularly affected me i confess freely to your grace i very much admire all those other donations but i much more love this and i cannot help it if i am naturally more delighted with any thing that is amiable than with any thing that is wonderful whoever shall censure me i dare be confident you my lord will excuse me for any thing that i shall say with due regard to a gentleman for whose person i had as just an affection as i have an admiration of his writings and indeed mr dryden had personal qualities to challenge both love and esteem from all who were truly acquainted with him he was of a nature exceedingly humane and compassionate easily forgiving injuries and capable of a prompt and sincere reconciliation with them who had offended him such a temperament is the only solid foundation of all moral virtues and sociable endowments his friendship where he professed it went much beyond his professions and i have been told of strong and generous instances of it by the persons themselves who received them though his hereditary income was little more than a bare competency as his reading had been very extensive so was he very happy in a memory tenacious of every thing that he had read he was not more possessed of knowledge than he was communicative of it but then his communication of it was by no means pedantic or imposed upon the conversation but just such and went so far as by the natural turns of the discourse in which he was engaged it was necessarily promoted or required he was extreme ready and gentle in his correction of the errors of any writer who thought fit to consult him and full as ready and patient to admit of the reprehension of others in respect of his own oversight or mistakes he was of very easy i may say of very pleasing access but something slow and as it were diffident in his advances to others he had something in his nature that abhorred intrusion into any society whatsoever indeed it is to be regretted that he was rather blameable in the other extreme for by that means he was personally less known and consequently his character might become liable both to misapprehensions and misrepresentations to the best of my knowledge and observation he was of all the men that ever i knew one of the most modest and the most easily to be discountenanced in his approaches either to his superiors or his equals i have given your grace this slight sketch of his personal character as well to vindicate his memory as to justify myself for the love which i bore to his person and i have the rather done it because i hope it may be acceptable to you to know that he was worthy of the distinction you have shewn him as a man as well as an author as to his writings i shall not take upon me to speak of them for to say little of them would not be to do them right and to say all that i ought to say would be to be very voluminous but i may venture to say in general terms that no man hath written in our language so much and so various matter and in so various manners so well another thing i may say very peculiar to him which is that his parts did not decline with his years but that he was an improving writer to his last even to near seventy years of age improving even in fire and imagination as well as in judgment witness his ode on st cecilia s day and his fables his latest performances he was equally excellent in verse and in prose his prose had all the clearness imaginable together with all the nobleness of expression all the graces and ornaments

point of view paid highly desirable tithes but it was nestled in a snug well wooded hollow quite an hour s journey on horseback from any turnpike where it was never reached by the vibrations of the coach horn or of public opinion it was an important looking village with a fine old church and large churchyard in the heart of it and two or three large brick and stone homesteads with well walled orchards and ornamental weathercocks standing close upon the road and lifting more imposing fronts than the rectory which peeped from among the trees on the other side of the churchyard a village which showed at once the summits of its social life and told the practised eye that there was no great park and manor house in the vicinity but that there were several chiefs in raveloe who could farm badly quite at their ease drawing enough money from their bad farming in those war times to live in a rollicking fashion and keep a jolly christmas whitsun and easter tide it was fifteen years since silas marner had first come to raveloe he was then simply a pallid young man with prominent short sighted brown eyes whose appearance would have had nothing strange for people of average culture and experience but for the villagers near whom he had come to settle it had mysterious peculiarities which corresponded with the exceptional nature of his occupation and his advent from an unknown region called north ard so had his way of life he invited no comer to step across his door sill and he never strolled into the village to drink a pint at the rainbow or to gossip at the wheelwright s he sought no man or woman save for the purposes of his calling or in order to supply himself with necessaries and it was soon clear to the raveloe lasses that he would never urge one of them to accept him against her will quite as if he had heard them declare that they would never marry a dead man come to life again this view of marner s personality was not without another ground than his pale face and unexampled eyes for jem rodney the mole catcher averred that one evening as he was returning homeward he saw silas marner leaning against a stile with a heavy bag on his back instead of resting the bag on the stile as a man in his senses would have done and that on coming up to him he saw that marner s eyes were set like a dead man s and he spoke to him and shook him and his limbs were stiff and his hands clutched the bag as if they d been made of iron but just as he had made up his mind that the weaver was dead he came all right again like as you might say in the winking of an eye and said good night and walked off all this jem swore he had seen more by token that it was the very day he had been mole catching on squire cass s land down by the old saw pit some said marner must have been in a fit a word which seemed to explain things otherwise incredible but the argumentative mr macey clerk of the parish shook his head and asked if anybody was ever known to go off in a fit and not fall down a fit was a stroke wasn t it and it was in the nature of a stroke to partly take away the use of a man s limbs and throw him on the parish if he d got no children to look to no no it was no stroke that would let a man stand on his legs like a horse between the shafts and then walk off as soon as you can say gee but there might be such a thing as a man s soul being loose from his body and going out and in like a bird out of its nest and back and that was how folks got over wise for they went to school in this shell less state to those who could teach them more than their neighbours could learn with their five senses and the parson and where did master marner get his knowledge of herbs from and charms too if he liked to give them away jem rodney s story was no more than what might have been expected by anybody who had seen how marner had cured sally oates and made her sleep like a baby when her heart had been beating enough to burst her body for two months and more while she had been under the doctor s care he might cure more folks if he would but he was worth speaking fair if it was only to keep him from doing you a mischief it was partly to this vague fear that marner was indebted for protecting him from the persecution that his singularities might have drawn upon him but still more to the fact that the old linen weaver in the neighbouring parish of tarley being dead his handicraft made him a highly welcome settler to the richer housewives of the district and even to the more provident cottagers who had their little stock of yarn at the year s end their sense of his usefulness would have counteracted any repugnance or suspicion which was not confirmed by a deficiency in the quality or the tale of the cloth he wove for them and the years had rolled on without producing any change in the impressions of the neighbours concerning marner except the change from novelty to habit at the end of fifteen years the raveloe men said just the same things about silas marner as at the beginning they did not say them quite so often but they believed them much more strongly when they did say them there was only one important addition which the years had brought it was that master marner had laid by a fine sight of money somewhere and that he could buy up bigger men than himself but while opinion concerning him had remained nearly stationary and his daily habits had presented scarcely any visible change marner s inward life had been a history and a metamorphosis as that of every fervid nature must be when it has fled or been condemned to solitude his life before he came to raveloe had been filled with the movement the mental activity and the close fellowship which in that day as in this marked the life of an artisan early incorporated in a narrow

bowing to the ground but you don t know the way home said she and i am dreadfully hungry having ascertained from her that she was the king s daughter and lived at the palace the prince reflected for a moment and then entering the shop dragged forth the maker of sugared cream beans and ordered him to lead the way to the presence of the king the confectioner crouching to the earth immediately started off and the prince and princess side by side followed over what seemed to them a very short road to the palace the princess talked a great deal but the prince was rather quiet he had a good many things to think about he was the younger son of a king who lived far away to the north and had been obliged to flee the kingdom on account of the custom of allowing only one full grown heir to the throne to live in the country now thought he this is an excellent commencement of my adventures here is a truly lovely princess whom i am conducting to her anxious parent he will be overwhelmed with gratitude and will doubtless bestow upon me the government of a province or perhaps he will make me his vizier no i will not accept that the province will suit me better having settled this little matter to his mind he gladdened the heart of the princess with the dulcet tones of his gentle voice on reaching the palace they went directly to the grand hall where the king was giving audience justly astounded at perceiving his daughter now veiled approaching under the guidance of a crouching sugar bean maker and a strange young man he sat in silent amazement until the prince who was used to court life had made his manners and related his story when the king had heard it he clapped his hands three times and in rushed twenty four eunuchs take said the monarch this bird to her bower and they surrounded the princess and hurried her off to the women s apartments then he clapped his hands twice and in rushed twenty four armed guards from another door bind me this dog quoth the king pointing to the prince and they bound him in a twinkling is this the way you treat a stranger cried the prince aye said the king merrily we will treat you royally you are tired to night and to morrow you shall be lodged and feasted daintily and the day after we will have a celebration when you shall be beaten with sticks and shall fight a tiger and be tossed by a bull and be bowstrung and beheaded and drawn and quartered and we will have a nice time bear him away to his soft couch illustration the guards then led the prince away to be kept a prisoner until the day for the celebration the room to which he was conducted was comfortable and he soon had a plenteous supper laid out before him of which he partook with great avidity having finished his meal he sat down to reflect upon his condition but feeling very sleepy and remembering that he would have a whole day of leisure to morrow for such reflections he concluded to go to bed before doing so however he wished to make all secure for the night examining the door he found there was no lock to it and being unwilling to remain all night liable to intrusion he pondered the matter for some minutes and then took up a wide and very heavy stool and having partially opened the door he put the stool up over it resting it partly on the door and partly on the surrounding woodwork so that if any one tried to come in and pushed the door open the stool would fall down and knock the intruder s head off having arranged this to his satisfaction the prince went to bed that evening the princess aufalia was in great grief for she had heard of the sentence pronounced upon the prince and felt herself the cause of it what other reason she had to grieve over the prince s death need not be told her handmaidens fully sympathized with her and one of them nerralina the handsomest and most energetic of them all soon found by proper inquiry that the prince was confined in the fourth story of the tower of tears so they devised a scheme for his rescue each one of the young ladies contributed her scarf and when they were all tied together the conclave decided that they made a rope plenty long enough to reach from the prince s window to the ground thus much settled it only remained to get this means of escape to the prisoner this the lady nerralina volunteered to do waiting until the dead of night she took off her slippers and with the scarf rope rolled up into a ball under her arm she silently stepped past the drowsy sentinels and reaching the prince s room pushed open the door and the stool fell down and knocked her head off her body lay in the doorway but her head rolled into the middle of the room notwithstanding the noise occasioned by this accident the prince did not awake but in the morning when he was up and nearly dressed he was astonished at seeing a lady s head in the middle of the room illustration hallo said he here s somebody s head picking it up he regarded it with considerable interest then seeing the body in the doorway he put the head and it together and finding they fitted came to the conclusion that they belonged to each other and that the stool had done the mischief when he saw the bundle of scarfs lying by the body he unrolled it and soon imagined the cause of the lady s visit poor thing he said doubtless the princess sent her here with this and most likely with a message also which now i shall never hear but these poor women what do they know this rope will not bear a man like me well well this poor girl is dead i will pay respect to her and so he picked her up and put her

once where we are i suppose it will cost something to have them come over said mrs holiday she was not so anxious to have the children come as to desire that the question should be decided without having all the objections fully considered besides she was afraid that if the question were to be decided hastily without proper regard to the difficulties that were in the way there would be danger that it would be reconsidered after more mature reflection and the decision reversed so she wished that every thing that could be brought against the project should be fully taken into the account at the outset i suppose said she that their expenses in coming out and in returning and in remaining here with us in the interim would amount to a considerable sum yes said mr holiday but that is of no consequence i don t know what we should do about having them taken care of on the passage added mrs holiday o there would be no difficulty about that said mr holiday george could easily find some passenger coming out in the ship who would look after them while at sea i have no doubt and if he should not find any one it would be of no consequence rollo could take care of himself and of jane too asked mrs holiday yes replied mr holiday and of jane too that is with the help of the chambermaids they have excellent chambermaids on board the atlantic steamers so it was concluded to send for rollo and jane to embark on board the steamer at new york and sail for europe mr holiday wrote to rollo s uncle george requesting him to make the necessary arrangements for the voyage and then to take the children to new york and put them on board he was to commit them if possible to the charge of some one of the passengers on board the ship if for any reason he should not succeed in finding any passenger to take care of them he was to state the case to the captain of the ship that he might see to them a little from time to time and in addition to this he was to put them under the special charge of one of the chambermaids promising her that she should be well rewarded for her services on the arrival of the ship in liverpool the important tidings of the determination which had been made that rollo and jane should actually cross the atlantic were first announced to the children one evening near the end of may they were eating their supper at the time seated on a stone seat at the bottom of the garden where there was a brook their supper as it consisted of a bowl of bread and milk for each was very portable and they had accordingly gone down to their stone seat to eat it as they often did on pleasant summer evenings the stone seat was in such a position that the setting sun shone very cheerily upon it on this occasion rollo had finished his milk and was just going down to the brook by a little path which led that way in order to see if there were any fishes in the water while jane was giving the last spoonful of her milk to their kitten on the stone near where jane was sitting was a small birdcage this cage was one which jane used to put her kitten in the kitten was of a mottled color which gave

proper but an association of states in the nature of contract merely can it as a contract be peaceably unmade by less than all the parties who made it one party to a contract may violate it break it so to speak but does it not require all to lawfully rescind it descending from these general principles we find the proposition that in legal contemplation the union is perpetual confirmed by the history of the union itself the union is much older than the constitution it was formed in fact by the articles of association in it was matured and continued by the declaration of independence in it was further matured and the faith of all the then thirteen states expressly plighted and engaged that it should be perpetual by the articles of confederation in and finally in one of the declared objects for ordaining and establishing the constitution was to form a more perfect union but if the destruction of the union by one or by a part only of the states be lawfully possible the union is less perfect than before the constitution having lost the vital element of perpetuity it follows from these views that no state upon its own mere motion can lawfully get out of the union that resolves and ordinances to that effect are legally void and that acts of violence within any state or states against the authority of the united states are insurrectionary or revolutionary according to circumstances i therefore consider that in view of the constitution and the laws the union is unbroken and to the extent of my ability i shall take care as the constitution itself expressly enjoins upon me that the laws of the union be faithfully executed in all the states doing this i deem to be only a simple duty on my part and i shall perform it so far as practicable unless my rightful masters the american people shall withhold the requisite means or in some authoritative manner direct the contrary i trust this will not be regarded as a menace but only as the declared purpose of the union that it will constitutionally defend and maintain itself in doing this there needs to be no bloodshed or violence and there shall be none unless it be forced upon the national authority the power confided to me will be used to hold occupy and possess the property and places belonging to the government and to collect the duties and imposts but beyond what may be necessary for these objects there will be no invasion no using of force against or among the people anywhere where hostility to the united states in any interior locality shall be so great and universal as to prevent competent resident citizens from holding the federal offices there will be no attempt to force obnoxious strangers among the people for that object while the strict legal right may exist in the government to enforce the exercise of these offices the attempt to do so would be so irritating and so nearly impracticable withal that i deem it better to forego for the time the uses of such offices the mails unless repelled will continue to be furnished in all parts of the union so far as possible the people everywhere shall have that sense of perfect security which is most favorable to calm thought and reflection the course here indicated will be followed unless current events and experience shall show a modification or change to be proper and in every case and exigency my best discretion will be exercised according to circumstances actually existing and with a view and a hope of a peaceful solution of the national troubles and the restoration of fraternal sympathies and affections that there are persons in one section or another who seek to destroy the union at all events and are glad of any pretext to do it i will neither affirm nor deny but if there be such i need address no word to them to those however who really love the union may i not speak before entering upon so grave a matter as the destruction of our national fabric with all its benefits its memories and its hopes would it not be wise to ascertain precisely why we do it will you hazard so desperate a step while there is any possibility that any portion of the ills you fly from have no real existence will you while the certain ills you fly to are greater than all the real ones you fly from will you risk the commission of so fearful a mistake all profess to be content in the union if all constitutional rights can be maintained is it true then that any right plainly written in the constitution has been denied i think not happily the human mind is so constituted that no party can reach to the audacity of doing this think if you can of a single instance in which a plainly written provision of the constitution has ever been denied if by the mere force of numbers a majority should deprive a minority of any clearly written constitutional right it might in a moral point of view justify revolution certainly would if such a right were a vital one but such is not our case all the vital rights of minorities and of individuals are so plainly assured to them by affirmations and negations guaranties and prohibitions in the constitution that controversies never arise concerning them but no organic law can ever be framed with a provision specifically applicable to every question which may occur in practical administration no foresight can anticipate nor any document of reasonable length contain express provisions for all possible questions shall fugitives from labor be surrendered by national or state authority the constitution does not expressly say may congress prohibit slavery in the territories the constitution does not expressly say must congress protect slavery in the territories the constitution does not expressly say from questions of this class sprin

interesting communications from dr aloys sprenger the well known orientalist and arabist concerning the routes of the great caravans my friend supports his suspicions that an error of direction has been made and geographers will enjoy the benefit of his conscientious studies topographical and linguistic the truculent attacks made upon pilgrims and darwayshes call for a few words of notice even that learned and amiable philanthropist the late dr john wilson of bombay lands of the bible vol ii p alludes in the case of the spaniard badia alias ali bey al abbasi to the unjustifiable fanciful disguise of a mohammedan pilgrim the author of the ruddy goose theory voice of israel from mount sinai and compiler of the historical geography of arabia has dealt a foul blow to the memory of burckhardt the energetic and inoffensive swiss traveller whose name has ever been held in the highest repute and now the government chaplain indites introduction p xxvii the following invidious remarks touching the travels of ludovico di varthema the vir deo carus be it remarked of the learned and laical julius caesar scaliger this is not the place to discuss the morality of an act involving the deliberate and voluntary denial of what a man holds to be truth in a matter so sacred as that of religion such a violation of conscience is not justifiable by the end which the renegade may have in view however abstractedly praiseworthy it may be and even granting that his demerit should be gauged by the amount of knowledge which he possesses of what is true and what false the conclusion is inevitable that nothing short of utter ignorance of the precepts of his faith or a p xxi conscientious disbelief in them can fairly relieve the christian who conforms to islamism without a corresponding persuasion of its verity of the deserved odium all honest men attach to apostasy and hypocrisy the reply to this tirade is simply judge not especially when you are ignorant of the case which you are judging perhaps also the writer may ask himself is it right for those to cast stones who dwell in a tenement not devoid of fragility the second attack proceeds from a place whence no man would reasonably have expected it the author of the narrative of a year s journey through central and eastern arabia vol i pp thus expresses his opinions passing oneself off for a wandering darweesh as some european explorers have attempted to do in the east is for more reasons than one a very bad plan it is unnecessary to dilate on that moral aspect of the proceeding which will always first strike unsophisticated minds to feign a religion which the adventurer himself does not believe to perform with scrupulous exactitude as of the highest and holiest import practices which he inwardly ridicules and which he intends on his return to hold up to the ridicule of others to turn for weeks and months together the most sacred and awful bearings of man towards his creator into a deliberate and truthless mummery not to mention other and yet darker touches all this seems hardly compatible with the character of a european gentleman let alone that of a christian this comes admirably a propos from a traveller who born a protestant of jewish descent placed himself in connection with in plain words took the vows of the order of the jesuits an order well known in the annals of philanthropic daring a popular preacher who declaimed openly at bayrut and elsewhere against his own nation till the proceedings of a certain father michael p xxii cohen were made the subject of an official report by mr consul general moore bayrut november an englishman by birth who accepted french protection a secret mission and the liberality of the present emperor of the french a military officer travelling in the garb of what he calls a native syrian quack with a comrade who by a slight but necessary fiction passed for his brother in law fn a gentleman who by return to protestantism violated his vows and a traveller who was proved by the experiment of colonel now sir lewis pelly to have brought upon himself all the perils and adventures that have caused his charming work to be considered so little worthy of trust truly such attack argues a sublime daring it is the principle of vieille coquette nouvelle devote it is satan preaching against sin both writers certainly lack the

too brilliant his thoughts too subtle he loved to idealize reality and this is a taste shared by few we are willing to have our passing whims exalted into passions for this gratifies our vanity but few of us understand or sympathize with the endeavour to ally the love of abstract beauty and adoration of abstract good the to agathon kai to kalon of the socratic philosophers with our sympathies with our kind in this shelley resembled plato both taking more delight in the abstract and the ideal than in the special and tangible this did not result from imitation for it was not till shelley resided in italy that he made plato his study he then translated his symposium and his ion and the english language boasts of no more brilliant composition than plato s praise of love translated by shelley to return to his own poetry the luxury of imagination which sought nothing beyond itself as a child burdens itself with spring flowers thinking of no use beyond the enjoyment of gathering them often showed itself in his verses they will be only appreciated by minds which have resemblance to his own and the mystic subtlety of many of his thoughts will share the same fate the metaphysical strain that characterizes much of what he has written was indeed the portion of his works to which apart from those whose scope was to awaken mankind to aspirations for what he considered the true and good he was himself particularly attached there is much however that speaks to the many when he would consent to dismiss these huntings after the obscure which entwined with his nature as they were he did with difficulty no poet ever expressed in sweeter more heart reaching or more passionate verse the gentler or more forcible emotions of the soul a wise friend once wrote to shelley you are still very young and in certain essential respects you do not yet sufficiently perceive that you are so it is seldom that the young know what youth is till they have got beyond its period and time was not given him to attain this knowledge it must be remembered that there is the stamp of such inexperience on all he wrote he had not completed his nine and twentieth year when he died the calm of middle life did not add the seal of the virtues which adorn maturity to those generated by the vehement spirit of youth through life also he was a martyr to ill health and constant pain wound up his nerves to a pitch of susceptibility that rendered his views of life different from those of a man in the enjoyment of healthy sensations perfectly gentle and forbearing in manner he suffered a good deal of internal irritability or rather excitement and his fortitude to bear was almost always on the stretch and thus during a short life he had gone through more experience of sensation than many whose existence is protracted if i die to morrow he said on the eve of his unanticipated death i have lived to be older than my father the weight of thought and feeling burdened him heavily you read his sufferings in his attenuated frame while you perceived the mastery he held over them in his animated countenance and brilliant eyes he died and the world showed no outward sign but his influence over mankind though slow in growth is fast augmenting and in the ameliorations that have taken place in the political state of his country we may trace in part the operation of his arduous struggles his spirit gathers peace in its new state from the sense that though late his exertions were not made in vain and in the progress of the liberty he so fondly loved he died and his place among those who knew him intimately has never been filled up he walked beside them like a spirit of good to comfort and benefit to enlighten the darkness of life with irradiations of genius to cheer it with his sympathy and love any one once attached to shelley must feel all other affections however true and fond as wasted on barren soil in comparison it is our best consolation to know that such a pure minded and exalted being was once among us and now exists where we hope one day to join him although the intolerant in their blindness poured down anathemas the spirit of good who can judge the heart never rejected him in the notes appended to the poems i have endeavoured to narrate the origin and history of each the loss of nearly all letters and papers which refer to his early life renders the execution more imperfect than it would otherwise have been i have however the liveliest recollection of all that was done and said during the period of my knowing him every impression is as clear as if stamped yesterday and i have no apprehension of any mistake in my statements as far as they go in other respects i am indeed incompetent but i feel the importance of the task and regard it as my most sacred duty i endeavour to fulfil it in a manner he would himself approve and hope in this publication to lay the first stone of a monument due to shelley s genius his sufferings and his virtues

leading across the river from side to side the town is filled with magnificent churches and palaces built some of them a thousand years ago and all so richly adorned with sculptures paintings bronzes and mosaics that the whole world flock there to see them people go there chiefly in the winter at that season the town is crowded with strangers a great many people too go there in the winter to avoid the cold weather which prevails at that time of the year in all the more northerly countries of europe there is so little winter in florence that few of the houses have any fireplaces in them except in the kitchen when there comes a cold day the people warm themselves by means of a jug or jar of earthen ware with a handle passing over across the top by which they carry it about they fill these jars half full of hot embers and so carry them with them wherever they want to go the women when they sit down put the jar under their dresses on the floor or pavement beneath them and the men place it right before them between their feet you will see market women and flower girls sitting in the corners of the streets in the winter attending to their business and keeping themselves warm all the time with these little fire jars and artists in the palaces and picture galleries each with one of them by his side or close before him while he is at work copying the works of the great masters or making drawings from the antique statues there is another very curious use that the people of florence make of these jars and that is they warm the beds with them when any body is sick so as to require this indulgence you would think it very difficult to warm a bed with an open jar filled with burning embers the way they do it is this they hang the jar in the inside of a sort of wooden cage shaped like a bushel basket and about as large they turn this cage upside down and hang the jar up in it by means of a hook depending inside they turn down the bed clothes and put the cage in it jar of coals and all they then put back the bed clothes and cover the cage all up they leave it so for a quarter of an hour and then carefully turning the clothes down again they take the jar out and the bed is warmed but to return to mr george and rollo they engaged a vetturino for the first time at florence mr george had gone to florence chiefly for the purpose of examining the immense collections of paintings and statuary which exist there rollo went not on account of the paintings or statues for he did not care much about such things but because he liked to go any where where he could see new places and be entertained by new scenes accordingly while mr george was at work in the galleries of florence studying by the help of catalogues the famous specimens of ancient art rollo was usually rambling about the streets observing the manners and customs of the people and watching the singular and curious scenes that every where met his eye the reason why there are so many paintings and sculptures in italy is this in the middle ages it was the fashion in all the central parts of europe for the people to spend almost all their surplus money in building and decorating churches indeed there was then very little else that they could do at the present time people invest their funds as fast as they accumulate them in building ships and railroads docks for the storage of merchandise houses and stores in cities to let for the sake of the rent and country seats or pretty private residences of various kinds for themselves but in the middle ages very little could be done in the way of investments like these there were no railroads and there was very little use for ships there was no profit to be gained by building houses and stores for there were so many wars and commotions among the people of the different towns and kingdoms that nothing was stable or safe for the same reason it was useless for men to spend their money in building and ornamenting their own houses for at the first approach of an enemy the town in which they lived was likely to be sacked and their houses and all the fine furniture which they might contain would be burned or destroyed but the churches were safe the people of the different countries had so much veneration for sacred places and for every thing connected with religion that they were afraid to touch or injure any thing that had been consecrated to a religious use to plunder a church or a convent or an abbey or to do any thing to injure or destroy the property that they contained was regarded as sacrilege and sacrilege they deemed a dreadful crime abhorred by god and man thus while they would burn and destroy hundreds of dwellings without any remorse and turn the wretched inmates out at midnight into the streets to die of exposure terror and despair they would stop at once when they came to the church afraid to harm it in any way or to touch the least thing that it contained accordingly while every thing else in a conquered town was doomed to the most reckless destruction all that was in the church the most delicate paintings and the most costly gold and silver images and utensils were as safe as if they were surrounded by impregnable castle walls of course these notions were very mistaken ones according to the teachings of our lord and saviour jesus christ it must be a greater sin to burn down the cottage of a poor widow and turn her out at midnight into the streets to die than to plunder for gain the richest altar in the world from these and various other similar causes it happened that in the middle ages that is from five hundred to a thousand years ago almost all the great expenditures of money in all the great cities and towns of europe were made for churches sometimes these churches were so

faithfully served the ships with apples and cakes and fowls and beer and halfpenny dips and beef for the generous mess where the officers dine at nights and fine fresh peppermint drops for the rollicking midshipmites of all the kind commanders who anchored in portsmouth bay by far the sweetest of all was kind lieutenant belaye lieutenant belaye commanded the gunboat hot cross bun she was seven and thirty feet in length and she carried a gun with a laudable view of enhancing his country s naval pride when people inquired her size lieutenant belaye replied oh my ship my ship is the first of the hundred and seventy ones which meant her tonnage but people imagined it meant her guns whenever i went on board he would beckon me down below come down little buttercup come for he loved to call me so and he d tell of the fights at sea in which he d taken a part and so lieutenant belaye won poor poll pineapple s heart but at length his orders came and he said one day said he i m ordered to sail with the hot cross bun to the german sea and the portsmouth maidens wept when they learnt the evil day for every portsmouth maid loved good lieutenant belaye and i went to a back back street with plenty of cheap cheap shops and i bought an oilskin hat and a second hand suit of slops and i went to lieutenant belaye and he never suspected me and i entered myself as a chap as wanted to go to sea we sailed that afternoon at the mystic hour of one remarkably nice young men were the crew of the hot cross bun i m sorry to say that i ve heard that sailors sometimes swear but i never yet heard a bun say anything wrong i declare when jack tars meet they meet with a messmate ho what cheer but here on the hot cross bun it was how do you do my dear when jack tars growl i believe they growl with a big big d but the strongest oath of the hot cross buns was a mild dear me yet though they were all well bred you could scarcely call them slick whenever a sea was on they were all extremely sick and whenever the weather was calm and the wind was light and fair they spent more time than a sailor should on his back back hair they certainly shivered and shook when ordered aloft to run and they screamed when lieutenant belaye discharged his only gun and as he was proud of his gun such pride is hardly wrong the lieutenant was blazing away at intervals all day long they all agreed very well though at times you heard it said that bill had a way of his own of making his lips look red that joe looked quite his age or somebody might declare that barnacle s long pig tail was never his own own hair belaye would admit that his men were of no great use to him but then he would say there is little to do on a gunboat trim i can hand and reef and steer and fire my big gun too and it is such a treat to sail with a gentle well bred crew i saw him every day how the happy moments sped reef topsails make all taut there s dirty weather ahead i do not mean that tempests threatened the hot cross bun in that case i don t know whatever we should have done after a fortnight s cruise we put into port one day and off on leave for a week went kind lieutenant belaye and after a long long week had passed and it seemed like a life lieutenant belaye returned to his ship with a fair young wife he up and he says says he o crew of the hot cross bun here is the wife of my heart for the church has made us one and as he uttered the word the crew went out of their wits and all fell down in so many separate fainting fits and then their hair came down or off as the case might be and lo the rest of the crew were simple girls like me who all had fled from their homes in a sailor s blue array to follow the shifting fate of kind lieutenant belaye it s strange to think that i should ever

on in these fearful terms you bring me to morrow morning early that file and them wittles you bring the lot to me at that old battery over yonder you do it and you never dare to say a word or dare to make a sign concerning your having seen such a person as me or any person sumever and you shall be let to live you fail or you go from my words in any partickler no matter how small it is and your heart and your liver shall be tore out roasted and ate now i ain t alone as you may think i am there s a young man hid with me in comparison with which young man i am a angel that young man hears the words i speak that young man has a secret way pecooliar to himself of getting at a boy and at his heart and at his liver it is in wain for a boy to attempt to hide himself from that young man a boy may lock his door may be warm in bed may tuck himself up may draw the clothes over his head may think himself comfortable and safe but that young man will softly creep and creep his way to him and tear him open i am a keeping that young man from harming of you at the present moment with great difficulty i find it wery hard to hold that young man off of your inside now what do you say i said that i would get him the file and i would get him what broken bits of food i could and i would come to him at the battery early in the morning say lord strike you dead if you don t said the man i said so and he took me down now he pursued you remember what you ve undertook and you remember that young man and you get home goo good night sir i faltered much of that said he glancing about him over the cold wet flat i wish i was a frog or a eel at the same time he hugged his shuddering body in both his arms clasping himself as if to hold himself together and limped towards the low church wall as i saw him go picking his way among the nettles and among the brambles that bound the green mounds he looked in my young eyes as if he were eluding the hands of the dead people stretching up cautiously out of their graves to get a twist upon his ankle and pull him in when he came to the low church wall he got over it like a man whose legs were numbed and stiff and then turned round to look for me when i saw him turning i set my face towards home and made the best use of my legs but presently i looked over my shoulder and saw him going on again towards the river still hugging himself in both arms and picking his way with his sore feet among the great stones dropped into the marshes here and there for stepping places when the rains were heavy or the tide was in the marshes were just a long black horizontal line then as i stopped to look after him and the river was just another horizontal line not nearly so broad nor yet so black and the sky was just a row of long angry red lines and dense black lines intermixed on the edge of the river i could faintly make out the only two black things in all the prospect that seemed to be standing upright one of these was the beacon by which the sailors steered like an unhooped cask upon a pole an ugly thing when you were near it the other a gibbet with some chains hanging to it which had once held a pirate the man was limping on towards this latter as if he were the pirate come to life and come down and going back to hook himself up again it gave me a terrible turn when i thought so and as i saw the cattle lifting their heads to gaze after him i wondered whether they thought so too i looked all round for the horrible young man and could see no signs of him but now i was frightened again and ran home without stopping chapter ii my sister mrs joe gargery was more than twenty years older than i and had established a great reputation with herself and the neighbors because she had brought me up by hand having at that time to find out for myself what the expression meant and knowing her to have a hard and heavy hand and to be much in the habit of laying it upon her husband as well as upon me i supposed that joe gargery and i were both brought up by hand she was not a good looking woman my sister and i had a general impression that she must have made joe gargery marry her by hand joe was a fair man with curls of flaxen hair on each side of his smooth face and with eyes of such a very undecided blue that they seemed to have somehow got mixed with their own whites he was a mild good natured sweet tempered easy going foolish dear fellow a sort of hercules in strength and also in weakness my sister mrs joe with black hair and eyes had such a prevailing redness of skin that i sometimes used to wonder whether it was possible she washed herself with a nutmeg grater instead of soap she was tall and bony and almost always wore a coarse apron fastened over her figure behind with two loops and having a square impregnable bib in front that was stuck full of pins and needles she made it a powerful merit in herself and a strong reproach against joe that she wore this apron so much though i really see no reason why she should have worn it at all or why if she did wear it at all she should not have taken it off every day of her life joe s forge adjoined our house which was a wooden house as many of the dwellings in our country were most of them at that time when i ran home from the churchyard the forge was shut up and joe was sitting alone in the kitchen joe and i being fellow sufferers and having confidences as such joe imparted a confidence to me the moment i raised the latch of the door and peeped in at him opposite to it sitting in the chimney corner mrs joe has been out a dozen times

betook himself towards the ruined hermitage of mr mopes the hermit for mr mopes by suffering everything about him to go to ruin and by dressing himself in a blanket and skewer and by steeping himself in soot and grease and other nastiness had acquired great renown in all that country side far greater renown than he could ever have won for himself if his career had been that of any ordinary christian or decent hottentot he had even blanketed and skewered and sooted and greased himself into the london papers and it was curious to find as mr traveller found by stopping for a new direction at this farm house or at that cottage as he went along with how much accuracy the morbid mopes had counted on the weakness of his neighbours to embellish him a mist of home brewed marvel and romance surrounded mopes in which as in all fogs the real proportions of the real object were extravagantly heightened he had murdered his beautiful beloved in a fit of jealousy and was doing penance he had made a vow under the influence of grief he had made a vow under the influence of a fatal accident he had made a vow under the influence of religion he had made a vow under the influence of drink he had made a vow under the influence of disappointment he had never made any vow but had got led into it by the possession of a mighty and most awful secret he was enormously rich he was stupendously charitable he was profoundly learned he saw spectres he knew and could do all kinds of wonders some said he went out every night and was met by terrified wayfarers stalking along dark roads others said he never went out some knew his penance to be nearly expired others had positive information that his seclusion was not a penance at all and would never expire but with himself even as to the easy facts of how old he was or how long he had held verminous occupation of his blanket and skewer no consistent information was to be got from those who must know if they would he was represented as being all the ages between five and twenty and sixty and as having been a hermit seven years twelve twenty thirty though twenty on the whole appeared the favourite term well well said mr traveller at any rate let us see what a real live hermit looks like so mr traveller went on and on and on until he came to tom tiddler s ground it was a nook in a rustic by road which the genius of mopes had laid waste as completely as if he had been born an emperor and a conqueror its centre object was a dwelling house sufficiently substantial all the window glass of which had been long ago abolished by the surprising genius of mopes and all the windows of which were barred across with rough split logs of trees nailed over them on the outside a rickyard hip high in vegetable rankness and ruin contained outbuildings from which the thatch had lightly fluttered away on all the winds of all the seasons of the year and from which the planks and beams had heavily dropped and rotted the frosts and damps of winter and the heats of summer had warped what wreck remained so that not a post or a board retained the position it was meant to hold but everything was twisted from its purpose like its owner and degraded and debased in this homestead of the sluggard behind the ruined hedge and sinking away among the ruined grass and the nettles were the last perishing fragments of certain ricks which had gradually mildewed and collapsed until they looked like mounds of rotten honeycomb or dirty sponge tom tiddler s ground could even show its ruined water for there was a slimy pond into which a tree or two had fallen one soppy trunk and branches lay across it then which in its accumulation of stagnant weed and in its black decomposition and in all its foulness and filth was almost comforting regarded as the only water that could have reflected the shameful place without seeming polluted by that low office mr traveller looked all around him on tom tiddler s ground and his glance at last encountered a dusky tinker lying among the weeds and rank grass in the shade of the dwelling house a rough walking staff lay on the ground by his side and his head rested on a small wallet he met mr traveller s eye without lifting up his head merely depressing his chin a little for he was lying on his back to get a better view of him good day said mr traveller same to you if you like it returned the tinker don t you like it it s a very fine day i ain t partickler in weather returned the tinker with a yawn mr traveller had walked up to where he lay and was looking down at him this is a curious place said mr traveller ay i suppose so returned the tinker tom tiddler s ground they call this are you well acquainted with it never saw it afore to day said the tinker with another yawn and don t care if i never see it again there was a man here just now told me what it was called if you want to see tom himself you must go in at that gate he faintly indicated with his chin a little mean ruin of a wooden gate at the side of the house have you seen tom no and i ain t partickler to see him i can see a dirty man anywhere he does not live in the house then said mr traveller casting his eyes upon the house anew the man said returned the tinker rather irritably him as was here just now this what you re a laying on mate is tom tiddler s ground and if you want to see tom he says you must go in at that gate the man come out at that gate himself and he ought to know certainly said mr traveller though perhaps exclaimed the tinker so struck by the brightness of his own idea that it had the electric effect upon him of causing him to lift up his head an inch or so perhap

the foregoing prediction may seem the facts of the last half century will we think justify it if the manhattan towns or manhattan as we shall not scruple to term the several places that compose the prosperous sisterhood at the mouth of the hudson a name that is more ancient and better adapted to the history associations and convenience of the place than any other continue to prosper as they have done ere the close of the present century they will take their station among the capitals of the first rank it may require a longer period to collect the accessories of a first class place for these are the products of time and cultivation though the facilities of intercourse the spirit of the age and the equalizing sentiment that marks the civilization of the epoch will greatly hasten everything in the shape of improvement new york will probably never possess any churches of an architecture to attract attention for their magnitude and magnificence the policy of the country which separates religion from the state precludes this by confining all the expenditures of this nature to the several parishes few of which are rich enough to do more than erect edifices of moderate dimensions and cost the romish church so much addicted to addressing the senses manifests some desire to construct its cathedrals but they are necessarily confined to the limits and ornaments suited to the resources of a branch of the church that in this country is by no means affluent the manner in which the americans are subdivided into sects also conflicts with any commendable desire that may exist to build glorious temples in honor of the deity and convenience is more consulted than taste perhaps in all that relates to ecclesiastical architecture nevertheless a sensible improvement in this respect has occurred within the last few years to which we shall elsewhere advert it will be in their trade their resources their activity and their influence on the rest of the world as well as in their population that the towns of manhattan will be first entitled to rank with the larger capitals of europe so obvious rapid and natural has been the advance of all the places that it is not easy for the mind to regard anything belonging to them as extraordinary or out of rule there is not a port in the whole country that is less indebted to art and the fostering hand of government than this it is true certain forts most of them of very doubtful necessity have been constructed for defence but no attack having ever been contemplated or if contemplated attempted they have been dead letters in the history of its progress we are not aware that government has ever expended one cent in the waters of manhattan except for the surveys construction of the aforesaid military works and the erection of the lighthouses that form a part of the general provision for the safe navigation of the entire coast some money has been expended for the improvement of the shallow waters of the hudson but it has been as much or more for the advantage of the upper towns and the trade coastwise generally than for the special benefit of new york the immense natural advantages of the bays and islands at the mouth of the hudson have in a great degree superseded the necessity of such assistance nature has made every material provision for a mart of the first importance and perhaps it has been fortunate that the towns have been left like healthful and vigorous children managed by prudent parents to take the inclination and growth pointed out to them by this safest and best of guides london is indebted to artificial causes in a great degree for its growth and power that great law of trade which renders settling places indispensable has contributed to her prosperity and continued ascendency long after the day when rival ports are carrying away her fleets and commerce she is a proof of the difficulty of shaking a commercial superiority long established scarce a cargo that enters the ports of the kingdom that does not pay tribute to her bankers or merchants but london is a political capital and that in a country where the representation of the government is more imposing possessing greater influence than in any other christian nation the english aristocracy which wields the real authority of the state here makes its annual exhibition of luxury and wealth such as the world has never beheld anywhere else ancient rome possibly excepted and has had a large share in rendering london what it is new york has none of this adventitious aid both of the governments that of the united states and that of the state have long been taken from her leaving her nothing of this sort but her own local authorities but representation forms no part of the machinery of american policy it is supposed that man is too intellectual and philosophical to need it in this intellectual and philosophical country par excellence although such is the theory the whole struggle in private life is limited to the impression made by representation in the hands of individuals that which the government has improvidently cast aside society has seized upon and hundreds who have no claim to distinction beyond the possession of money profit by the mistake to place themselves in positions perhaps that they are not always exactly qualified to fill of all social usurpations that of mere money is the least tolerable as one may have a very full purse with empty brains and vulgar tastes and habits the wisdom of thus throwing the control of a feature of society that is of much more moment than is commonly supposed into the chapter of commercial accidents may well he questioned some crude attempts have been made to bring the circles of new york within the control of a code

out there where he is sitting well said mrs kennedy hesitating and looking very timid well waldron may go a little while but waldron you must be sure and stay by mr george or at least not go any where without his leave yes said waldron i will so he and rollo went away and walked leisurely towards the place where mr george was sitting i am glad we are coming up this river to greenock and glasgow said waldron why asked rollo because of the steamboats said waldron do they build a great many steamboats in greenock and glasgow asked rollo yes said waldron this is the greatest place for building steamboats in the world except new york said rollo o of course except new york replied waldron but they build all the big english steamers in this river all the cunarders were built here and they have got some of the best machine shops and founderies here that there are in the world i should like to go all about and see them if i could only get away from my mother why won t she let you go said rollo no replied waldron not if she knows it she thinks i am a little boy and is so afraid that i shall get hurt waldron pronounced the word hurt in a drawling and contemptuous tone which was so comical that rollo could not help laughing outright i go to all the ship yards and founderies in new york whenever i please continued waldron i go when she does not know it sometimes the men let me help them carry out the melted iron and pour it into the moulds by this time the two boys had reached the place where mr george was he was sitting on what is called a camp stool and was engaged in reading his guide book and studying the map with a view of finding out what route it would be best to take in the tour they were about making in scotland mr george drew the boys into conversation with him on the subject his object was to become acquainted with waldron and find out what sort of a boy he was where do you wish to go waldron said mr george why i want to stay here a good many days said waldron to see the steamers and the dockyards they are building a monstrous iron ship somewhere here she is going to be five hundred tons bigger than the baltic i should like to see her said mr george as he said this he kept his eye upon his map following his finger as he moved it about from place to place as if he was studying out a good way to go there is edinburgh said mr george we must certainly go to edinburgh yes said waldron i suppose that is a pretty great place besides i want to see the houses twelve stories high and there is linlithgow continued mr george still looking upon his map that is the place where mary queen of scots was born waldron would you like to go there why no said waldron doubtfully not much i don t care much about that it is a famous old ruin said mr george but i don t care much about the old ruins said waldron if the lords and noblemen are as rich as people say they are i should think they would mend them up and here off in the western part of scotland continued mr george are a great many mountains would you like to go and see the mountains no sir said waldron not particularly then in a moment he added can we go up to the top of them mr george yes said mr george we can go to the top of some of them the highest asked waldron yes said mr george ben nevis i believe is the highest we can go to the top of that then i should like to go said waldron eagerly unless continued mr george it should rain too hard o i should not care for the rain said waldron it s good fun to go in the rain while this conversation had been going on waldron had been looking this way and that at the various ships and steamers that were gliding about on the water examining carefully the building of each one and watching her motions he now proposed that rollo should go forward to the bridge with him where they could have a better lookout well said rollo so the two boys went together to the bridge the bridge was a sort of narrow platform extending across the steamer from one paddle wheel to the other for the captain or pilot to walk upon in order to see how the steamer was going and to direct the steering when they are in the open sea any of the passengers are allowed to walk here but in coming into port or into a river crowded with shipping then a notice is put up requesting passengers not to go upon the bridge inasmuch as at such times it is required for the exclusive use of the captain and pilot this notice was up when waldron and rollo reached the bridge see said rollo pointing at the notice we cannot go there o never mind that said waldron they ll let us go they only mean that they don t want too many there that s all but rollo would not go mr george had accustomed him in travelling about the world always to obey all lawful rules and orders and particularly every direction of this kind which he might find in public places some people are very much inclined to crowd upon the line of such rules and even to encroach upon them till they actually encounter some resistance to drive them back they do this partly to show their independence and importance but mr george was not one of this sort so rollo would not go upon the bridge then let us go out on the forecastle said waldron he pointed as he spoke to the forecastle which is a small raised deck at the bows of a steamer where there is an excellent place to see no said rollo i will not go on the forecastle either uncle george s rule for me on board ship is that i may go where i see other gentlemanly passengers go and nowhere else the passenger

was as worthy of note as the ultimate object to which you were journeying it is possible indeed that coleridge did not in fact possess the precise gladiatorial power of johnson yet he understood a sword play of his own and i have upon several occasions seen him exhibit brilliant proofs of its effectiveness upon disputants of considerable pretensions in their particular lines but he had a genuine dislike of the practice in himself or others and no slight provocation could move him to any such exertion he was indeed to my observation more distinguished from other great men of letters by his moral thirst after the truth the ideal truth in his own mind than by his merely intellectual qualifications to leave the everyday circle of society in which the literary and scientific rarely the rest never break through the spell of personality where anecdote reigns everlastingly paramount and exclusive and the mildest attempt to generalize the babel of facts and to control temporary and individual phenomena by the application of eternal and overruling principles is unintelligible to many and disagreeable to more to leave this species of converse if converse it deserves to be called and pass an entire day with coleridge was a marvellous change indeed it was a sabbath past expression deep and tranquil and serene you came to a man who had travelled in many countries and in critical times who had seen and felt the world in most of its ranks and in many of its vicissitudes and weaknesses one to whom all literature and genial art were absolutely subject and to whom with a reasonable allowance as to technical details all science was in a most extraordinary degree familiar throughout a long drawn summer s day would this man talk to you in low equable but clear and musical tones concerning things human and divine marshalling all history harmonizing all experiment probing the depths of your consciousness and revealing visions of glory and of terror to the imagination but pouring withal such floods of light upon the mind that you might for a season like paul become blind in the very act of conversion and this he would do without so much as one allusion to himself without a word of reflection on others save when any given act fell naturally in the way of his discourse without one anecdote that was not proof and illustration of a previous position gratifying no passion indulging no caprice but with a calm mastery over your soul leading you onward and onward for ever through a thousand windings yet with no pause to some magnificent point in which as in a focus all the party coloured rays of his discourse should converge in light in all this he was in truth your teacher and guide but in a little while you might forget that he was other than a fellow student and the companion of your way so playful was his manner so simple his language so affectionate the glance of his pleasant eye there were indeed some whom coleridge tired and some whom he sent asleep it would occasionally so happen when the abstruser mood was strong upon him and the visiter was narrow and ungenial i have seen him at times when you could not incarnate him when he shook aside your petty questions or doubts and burst with some impatience through the obstacles of common conversation then escaped from the flesh he would soar upwards into an atmosphere almost too rare to breathe but which seemed proper to him and there he would float at ease like enough what coleridge then said his subtlest listener would not understand as a man understands a newspaper but upon such a listener there would steal an influence and an impression and a sympathy there would be a gradual attempering of his body and spirit till his total being vibrated with one pulse alone and thought became merged in contemplation and so his senses gradually wrapt in a half sleep he d dream of better worlds and dreaming hear thee still o singing lark that sangest like an angel in the clouds but it would be a great mistake to suppose that the general character of mr coleridge s conversation was abstruse or rhapsodical the contents of the following pages may i think be taken as pretty strong presumptive evidence that his ordinary manner was plain and direct enough and even when as sometimes happened he seemed to ramble from the road and to lose himself in a wilderness of digressions the truth was that at that very time he was working out his fore known conclusion through an almost miraculous logic the difficulty of which consisted precisely in the very fact of its minuteness and universality he took so large a scope that if he was interrupted before he got to the end he appeared to have been talking without an object although perhaps a few steps more would have brought you to a point a retrospect from which would show you the pertinence of all he had been saying i have heard persons complain that they could get no answer to a question from coleridge the truth is he answered or meant to answer so fully that the querist should have no second question to ask in nine cases out of ten he saw the question was short or misdirected and knew that a mere yes or no answer could not embrace the truth that is the whole truth and might very probably by implication convey error hence that exhaustive cyclical mode of discoursing in which he frequently indulged unfit indeed for a dinner table and too long breathed for the patience of a chance visiter but which to those who knew for what they came was the object of their profoundest admiration as it was the

the windows or came puffing out of the chimney tops and incapable of participation in any of the good things that were constantly being handled through the street doors and the area railings to

me oh mr clavering i did not imagine that your strength would have condescended to take such advantage over the weakness of a woman i remember no oaths of any kind and what foolish assertions i may

deprive you perhaps i also may sometimes look back but i shall never speak of that time again and you if you are as noble as i take you to be will not speak of it either i know you would not wish to injure me i would wish to save you from the misery you are bringing on yourself in that you must allow me to look after myself lord ongar certainly wants a wife and i intend to be true to him and useful how about love and to love him sir do you think that no man can win a woman s love unless he is filled to the brim with poetry and has a neck like lord byron and is handsome like your worship you are very handsome harry and you too should go into the market and make the best of yourself why should you not learn to love some nice girl that has money to assist you julia no sir i will not be called julia if you do i will be insulted and leave you instantly i may call you harry as being so much younger though we were born in the same month and as a sort of cousin but i shall never do that after to day you have courage enough then to tell me that you have not ill used me certainly i have why what a fool you would have me be look at me and tell me whether i am fit to be the wife of such a one as you by the time you are entering the world i shall be an old woman and shall have lived my life even if i were fit to be your mate when we were living here together am i fit after what i have

everything for yourself but nothing is anything without your love pshaw love indeed what could it do for you but ruin you you know it as well as i do but you are selfish enough to wish to continue a romance which would be absolutely destructive to me though for a while it might afford a pleasant relaxation to your graver studies harry you can choose in the world you have divinity and law and

they could not grow any older and then they stood still and lasted from generation to generation there was too an unchangeability about all the externals of newbury here was a red house and there was a brown house and across the way was a yellow house and there was a straggling rail fence or a tribe of mullein stalks between the minister lived here and squire moses lived there and deacon hart

other read their bibles feared their god and were content with such things as they had the best philosophy after all such was the place into which master james benton made an irruption in the year eighteen hundred and no matter what now this james is to be our hero and he is just the hero for a sensation at least so you would have thought if you had been in newbury the week after his arrival master james was one of those whole hearted energetic yankees who rise in the world as naturally as cork does in water he possessed a great share of that characteristic national trait so happily denominated cuteness which signifies an ability to do every thing without trying and to know every thing without learning and to make more use of one s ignorance than other people do of their knowledge this quality in james was mingled with an elasticity of animal spirits a buoyant cheerfulness of mind which though found in the new england character perhaps as often as any where else is not ordinarily regarded as one of its distinguishing traits as to the personal appearance of our hero we have not much to say of it not half so much as the girls in newbury found it necessary to remark the first sabbath that he shone out in the meeting house there was a saucy frankness of countenance a knowing roguery of eye a joviality and prankishness of demeanor that was wonderfully captivating especially to the ladies it is true that master james had an uncommonly comfortable opinion of himself a full faith that there was nothing in creation that he could not learn and could not do and this faith was maintained with an abounding and triumphant joyfulness that fairly carried your sympathies along with him and made you feel quite as much delighted with his qualifications and prospects as he felt himself there are two kinds of self sufficiency one is amusing and the other is provoking his was the amusing kind it seemed in truth to be only the buoyancy and overflow of a vivacious mind delighted with every thing delightful in himself or others he was always ready to magnify his own praise but quite as ready to exalt his neighbor if the channel of discourse ran that way his own perfections being more completely within his knowledge he rejoiced in them more constantly but if those of any one else came within the same range he was quite as much astonished and edified as if they had been his own master james at the time of his transit to the town of newbury was only eighteen years of age so that it was difficult to say which predominated in him most the boy or the man the belief that he could and the determination that he would be something in the world had caused him to abandon his home and with all his worldly effects tied in a blue cotton pocket handkerchief to proceed to seek his fortune in newbury and never did stranger in yankee village rise to promotion with more unparalleled rapidity or boast a greater plurality of employment he figured as schoolmaster all the week and as chorister on sundays and taught singing and reading in the evenings besides studying latin and greek with the minister nobody knew when thus fitting for college while he seemed to be doing every thing else in the world besides james understood every art and craft of popularity and made himself mightily at home in all the chimney corners of the region round about knew the geography of every body s cider barrel and apple bin helping himself and every one else therefrom with all bountifulness rejoicing in the good things of this life devouring the old ladies doughnuts and pumpkin pies with most flattering appetite and appearing equally to relish every body and thing that came in his way the degree and versatility of his acquirements were truly wonderful he knew all about arithmetic and history and all about catching squirrels and planting corn made poetry and hoe handles with equal celerity wound yarn and took out grease spots for old ladies and made nosegays and knickknacks for young ones caught trout saturday afternoons and discussed doctrines on sundays with equal adroitness and effect in short mr james moved on through the place victorious happy and glorious welcomed and privileged by every body in every place and when he had told his last ghost story and fairly flourished himself out of doors at the close of a long winter s evening you might see the hard face of the good man of the house

companion he had an ample stock of anecdote about the neighborhood which he had learned from his father and many quaint remarks and sly jokes evidently derived from the same source all which were uttered with a scottish accent and a mixture of scottish phraseology that gave them additional flavor on our way to the abbey he gave me some anecdotes of johnny bower to whom his father had alluded he was sexton of the parish and custodian of the ruin employed to keep it in order and show it to strangers a worthy little man not without ambition in his humble sphere the death of his predecessor had been mentioned in the newspapers so that his name had appeared in print throughout the land when johnny succeeded to the guardianship of the ruin he stipulated that on his death his name should receive like honorable blazon with this addition that it should be from the pen of scott the latter gravely pledged himself to pay this tribute to his memory and johnny now lived in the proud anticipation of a poetic immortality i found johnny bower a decent looking little old man in blue coat and red waistcoat he received us with much greeting and seemed delighted to see my young companion who was full of merriment and waggery drawing out his peculiarities for my amusement the old man was one of the most authentic and particular of cicerones he pointed out everything in the abbey that had been described by scott in his lay of the last minstrel and would repeat with broad scottish accent the passage which celebrated it thus in passing through the cloisters he made me remark the beautiful carvings of leaves and flowers wrought in stone with the most exquisite delicacy and notwithstanding the lapse of centuries retaining their sharpness as if fresh from the chisel rivalling as scott has said the real objects of which they were imitations nor herb nor flowret glistened there but was carved in the cloister arches as fair he pointed out also among the carved work a nun s head of much beauty which he said scott always stopped to admire for the shirra had a wonderful eye for all sic matters i would observe that scott seemed to derive more consequence in the neighborhood from being sheriff of the county than from being poet in the interior of the abbey johnny bower conducted me to the identical stone on which stout william of deloraine and the monk took their seat on that memorable night when the wizard s book was to be rescued from the grave nay johnny had even gone beyond scott in the minuteness of his antiquarian research for he had discovered the very tomb of the wizard the position of which had been left in doubt by the poet this he boasted to have ascertained by the position of the oriel window and the direction in which the moonbeams fell at night through the stained glass casting the shadow to the red cross on the spot as had all been specified in the poem i pointed out the whole to the shirra said he and he could na gainsay but it was varra clear i found afterward that scott used to amuse himself with the simplicity of the old man and his zeal in verifying every passage of the poem as though it had authentic history and that he always acquiesced in his deductions i subjoin the description of the wizard s grave which called forth the antiquarian research of johnny bower lo warrior now the cross of red points to the grave of the mighty dead slow moved the monk to the broad flag stone which the bloody cross was traced upon he pointed to a sacred nook an iron bar the warrior took and the monk made a sign with his withered hand the grave s huge portal to expand it was by dint of passing strength that he moved the massy stone at length i would you had been there to see how the light broke forth so gloriously streamed upward to the chancel roof and through the galleries far aloof and issuing from the tomb showed the monk s cowl and visage pale danced on the dark brown warrior s mail and kissed his waving plume before their eyes the wizard lay as if he had not been dead a day his hoary beard in silver rolled he seemed some seventy winters old a palmer s amice wrapped him round with a wrought spanish baldrie bound like a pilgrim from beyond the sea his left hand held his book of might a silver cross was in his right the lamp was placed beside his knee the fictions of scott had become facts with honest johnny bower from constantly living among the ruins of melrose abbey and pointing out the scenes of the poem the lay of the last minstrel had in a manner become interwoven with his whole existence and i doubt whether he did not now and then mix up his own identity with the personages of some of its cantos he could not bear that any other production of the poet should be preferred to the lay of the last minstrel faith said he to me it s just e en as gude a thing as mr scott has written an if he were stannin there i d tell him so an then he d lauff he was loud in his praises of the affability of scott he ll come here sometimes said he with great folks in his company an the first i know of it is his voice calling out johnny johnny bower and when i go out i am sure to be greeted with a joke or

on boney s boots before the century was actually in its teens we believe that george cruikshank was amusing the public in those great colored prints in our grandfathers portfolios in the library and in some other apartments of the house where the caricatures used to be pasted in those days we found things quite beyond our comprehension boney was represented as a fierce dwarf with goggle eyes a huge laced hat and tricolored plume a crooked sabre reeking with blood a little demon revelling in lust murder massacre john bull was shown kicking him a good deal indeed he was prodigiously kicked

the best arrangement of clauses in a sentence in the proper order of its principal and subordinate propositions in the judicious use of simile metaphor and other figures of speech and even in the rhythmical sequence of syllables ii economy in the use of words the greater forcibleness of saxon english or rather non latin english first claims our attention the several special reasons assignable for this may all be reduced to the general reason economy the most important of them is early association a child s vocabulary is almost wholly saxon he says i have not i possess i wish not i desire he does not reflect he thinks he does not beg for amusement but for play he calls things nice or nasty not pleasant or disagreeable the synonyms which he learns in after years never become so closely so organically connected with the ideas signified as do these original words used in childhood and hence the association remains less strong but in what does a strong association between a word and an idea differ from a weak one simply in the greater ease and rapidity of the suggestive action it can be in nothing else both of two words if they be strictly synonymous eventually call up the same image the expression it is acid must in the end give rise to the same thought as it is sour but because the term acid was learnt later in life and has not been so often followed by the thought symbolized it does not so readily arouse that thought as the term sour if we remember how slowly and with what labour the appropriate ideas follow unfamiliar words in another language and how increasing familiarity with such words brings greater rapidity and ease of comprehension and if we consider that the same process must have gone on with the words of our mother tongue from childhood upwards we shall clearly see that the earliest learnt and oftenest used words will other things equal call up images with less loss of time and energy than their later learnt synonyms the further superiority possessed by saxon english in its comparative brevity obviously comes under the same generalization if it be an advantage to express an idea in the smallest number of words then will it be an advantage to express it in the smallest number of syllables if circuitous phrases and needless expletives distract the attention and diminish the strength of the impression produced then do surplus articulations do so a certain effort though commonly an inappreciable one must be required to recognize every vowel and consonant if as all know it is tiresome to listen to an indistinct speaker or read a badly written manuscript and if as we cannot doubt the fatigue is a cumulative result of the attention needed to catch successive syllables it follows that attention is in such cases absorbed by each syllable and if this be true when the syllables are difficult of recognition it will also be true though in a less degree when the recognition of them is easy hence the shortness of saxon words becomes a reason for their greater force one qualification however must not be overlooked a word which in itself embodies the most important part of the idea to be conveyed especially when that idea is an emotional one may often with advantage be a polysyllabic word thus it seems more forcible to say it is magnificent than it is grand the word vast is not so powerful a one as stupendous calling a thing nasty is not so effective as calling it disgusting there seem to be several causes for this exceptional superiority of certain long words we may ascribe it partly to the fact that a voluminous mouth filling epithet is by its very size suggestive of largeness or strength witness the immense pomposity of sesquipedalian verbiage and when great power or intensity has to be suggested this association of ideas aids the effect a further cause may be that a word of several syllables admits of more emphatic articulation and as emphatic articulation is a sign of emotion the unusual impressiveness of the thing named is implied by it yet another cause is that a long word of which the latter syllables are generally inferred as soon as the first are spoken allows the hearer s consciousness a longer time to dwell upon the quality predicated and where as in the above cases it is to this predicated quality that the entire attention is called an advantage results from keeping it before the mind for an appreciable time the reasons which we have given for preferring short words evidently do not hold here so that to make our generalization quite correct we must say that while in certain sentences expressing strong feeling the word which more especially implies that feeling may often with advantage be a many syllabled or latin one in the immense majority of cases each word serving but as a step to the idea embodied by the whole sentence should if possible be a one syllabled or saxon one once more that frequent cause of strength in saxon and other primitive words their imitative character may be similarly resolved into the more general cause both those directly imitative as splash bang whiz roar c and those analogically imitative as rough smooth keen blunt thin hard crag c have a greater or less likeness to the things symbolized and by making on the senses impressions allied to the ideas to be called up they save part of the effort needed to call up such ideas and leave more attention for the ideas themselves the economy of the recipient s mental energy into which are thus resolvable the several causes of the strength of saxon english may equally be traced in the superiority of specific over generic words that concrete terms produce more vivid impressions than abstract ones and should when possi

there make one at his charming gratis exhibition there used to be a crowd round the window in those days of grinning good natured mechanics who spelt the songs and spoke them out for the benefit of

is a dullard and has no heart even the old dandy of sixty must have laughed at his own wondrous grotesque image as they say louis philippe did who saw all the caricatures that were made of himself and there are some of cruikshank s designs which have the blessed faculty of creating laughter as often as you see them as diggory says in the play who is bidden by his master not to laugh while waiting at table don t tell the story of grouse in the gun room master or i can t help laughing repeat that history ever so often and at the proper moment honest diggory is sure to explode every man no doubt who loves cruikshank has his grouse in the gun room there is a fellow in the points of humor who is offering to eat up a certain little general that has made us happy any time these sixteen years his huge mouth is a perpetual well of laughter buckets full of fun can be drawn from it we have formed no such friendships as that boyish one of the man with the mouth but though in our eyes mr cruikshank reached his apogee some eighteen years since it must not be imagined that such is really the case eighteen sets of children have since then learned to love and admire him and may many more of their successors be brought up in the same delightful faith it is not the artist who fails but the men who grow cold the men from whom the illusions why illusions realities of youth disappear one by one who

of clown and harlequin but he like them is certainly the children s friend his drawings abound in feeling for these little ones and hideous as in the course of his duty he is from time to time

with the most brilliant eye but that is no fiction and the greyest hair in all the world who wrote not because he cared to write not because he cared for the wonder and admiration of his fellow men

triumph and which england delighted to honour one of the gifted of the earth has passed away as it were yesterday one who was devoted to his art and his art was nature i mean david wilkie he was one who made the cottage hearth a graceful thing of whom it might truly be said that he found books in the running brooks and who has left in all he did some breathing of the air which stirs the heather but however desirous to enlarge on his genius as an artist i would rather speak of him now as a friend who has gone from amongst us there is his deserted studio the empty easel lying idly by the unfinished picture with its face turned to the wall and there is that bereaved sister who loved him with an affection which death cannot quench he has left a name in fame clear as the bright sky he has filled our minds with memories pure as the blue waves which roll over him let us hope that she who more than all others mourns his loss may learn to reflect that he died in the fulness of his time

chamber was a squat metal cylinder a great ugly cone of dark gray technicians circled around it wiring up the exposed relay banks reinhart caught a glimpse of endless tubes and filaments a maze of wires and terminals and parts criss crossing each other layer on layer what is it reinhart perched on the edge of a workbench leaning his big shoulders against the wall an idea of jamison hedge the same man who developed our instantaneous interstellar vidcasts forty years ago he was trying to find a method of faster than light travel when he was killed destroyed along with most of his work after that ftl research was abandoned it looked as if there were no future in it wasn t it shown that nothing could travel faster than light the interstellar vidcasts do no hedge developed a valid ftl drive he managed to propel an object at fifty times the speed of light but as the object gained speed its length began to diminish and its mass increased this was in line with familiar twentieth century concepts of mass energy transformation we conjectured that as hedge s object gained velocity it would continue to lose length and gain mass until its length became nil and its mass infinite nobody can imagine such an object go on but what actually occurred is this hedge s object continued to lose length and gain mass until it reached the theoretical limit of velocity the speed of light at that point the object still gaining speed simply ceased to exist having no length it ceased to occupy space it disappeared however the object had not been destroyed it continued on its way gaining momentum each moment moving in an arc across the galaxy away from the sol system hedge s object entered some other realm of being beyond our powers of conception the next phase of hedge s experiment consisted in a search for some way to slow the ftl object down back to a sub ftl speed hence back into our universe this counterprinciple was eventually worked out with what result the death of hedge and destruction of most of his equipment his experimental object in re entering the space time universe came into being in space already occupied by matter possessing an incredible mass just below infinity level hedge s object exploded in a titanic cataclysm it was obvious that no space travel was possible with such a drive virtually all space contains some matter to re enter space would bring automatic destruction hedge had found his ftl drive and his counterprinciple but no one before this has been able to put them to any use reinhart walked over toward the great metal cylinder sherikov jumped down and followed him i don t get it reinhart said you said the principle is no good for space travel that s right what s this for then if the ship explodes as soon as it returns to our universe this is not a ship sherikov grinned slyly icarus is the first practical application of hedge s principles icarus is a bomb so this is our weapon reinhart said a bomb an immense bomb a bomb moving at a velocity greater than light a bomb which will not exist in our universe the centaurans won t be able to detect or stop it how could they as soon as it passes the speed of light it will cease to exist beyond all detection but icarus will be launched outside the lab on the surface he will align himself with proxima centaurus gaining speed rapidly by the time he reaches his destination he will be traveling at ftl icarus will be brought back to this universe within centaurus itself the explosion should destroy the star and wash away most of its planets including their central hub planet armun there is no way they can halt icarus once he has been launched no defense is possible nothing can stop him it is a real fact when will he be ready sherikov s eyes flickered soon exactly how soon the big pole hesitated as a matter of fact there s only one thing holding us back sherikov led reinhart around to the other side of the lab he pushed a lab guard out of the way see this he tapped a round globe open at one end the size of a grapefruit this is holding us up what is it the central control turret this thing brings icarus back to sub ftl flight at the correct moment it must be absolutely accurate icarus will be within the star only a matter of a microsecond if the turret does not function exactly icarus will pass out the other side and shoot beyond the centauran system how near completed is this turret sherikov hedged

the cage toward them slim pointed and said there s sort of a hole in the canvas red frowned how d that get there he lifted the canvas looked in and said with relief they re still there the canvas appeared to be burned worried slim you want to look or don t you slim nodded slowly he wasn t sure he wanted to after all they might be but the canvas had been jerked off and there they were two of them the way red said they were small and sort of disgusting looking the animals moved quickly as the canvas lifted and were on the side toward the youngsters red poked a cautious finger at them watch out said slim in agony they don t hurt you said red ever see anything like them no can t you see how a circus would jump at a chance to have these maybe they re too small for a circus red looked annoyed he let go the cage which swung back and forth pendulum fashion you re just trying to back out aren t you no i m not it s just they re not too small don t worry right now i ve only got one worry what s that well i ve got to keep them till the circus comes don t i i ve got to figure out what to feed them meanwhile the cage swung and the little trapped creatures clung to its bars gesturing at the youngsters with queer quick motions almost as though they were intelligent ii the astronomer entered the dining room with decorum he felt very much the guest he said where are the youngsters my son isn t in his room the industrialist smiled they ve been out for hours however breakfast was forced into them among the women some time ago so there is nothing to worry about youth doctor youth youth the word seemed to depress the astronomer they ate breakfast in silence the industrialist said once you really think they ll come the day looks so normal the astronomer said they ll come that was all afterward the industrialist said you ll pardon me i can t conceive your playing so elaborate a hoax you really spoke to them as i speak to you at least in a sense they can project thoughts i gathered that must be so from your letter how i wonder i could not say i asked them and of course they were vague or perhaps it was just that i could not understand it involves a projector for the focussing of thought and even more than that conscious attention on the part of both projector and receptor it was quite a while before i realized they were trying to think at me such thought projectors may be part of the science they will give us perhaps said the industrialist yet think of the changes it would bring to society a thought projector why not change would be good for us i don t think so it is only in old age that change is unwelcome said the astronomer and races can be old as well as individuals the industrialist pointed out the window you see that road it was built beforethewars i don t know exactly when it is as good now as the day it was built we couldn t possibly duplicate it now the race was young when that was built eh then yes at least they weren t afraid of new things no i wish they had been where is the society of beforethewars destroyed doctor what good were youth and new things we are better off now the world is peaceful and jogs along the race goes nowhere but after all there is nowhere to go they proved that the men who built the road i will speak with your visitors as i agreed if they come but i think i will only ask them to go the race is not going nowhere said the astronomer earnestly it is going toward final destruction my university has a smaller student body each year fewer books are written less work is done an old man sleeps in the sun and his days are peaceful and unchanging but each day finds him nearer death all the same well well said the industrialist no don t dismiss it listen before i wrote you i investigated your position in the planetary economy and you found me solvent interrupted the industrialist smiling why yes oh i see you are joking and yet perhaps the joke is not far off you are less solvent than your father and he was less solvent than his father perhaps your son will no longer be solvent it becomes too troublesome for the planet to support even the industries that still exist though they are toothpicks to the oak trees of beforethewars we will be back to village economy and then to what the caves and the infusion of fresh technological knowledge will be the changing of all that not just the new knowledge rather the whole effect of change of a broadening of horizons look sir i chose you to approach in this matter not only because you were rich and influential with government officials but because you had an unusual reputation for these days of daring to break with tradition our people will resist change and you would know how to handle them how to see to it that that that the youth of the race is revived yes with its atomic bombs the atomic bombs returned the astronomer need not be the end of civilization these visitors of mine had their atomic bomb or whatever their equivalent was on their own worlds and survived it because they didn t give up don t you see it wasn t the bomb that defeated us but our own shell shock this may be the last chance to reverse the process

relaxation when one is as large as i the captain nodded impatiently he sat down at his desk and folded his hands all right he said let s get started you re a wub is that correct the wub shrugged i suppose so that s what they call us the natives i mean we have our own term and you speak english you ve been in contact with earthmen before no then how do you do it speak english am i speaking english i m not conscious of speaking anything in particular i examined your mind my mind i studied the contents especially the semantic warehouse as i refer to it i see the captain said telepathy of course we are a very old race the wub said very old and very ponderous it is difficult for us to move around you can appreciate that anything so slow and heavy would be at the mercy of more agile forms of life there was no use in our relying on physical defenses how could we win too heavy to run too soft to fight too good natured to hunt for game how do you live plants vegetables we can eat almost anything we re very catholic tolerant eclectic catholic we live and let live that s how we ve gotten along the wub eyed the captain and that s why i so violently objected to this business about having me boiled i could see the image in your mind most of me in the frozen food locker some of me in the kettle a bit for your pet cat so you read minds the captain said how interesting anything else i mean what else can you do along those lines a few odds and ends the wub said absently staring around the room a nice apartment you have here captain you keep it quite neat i respect life forms that are tidy some martian birds are quite tidy they throw things out of their nests and sweep them indeed the captain nodded but to get back to the problem quite so you spoke of dining on me the taste i am told is good a little fatty but tender but how can any lasting contact be established between your people and mine if you resort to such barbaric attitudes eat me rather you should discuss questions with me philosophy the arts the captain stood up philosophy it might interest you to know that we will be hard put to find something to eat for the next month an unfortunate spoilage i know the wub nodded but wouldn t it be more in accord with your principles of democracy if we all drew straws or something along that line after all democracy is to protect the minority from just such infringements now if each of us casts one vote the captain walked to the door nuts to you he said he opened the door he opened his mouth he stood frozen his mouth wide his eyes staring his fingers still on the knob the wub watched him presently it padded out of the room edging past the captain it went down the hall deep in meditation the room was quiet so you see the wub said we have a common myth your mind contains many familiar myth symbols ishtar odysseus peterson sat silently staring at the floor he shifted in his chair go on he said please go on i find in your odysseus a figure common to the mythology of most self conscious races as i interpret it odysseus wanders as an individual aware of himself as such this is the idea of separation of separation from family and country the process of individuation but odysseus returns to his home peterson looked out the port window at the stars endless stars burning intently in the empty universe finally he goes home as must all creatures the moment of separation is a temporary period a brief journey of the soul it begins it ends the wanderer returns to land and race the door opened the wub stopped turning its great head captain franco came into the room the men behind him they hesitated at the door are you all right french said do you mean me peterson said surprised why me franco lowered his gun come over here he said to peterson get up and come here there was silence go ahead the wub said it doesn t matter peterson stood up what for it s an order peterson walked to the door french caught his arm what s going on peterson wrenched loose what s the matter with you captain franco moved toward the wub the wub looked up from where it lay in the corner pressed against the wall it is interesting the wub said that you are obsessed with the idea of eating me i wonder why get up franco said if you wish the wub rose grunting be patient it is difficult for me it stood gasping its tongue lolling foolishly shoot it now french said for god s sake peterson exclaimed jones turned to him quickly his eyes gray with fear you didn t see him like a statue standing there his mouth open if we hadn t come down he d still be there who the captain peterson stared around but he s all right now they looked at the wub standing in the middle of the room its great chest rising and falling come on franco said out of the way the men pulled aside toward the door you are quite afraid aren t you the wub said have i done anything to you i am against the idea of hurting all i have done is try to protect myself can you expect me to rush eagerly to my death i am a sensible being like yourselves i was curious to see your ship learn about you i suggested to the native the gun jerked see franco said i thought so the wub

for a bit of a run between the stations it s so dull for him poor fellow being shut up in his box all the time when he s travelling elma looked down at the beautiful glossy creature with genuine admiration his skin was like enamel his banded scales shone bright and silvery she didn t know why but somehow she felt she wasn t in the least afraid of him i suppose one ought to be repelled at once by a snake she said taking the opposite seat and keeping her glance fixed firmly upon the reptile s eye but then this is such a handsome one i can t say why but i don t feel afraid of him at all as i ought to do every right minded person detests snakes don t they and yet how exquisitely flexible and beautiful he is oh pray don t put him back in his box for me he s basking in the sun here i should be sorry to disturb him cyril waring looked at her in considerable surprise he caught the creature in his hands as he spoke and transferred it at once to a tin box with a perforated lid that lay beside him go back sardanapalus he said in a very musical and pleasant voice forcing the huge beast into the lair with gentle but masterful hands go back and go to sleep sir it s time for your nap oh no i couldn t think of letting him out any more in the carriage to the annoyance of others i m ashamed enough as it is of having unintentionally alarmed you but you came in so unexpectedly you see i hadn t time to put my queer pet away and when the door opened i was afraid he might slip out or get under the seats so all i could do was just to soothe him with my hand and keep him quiet till the door was shut to again indeed i wasn t at all afraid of him elma answered slipping her change into her pocket and looking prettier through her blush than even her usual self on the contrary i really liked to see him he s such a glorious snake the lights and shades on his back are so glancing and so wonderful he s a perfect model of course you re painting him the stranger started i m painting him yes that s true he replied with a look of sudden surprise but why of course please how on earth could you tell i was an artist even elma glanced back in his face and wondered to herself too now she came to think of it how did she know that handsome young man with the charming features and the expressive eyes and the neatly cut brown beard and the attractive manner was an artist at all or anything like it and how did she know the snake was his model for the life of her she couldn t have answered those questions herself i suppose i just guessed it she answered after a short pause blushing still more deeply at the sudden way she had thus been dragged into conversation with the good looking stranger elma s skin was dark a clear and creamy olive brown complexion such as one sometimes sees in southern europe though rarely in england and the effect of the blush through it didn t pass unnoticed by cyril waring s artistic eye he would have given something for the chance of transferring that delicious effect to canvas the delicate transparency of the blush threw up those piercing dark eyes and reflected lustre even on the glossy black hair that fringed her forehead not an english type of beauty at all elma clifford s he thought to himself as he eyed her closely rather spanish or italian or say even hungarian well you guessed right at any rate he went on settling down in his seat once more after boxing his snake but this time face to face with her i m working at a beautiful bit of fern and foliage quite tropical in its way in a wood hereabout and i ve introduced sardanapalus coiled up in the foreground just to give life to the scene don t you know and an excuse for a title i mean to call it the rajah s rest behind great ferns and a mossy bank in front sardanapalus after tiffin rolled spirally round and taking his siesta this meeting was a long wished for occasion elma had never before met a real live painter now it was the cherished idea of her youth to see something some day of that wonderful non existent fantastic world which we still hope for and dream about and call bohemia she longed to move in literary and artistic circles she had fashioned to herself like many other romantic girls a rose coloured picture of bohemian existence not knowing indeed that bohemia is now alas an extinct province since belgravia and kensington swallowed it bodily down digested and assimilated it so this casual talk with the handsome young artist in the second class carriage on the great southern line was to elma as a charming and delightful glimpse of an enchanted region she could never enter it was paradise to the peri she turned the conversation at once therefore with resolute intent upon art and artists determined to make the most while it lasted of this unique opportunity and since the subject of self with an attentive listener is always an attractive one even to modest young men like cyril waring especially when it s a pretty girl who encourages you to dilate upon it why the consequence was that before many minutes were over the handsome young man was discoursing from his full heart to a sympathetic soul about his chosen art its hopes and its ideals accompanied by a running fire of thumb nail illustrations he had even got so far in the course of their intimacy as to take out the portfolio which lay hidden under the seat out of deference to his disguise as a stock broker no doubt and to display before elma s delighted eyes with many explanatory comments as to light and shade or perspective and foreshortening the studies for the picture he had just then engaged upon by and by as his enthusiasm warmed under elma s encouragement the young

grunted here he passed it to his companions i think this is what we ve been waiting for they certainly took their time about it so they want to talk terms scott said are we going along with them that s not for us to decide hendricks sat down where s the communications officer i want the moon base leone pondered as the communications officer raised the outside antenna cautiously scanning the sky above the bunker for any sign of a watching russian ship sir scott said to hendricks it s sure strange they suddenly came around we ve been using the claws for almost a year now all of a sudden they start to fold maybe claws have been getting down in their bunkers one of the big ones the kind with stalks got into an ivan bunker last week eric said it got a whole platoon of them before they got their lid shut how do you know a buddy told me the thing came back with with remains moon base sir the communications officer said on the screen the face of the lunar monitor appeared his crisp uniform contrasted to the uniforms in the bunker and he was clean shaven moon base this is forward command l whistle on terra let me have general thompson the monitor faded presently general thompson s heavy features came into focus what is it major our claws got a single russian runner with a message we don t know whether to act on it there have been tricks like this in the past what s the message the russians want us to send a single officer on policy level over to their lines for a conference they don t state the nature of the conference they say that matters of he consulted the slip matters of grave urgency make it advisable that discussion be opened between a representative of the un forces and themselves he held the message up to the screen for the general to scan thompson s eyes moved what should we do hendricks said send a man out you don t think it s a trap it might be but the location they give for their forward command is correct it s worth a try at any rate i ll send an officer out and report the results to you as soon as he returns all right major thompson broke the connection the screen died up above the antenna came slowly down hendricks rolled up the paper deep in thought i ll go leone said they want somebody at policy level hendricks rubbed his jaw policy level i haven t been outside in months maybe i could use a little air don t you think it s risky hendricks lifted the view sight and gazed into it the remains of the russian were gone only a single claw was in sight it was folding itself back disappearing into the ash like a crab like some hideous metal crab that s the only thing that bothers me hendricks rubbed his wrist i know i m safe as long as i have this on me but there s something about them i hate the damn things i wish we d never invented them there s something wrong with them relentless little if we hadn t invented them the ivans would have hendricks pushed the sight back anyhow it seems to be winning the war i guess that s good sounds like you re getting the same jitters as the ivans hendricks examined his wrist watch i guess i had better get started if i want to be there before dark he took a deep breath and then stepped out onto the gray rubbled ground after a minute he lit a cigarette and stood gazing around him the landscape was dead nothing stirred he could see for miles endless ash and slag ruins of buildings a few trees without leaves or branches only the trunks above him the eternal rolling clouds of gray drifting between terra and the sun major hendricks went on off to the right something scuttled something round and metallic a claw going lickety split after something probably after a small animal a rat they got rats too as a sort of sideline he came to the top of the little hill and lifted his fieldglasses the russian lines were a few miles ahead of him they had a forward command post there the runner had come from it a squat robot with undulating arms passed by him its arms weaving inquiringly the robot went on its way disappearing under some debris hendricks watched it go he had never seen that type before there were getting to be more and more types he had never seen new varieties and sizes coming up from the underground factories hendricks put out his cigarette and hurried on it was interesting the use of artificial forms in warfare how had they got started necessity the soviet union had gained great initial success usual with the side that got the war going most of north america had been blasted off the map retaliation was quick in coming of course the sky was full of circling disc bombers long before the war began they had been up there for years the discs began sailing down all over russia within hours after washington got it but that hadn t helped washington the american bloc governments moved to the moon base the first year there was not much else to do europe was gone a slag heap with dark weeds growing from the ashes and bones most of north america was useless nothing could be planted no one could live a few million people kept going up in canada and down in south america but during the second year soviet parachutists began to drop a few at first then more and more they wore the first really effective anti radiation equipment what was left of american production moved to the moon along with the governments all but the troops the

4,2005,Twilight,5,i didn t see him leap me it was much too fast i only found myself suddenly airborne and then we crashed onto the sofa knocking it into the wall all the while his arms formed an iron cage of protection around me i was barely jostled but i still was gasping as i tried to right myself he wasn t having that he curled me into a ball against his chest holding me more securely than iron chains i glared at him in alarm but he seemed well in control his jaw relaxed as he grinned his eyes bright only with humor

6,2005,never let me go,5,that was the only time as i stood there looking at that strange rubbish feeling the wind coming across those empty fields that i started to imagine just a little fantasy thing because this was norfolk after all and it was only a couple of weeks since i d lost him i was thinking about the rubbish the flapping plastic in the branches the shore line of odd stuff caught along the fencing and i half closed my eyes and imagined this was the spot where everything i d ever lost since my childhood had washed up and i was now standing here in front of it and if i waited long enough a tiny figure would appear on the horizon across the field and gradually get larger until i d see it was tommy and he d wave maybe even call the fantasy never got beyond that i didn t let it and though the tears rolled down my face i wasn t sobbing or out of control i just waited a bit then turned back to the car to drive off to wherever it was i was supposed to be

13,2004,cloud atlas,5,belief like fear or love is a force to be understood as we understand the theory of relativity and principals of uncertainty phenomena that determine the course of our lives yesterday my life was headed in one direction today it is headed in another yesterday i believe i would never have done what i did today these forces that often remake time and space that can shape and alter who we imagine ourselves to be begin long before we are born and continue after we perish our lives and our choices like quantum trajectories are understood moment to moment that each point of intersection each encounter suggest a new potential direction proposition i have fallen in love with luisa rey is this possible i just met her and yet i feel like something important has happened to me
14,2006,the god delision,5,let us remind ourselves of the terminology a theist believes in a supernatural intelligence who in addition to his main work of creating the universe in the first place is still around to oversee and influence the subsequent fate of his initial creation in many theistic belief systems the deity is intimately involved in human affairs he answers prayers forgives or punishes sins intervenes in the world by performing miracles frets about good and bad deeds and knows when we do them or even think about doing them a deist too believes in a supernatural intelligence but one whose activities were confined to setting up the laws that govern the universe in the first place the deist god never intervenes thereafter and certainly has no specific interest in human affairs pantheists don t believe in a supernatural god at all but use the word god as a non supernatural synonym for nature or for the universe or for the lawfulness that governs its workings deists differ from theists in that their god does not answer prayers is not interested in sins or confessions does not read our thoughts and does not intervene with capricious miracles deists differ from pantheists in that the deist god is some kind of cosmic intelligence rather than the pantheist s metaphoric or poetic synonym for the laws of the universe pantheism is sexed up atheism deism is watered down theism

37,1982,different seasons,5,he most important things are the hardest to say they are the things you get ashamed of because words diminish them words shrink things that seemed limitless when they were in your head to no more than living size when they re brought out but it s more than that isn t it the most important things lie too close to wherever your secret heart is buried like landmarks to a treasure your enemies would love to steal away and you may make revelations that cost you dearly only to have people look at you in a funny way not understanding what you ve said at all or why you thought it was so important that you almost cried while you were saying it that s the worst i think when the secret stays locked within not for want of a teller but for want of an understanding ear

48,1989,the remains of the dead,5,ut what is the sense in forever speculating what might have happened had such and such a moment turned out differently one could presumably drive oneself to distraction in this way in any case while it is all very well to talk of turning points one can surely only recognize such moments in retrospect naturally when one looks back to such instances today they may indeed take the appearance of being crucial precious moments in one s life but of course at the time this was not the impression one had rather it was as though one had available a never ending number of days months years in which to sort out the vagaries of one s relationship with miss kenton an infinite number of further opportunities in which to remedy the effect of this or that misunderstanding there was surely nothing to indicate at the time that such evidently small incidents would render whole dreams forever irredeemable

year they set off early in september with never a thought that any danger might menace their dear ones after so many years of peace and comparative prosperity the children had work in plenty to keep them from idleness during the week of ten days their fathers might be absent and no sooner had the little vessel sailed out of the harbor than they set about their several tasks in order that all the labor might be performed by the time the fishermen returned mark and luke were engaged in setting up the flakes or framework on which the fish were to be dried and this labor was performed near the shore of the harbor quite beyond sight of the homesteads with the high palisade which last hid from view all save the roofs of the buildings the future hopes which was the name of the small vessel belonging to the settlers had left her moorings when the first gray light of the coming day could be seen stealing over the waters and while she was yet close in shore the two lads set about building the flakes counting on completing the task within three days and to that end working so industriously as to give little or no heed to what might be passing around them therefore it was that they failed to see a canoe in which were five indians come swiftly up from the southward past what is now known as pulpit rock and sail straight for the island at the mouth of the harbor which the people of to day call bar island here the frail craft was hidden from view of the boys and when half an hour or more had gone by another canoe this one carrying six men executed the same maneuver five minutes later a third craft appeared but just as she came in view past the rock luke stood erect to drive in one of the stakes and therefore saw the strangers as they were evidently trying to steal by without being seen more than once since luke could remember had mount desert been visited by red men of the abenakis tribe but the visitors had always approached boldly like friends and this skulking from rock to island seemed much like a show of enmity certain it is that the lad was alarmed but he understood from what his father had said many times that it was not wise to let the indians know of his fear and continuing at the labor he said in a low tone to mark don t raise your head nor look around a canoe filled with abenakis has sneaked in behind the harbor island can it be mischief is intended they may be after rock cod and count on coming ashore later mark replied continuing his work in such a fashion that he could look seaward without seeming to do so at this moment the occupants of the last canoe were moving around the point of the island as if to gain a position where a full view of the buildings might be had for there could be no possibility the visitors were engaged in fishing of any other such peaceful pursuit there s trouble of some kind and it s for us to find out what mark said in a whisper there must have been other canoes than the one you saw for i have already counted eleven men on the island and they could not all have come in a single boat the boys had had no experience fortunately for them in indian warfare but they had heard enough from their parents to be fully alive to the possibilities and after a few moments during which time fear had held them speechless mark said in a low tone although there was no chance the enemy could have heard him we must get over to the house without seeming to be running away you start first and when you go through the gate call out that mother wants to see me luke obeyed leisurely although his heart was beating so loudly and heavily that it seemed as if it could be heard a long distance away and arriving at the palisade he summoned his brother as had been proposed then it was that mark was at liberty to leave his work and he answered the summons more quickly perhaps than ever before in his life mistress pemberton was busily engaged inside the house and the other two children were in a small garden directly in the rear of the building therefore the boys were able to impart the disagreeable tidings without alarming those who could be of little or no assistance indians skulking on the harbor island the good woman exclaimed when mark had hurriedly told his story and her face paled as the lads had never seen it before and they have chanced to come on the very day our father went fishing luke cried it wasn t chance that brought them my son unless coming for some evil purpose they would have landed boldly as they have done so many times it must be that the painted wretches have been watching to learn when your father and uncle left the island ask your aunt and susan to come over her the other children need not be told until it is no longer possible to hold them in ignorance of what may be done luke ran swiftly to the house which stood hardly more than fifty feet away and in a twinkling mistress harding and her daughter susan were where they could hear what to settlers in their situation was the worst possible news illustration indians skulking on the harbor island women who did their share in conquering the wilderness were not cowardly even though they might turn pale with apprehension when the first note of danger was sounded and there two knowing it was useless to expect aid from the outside lost no time in planning a defence the palisade was weak in many places more than one of the timbers had decayed and fallen for while the indians from the near by mainland were friendly disposed there seemed to be no good reason why time and labor should be expended upon a means of defence which might never be needed and at this moment both the women bethought themselves of such fact there may be time in which to strengthen the fence mistress har

course of weeks an unexpectedly small appointment to go to hanover under truchsess von waldburg and announce our accession which is but a simple mostly formal service yet perhaps what bielfeld is best

manners along with which something of substantial may be privately conjoined for example if he had in secret his eye on julich and berg could anything be fitter than to ascertain what the french will think of such an enterprise what the french and next to them what the english that is to say hanoverians who meddle much in affairs of the reich for these reasons and others he likewise probably with more study than in the bielfeld case despatches colonel camas to make his compliment at the french court and in an expert way take soundings there camas a fat sedate military gentleman of advanced years full of observation experience and sound sense with one arm which he makes do the work of two and nobody can notice that the other arm resting in his coat breast is of cork so expert is he will do in this matter what is feasible probably not much for the present he is to call on voltaire as he passes who is in holland again at the hague for some months back and deliver him a little cask of hungary wine which probably his majesty had thought exquisite of which and the other insignificant passages between them we hear more than enough in the writings and correspondences of voltaire about

mere hope and exuberance as yet and may even be made worse than nothing according to the knights he shall manage to have happily it proved a successful new order in this last all essential particular

daily life is only too likely to have the most unfortunate results on those who are subjected to it and as a matter of fact we find that the well to do catholics of pope s day lived in an atmosphere of disaffection political intrigue and evasion of the law most unfavorable for the development of that frank courageous and patriotic spirit for the lack of which pope himself has so often been made the object of reproach in a well known passage of the epistle to arbuthnot pope has spoken of his life as one long disease he was in fact a humpbacked dwarf not over four feet six inches in height with long spider like legs and arms he was subject to violent headaches and his face was lined and contracted with the marks of suffering in youth he so completely ruined his health by perpetual studies that his life was despaired of and only the most careful treatment saved him from an early death toward the close of his life he became so weak that he could neither dress nor undress without assistance he had to be laced up in stiff stays in order to sit erect and wore a fur doublet and three pairs of stockings to protect himself against the cold with these physical defects he had the extreme sensitiveness of mind that usually accompanies chronic ill health and this sensitiveness was outraged incessantly by the brutal customs of the age pope s enemies made as free with his person as with his poetry and there is little doubt that he felt the former attacks the more bitterly of the two dennis his first critic called him a short squab gentleman the very bow of the god of love his outward form is downright monkey a rival poet whom he had offended hung up a rod in a coffee house where men of letters resorted and threatened to whip pope like a naughty child if he showed his face there it is said though perhaps not on the best authority that when pope once forgot himself so far as to make love to lady mary wortley montague the lady s answer was a fit of immoderate laughter in an appendix to the dunciad pope collected some of the epithets with which his enemies had pelted him an ape an ass a frog a coward a fool a little abject thing he affected indeed to despise his assailants but there is only too good evidence that their poisoned arrows rankled in his heart richardson the painter found him one day reading the latest abusive pamphlet these things are my diversion said the poet striving to put the best face on it but as he read his friends saw his features writhen with anguish and prayed to be delivered from all such diversions as these pope s enemies and their savage abuse are mostly forgotten to day pope s furious retorts have been secured to immortality by his genius it would have been nobler no doubt to have answered by silence only but before one condemns pope it is only fair to realize the causes of his bitterness pope s education was short and irregular he was taught the rudiments of latin and greek by his family priest attended for a brief period a school in the country and another in london and at the early age of twelve left school altogether and settling down at his father s house in the country began to read to his heart s delight he roamed through the classic poets translating passages that pleased him went up for a time to london to get lessons in french and italian and above all read with eagerness and attention the works of older english poets spenser waller and dryden he had already it would seem determined to become a poet and his father delighted with the clever boy s talent used to set him topics force him to correct his verses over and over and finally when satisfied dismiss him with the praise these are good rhymes he wrote a comedy a tragedy an epic poem all of which he afterward destroyed and as he laughingly confessed in later years he thought himself the greatest genius that ever was pope was not alone however in holding a high opinion of his talents while still a boy in his teens he was taken up and patronized by a number of gentlemen trumbull walsh and cromwell all dabblers in poetry and criticism he was introduced to the dramatist wycherly nearly fifty years his senior and helped to polish some of the old man s verses his own works were passed about in manuscript from hand to hand till one of them came to the eyes of dryden s old publisher tonson tonson wrote pope a respectful letter asking for the honor of being allowed to publish them one may fancy the delight with which the sixteen year old boy received this offer it is a proof of pope s patience as well as his precocity that he delayed three years before accepting it it was not till that his first published verses the pastorals a fragment translated from homer and a modernized version of one of the canterbury tales appeared in tonson s miscellany with the publication of the pastorals pope embarked upon his life as a man of letters they seem to have brought him a certain recognition but hardly fame that he obtained by his next poem the essay on criticism which appeared in it was applauded in the spectator and pope seems about this time to have made the acquaintance of addis

martial music and the echoes of its mountains threw back the laugh or repeated the wanton cry of many a gallant and reckless youth as he hurried by them in the noontide of his spirits to slumber in a long night of forgetfulness it was in this scene of strife and bloodshed that the incidents we shall attempt to relate occurred during the third year of the war which england and france last waged for the possession of a country that neither was destined to retain the imbecility of her military leaders abroad and the fatal want of energy in her councils at home had lowered the character of great britain from the proud elevation on which it had been placed by the talents and enterprise of her former warriors and statesmen no longer dreaded by her enemies her servants were fast losing the confidence of self respect in this mortifying abasement the colonists though innocent of her imbecility and too humble to be the agents of her blunders were but the natural participators they had recently seen a chosen army from that country which reverencing as a mother they had blindly believed invincible an army led by a chief who had been selected from a crowd of trained warriors for his rare military endowments disgracefully routed by a handful of french and indians and only saved from annihilation by the coolness and spirit of a virginian boy whose riper fame has since diffused itself with the steady influence of moral truth to the uttermost confines of christendom a wide frontier had been laid naked by this unexpected disaster and more substantial evils were preceded by a thousand fanciful and imaginary dangers the alarmed colonists believed that the yells of the savages mingled with every fitful gust of wind that issued from the interminable forests of the west the terrific character of their merciless enemies increased immeasurably the natural horrors of warfare numberless recent massacres were still vivid in their recollections nor was there any ear in the provinces so deaf as not to have drunk in with avidity the narrative of some fearful tale of midnight murder in which the natives of the forests were the principal and barbarous actors as the credulous and excited traveller related the hazardous chances of the wilderness the blood of the timid curdled with terror and mothers cast anxious glances even at those children which slumbered within the security of the largest towns in short the magnifying influence of fear began to set at naught the calculations of reason and to render those who should have remembered their manhood the slaves of the basest of passions even the most confident and the stoutest hearts began to think the issue of the contest was becoming doubtful and that abject class was hourly increasing in numbers who thought they foresaw all the possessions of the english crown in america subdued by their christian foes or laid waste by the inroads of their relentless allies when therefore intelligence was received at the fort which covered the southern termination of the portage between the hudson and the lakes that montcalm had been seen moving up the champlain with an army numerous as the leaves on the trees its truth was admitted with more of the craven reluctance of fear than with the stern joy that a warrior should feel in finding an enemy within reach of his blow the news had been brought towards the decline of a day in midsummer by an indian runner who also bore an urgent request from munro the commander of a work on the shore of the holy lake for a speedy and powerful reinforcement it has already been mentioned that the distance between these two posts was less than five leagues the rude path which originally formed their line of communication had been widened for the passage of wagons so that the distance which had been travelled by the son of the forest in two hours might easily be effected by a detachment of troops with their necessary baggage between the rising and setting of a summer sun the loyal servants of the british crown had given to one of these forest fastnesses the name of william henry and to the other that of fort edward calling each after a favorite prince of the reigning family the veteran scotchman just named held the first with a regiment of regulars and a few provincials a force really by far too small to make head against the formidable power that montcalm was leading to the foot of his earthen mounds at the latter however lay general webb who commanded the armies of the king in the northern provinces with a body of more than five thousand men by uniting the several detachments of his command this officer might have arrayed nearly double that number of combatants against the enterprising frenchman who had ventured so far from his reinforcements with an army but little superior in numbers but under the influence of their degraded fortunes both officers and men appeared better disposed to await the approach of their formidable antagonists within their works than to resist the progress of their march by emulating the successful example of the french at fort du quesne and striking a blow on their advance after the first surprise of the intelligence had a little abated a rumor was spread through the entrenched camp which stretched along the margin of the hudson forming a chain of outworks to the body of the fort itself that a chosen detachment of fifteen hundred men was to depart with the dawn for william henry the post at the northern extremity of the portage that which at first was only rumor soon became certainty as orders passed from the quarters of the commander in chief to the several corps he had selected for this service to prepare for their speedy departure all doubt as to the intention of webb

consideration and necessary to convey to you that information of the state of the union which it is my duty to afford the welfare of our country is the great object to which our cares and efforts ought to be directed and i shall derive great satisfaction from a cooperation with you in the pleasing though arduous task of insuring to our fellow citizens the blessings which they have a right to expect from a free efficient and equal government state of the union address george washington december fellow citizens of the senate and house of representatives in meeting you again i feel much satisfaction in being able to repeat my congratulations on the favorable prospects which continue to distinguish our public affairs the abundant fruits of another year have blessed our country with plenty and with the means of a flourishing commerce the progress of public credit is witnessed by a considerable rise of american stock abroad as well as at home and the revenues allotted for this and other national purposes have been productive beyond the calculations by which they were regulated this latter circumstance is the more pleasing as it is not only a proof of the fertility of our resources but as it assures us of a further increase of the national respectability and credit and let me add as it bears an honorable testimony to the patriotism and integrity of the mercantile and marine part of our citizens the punctuality of the former in discharging their engagements has been exemplary in conformity to the powers vested in me by acts of the last session a loan of florins toward which some provisional measures had previously taken place has been completed in holland as well the celerity with which it has been filled as the nature of the terms considering the more than ordinary demand for borrowing created by the situation of europe give a reasonable hope that the further execution of those powers may proceed with advantage and success the secretary of the treasury has my directions to communicate such further particulars as may be requisite for more precise information since your last sessions i have received communications by which it appears that the district of kentucky at present a part of virginia has concurred in certain propositions contained in a law of that state in consequence of which the district is to become a distinct member of the union in case the requisite sanction of congress be added for this sanction application is now made i shall cause the papers on this very transaction to be laid before you the liberality and harmony with which it has been conducted will be found to do great honor to both the parties and the sentiments of warm attachment to the union and its present government expressed by our fellow citizens of kentucky can not fail to add an affectionate concern for their particular welfare to the great national impressions under which you will decide on the case submitted to you it has been heretofore known to congress that frequent incursions have been made on our frontier settlements by certain banditti of indians from the northwest side of the ohio these with some of the tribes dwelling on and near the wabash have of late been particularly active in their depredations and being emboldened by the impunity of their crimes and aided by such parts of the neighboring tribes as could be seduced to join in their hostilities or afford them a retreat for their prisoners and plunder they have instead of listening to the humane invitations and overtures made on the part of the united states renewed their violences with fresh alacrity and greater effect the lives of a number of valuable citizens have thus been sacrificed and some of them under circumstances peculiarly shocking whilst others have been carried into a deplorable captivity these aggravated provocations rendered it essential to the safety of the western settlements that the aggressors should be made sensible that the government of the union is not less capable of punishing their crimes than it is disposed to respect their rights and reward their attachments as this object could not be effected by defensive measures it became necessary to put in force the act which empowers the president to call out the militia for the protection of the frontiers and i have accordingly authorized an expedition in which the regular troops in that quarter are combined with such drafts of militia as were deemed sufficient the event of the measure is yet unknown to me the secretary of war is directed to lay before you a statement of the information on which it is founded as well as an estimate of the expense with which it will be attended the disturbed situation of europe and particularly the critical posture of the great maritime powers whilst it ought to make us the more thankful for the general peace and security enjoyed by the united states reminds us at the same time of the circumspection with which it becomes us to preserve these blessings it requires also that we should not overlook the tendency of a war and even of preparations for a war among the nations most concerned in active commerce with this country to abridge the means and thereby at least enhance the price of transporting its valuable productions to their markets i recommend it to your serious reflections how far and in what mode it may be expedient to guard against embarrassments from these contingencies by such encouragements to our own navigation as will render our commerce and agriculture less dependent on foreign bottoms which may

had to the full the independence the initiative which her woman was without or rather was without when acting for herself for when acting in the interests of her mistress amy was a different creature like all of defoe s principal characters roxana is eminently practical cold blooded and selfish after the first pang at parting with her five children she seldom thinks of them except as encumbrances she will provide for them as decently as she can without personal inconvenience but even a slight sacrifice for the sake of one of them is too much for her towards all the men with whom she has dealings and towards the friendly quakeress of the minories too she shows a calculating reticence which is most unfeminine the continuator of our story endowed the heroine with wholly characteristic selfishness when he made her on hearing of amy s death feel less sorrow for the miserable fate of her friend than for her own loss of an adviser and yet roxana is capable of fine feeling as is proved by those tears of joy for the happy change in her fortunes which bring about that realistic love scene between her and the prince in regard to the supposed paint on her cheeks again when shipwreck threatens her and amy her emotion and repentance are due as much to the thought that she has degraded amy to her own level as to thoughts of her more flagrant sins that she is capable of feeling gratitude she shows in her generosity to the quakeress and in her rage and remorse on suspecting that her daughter has been murdered and in her emotion several times on seeing her children roxana shows herself a true woman in short though for the most part monumentally selfish she is yet saved from being impossible by several displays of noble emotion one of the surprises to a student of defoe is that this thick skinned mercantile writer the vulgarest of all our great men of letters in the early eighteenth century seems to have known a woman s heart better than a man s at least he has succeeded in making two or three of his women characters more alive than any of his men it is another surprise that in writing of women defoe often seems ahead of his age in the argument between roxana and her dutch merchant about a woman s independence roxana talks like a character in a problem play or novel of our own day this perhaps is not to defoe s credit but it is to his credit that he has said elsewhere a woman well bred and well taught furnished with the accomplishments of knowledge and behaviour is a creature without comparison her society is the emblem of sublime enjoyments and the man that has such a one to his portion has nothing to do but to rejoice in her and be thankful after reading these words one cannot but regret that defoe did not try to create heroines more virtuous than moll flanders and roxana it is not only in drawing his characters that defoe in the fortunate mistress comes nearer than usual to producing a novel this narrative of his is less loosely constructed than any others except robinson crusoe and the journal of the plague year which it was easier to give structure to in both of them the story of a solitary on a desert island and the story of the visitation of a pestilence the nature of the subject made the author s course tolerably plain in the fortunate mistress the proper course was by no means so well marked the more credit is due defoe therefore that the book is so far from being entirely inorganised that had he taken sufficient pains with the ending it would have had as much structure as many good novels there is no strongly defined plot it is true but in general if a character is introduced he is heard from again a scene that impresses itself on the mind of the heroine is likely to be important in the sequel the story seems to be working itself out to a logical conclusion when unexpectedly it comes to an end defoe apparently grew tired of it for some reason and wound it up abruptly with only the meagre information as to the fate of roxana and amy that they fell into a dreadful course of calamities g h maynadier footnotes see memoirs of a cavalier an essay upon projects an academy for women author s preface the history of this beautiful lady is to speak for itself if it is not as beautiful as the lady herself is reported to be if it is not as diverting as the reader can desire and much more than he can reasonably expect and if all the most diverting parts of it are not adapted to the instruction and improvement of the reader the relator says it must be from the defect of his performance dressing up the story in worse clothes than the lady whose words he speaks prepared for the world he takes the liberty to say that this story differs from most of the modern performances of this kind though some of them have met with a very good reception in the world i say it differs from them in this great and essential article namely that the foundation of this is laid in truth of fact and so the work is not a story but a history the scene is laid so near the place where the main part of it was transacted that it was necessary to conceal names and persons lest what cannot be yet entirely forgot in that part of the town should be remembered and the facts traced back too plainly by the many people yet living who would know the persons by the particulars it is not always necessary that the names of persons should be discovered though the history may be many ways useful and if we should be always obliged to name the persons or not to relate the story the consequence might be only this that many a pleasant and delightful history would be buried in the dark and the world deprived both of the pleasure and the profit of it the writer says he was particularly acquainted with this lad

to lay before us such prospects of national advantages and such views of prosperity as would be sufficient to prevail with those who have their eyes upon the good of their country and of their posterity after them that then a case so popular and of so much consequence as this is may not want such due supports as the nature of the thing will allow and especially since the advantages and good consequences of the thing itself are so many and so easy to be seen as his friends allege why should not the good people of britain be made easy and their fears be turned into peaceable satisfaction by seeing that this devil may not be so black as he is painted and that the noise made of the pretender and the frightful things said of his coming and of his being received here may not be made greater scarecrows to us than they really are and after all that has been said if it should appear that the advantages of the pretender s succession are really greater to us and the dangers less to us than those of the succession of hanover then much of their difficulties would be over who standing neuter as to persons appear against the pretender only because they are made to believe strange and terrible things of what shall befall the nation in case of his coming in such as popery slavery french power destroying of our credit and devouring our funds as that scandalous scribbler the review has been labouring to suggest with many other things which we shall endeavour to expose to you as they deserve if we say it should appear then that the dangers and disadvantages of the pretender s succession are less than those of the house of hanover who because of an act of parliament you know must not be called pretenders then there will remain nothing more to be said on that score but the debate must be of the reasonableness and justice on either side for their admittance and there we question not but the side we are really pleading for will have the advantage to begin then with that most popular and affrighting argument now made use of as the bugbear of the people against several other things besides jacobitism we mean french greatness it is most evident that the fear of this must by the nature of the thing be effectually removed upon our receiving the pretender the grounds and reasons why french greatness is rendered formidable to us and so much weight supposed to be in it that like the name of scanderberg we fright our very children with it lie only in this that we suggest the king of france being a professed enemy to the peace and the liberty of great britain will most certainly as soon as he can a little recover himself exercise all that formidable power to put the pretender upon us and not only to place him upon the throne of great britain but to maintain and hold him up in it against all the opposition either of the people of britain or the confederate princes leagued with the elector of hanover who are in the interest of his claim or of his party now it is evident that upon a peaceable admitting this person whom they call the pretender to receive and enjoy the crown here all that formidable power becomes your friend and the being so must necessarily take off from it everything that is called terrible forasmuch as the greater terror and amusement the power we apprehend really carries with it the greater is the tranquillity and satisfaction which accrues to us when we have the friendship of that power which was so formidable to us before the power of france is represented at this time very terrible and the writers who speak of it apply it warm to our imaginations as that from whence we ought justly to apprehend the impossibility of keeping out the pretender and this notwithstanding they allow themselves at the same time to suppose all the confederate powers of europe to be engaged as well by their own interest as by the new treaties of barrier and guarantee to support and to assist the claim of the elector of hanover and his party now if this power be so great and so formidable as they allege will it not on the other side add a proportion of increase to our satisfaction that this power will be wholly in friendship and league with us and engaged to concern itself for the quieting our fears of other foreign invaders forasmuch as having once concerned itself to set the person of the pretender upon the throne it cannot be supposed but it shall be equally concerned to support and maintain him in that possession as what will mightily conduce to the carrying on the other projects of his greatness and glory with the rest of europe in which it will be very much his interest to secure himself from any opposition he might meet with from this nation or from such as might be rendered powerful by our assistance an eminent instance we have of this in the mighty efforts the french nation have made for planting and preserving when planted a grandson of france upon the throne of spain and how eminent are the advantages to france from the success of that undertaking of what less consequence then would it be to the august monarchy of france to secure and engage to himself the constant friendship and assistance of the power of great britain which he would necessarily do by the placing this person upon the throne who would thereby in gratitude be engaged to contribute his utmost in return to the king of france for the carrying on his glorious designs in the rest of europe while then we become thus necessary to the king of france reason dictates that he would be our fast friend our constant confederate our ally firmly engaged to secure our sovereign and protect our people from the insults and attempts of all the world being thus engaged reciprocally with the king of france there must necessarily be an end of all the fears and jealousies

generally chosen because in that situation the essential passions of the heart find a better soil in which they can attain their maturity are less under restraint and speak a plainer and more emphatic language because in that situation our elementary feelings exist in a state of greater simplicity and consequently may be more accurately contemplated and more forcibly communicated because the manners of rural life germinate from those elementary feelings and from the necessary character of rural occupations are more easily comprehended and are more durable and lastly because in that situation the passions of men are incorporated with the beautiful and permanent forms of nature the language too of these men is adopted purified indeed from what appear to be its real defects from all lasting and rational causes of dislike or disgust because such men hourly communicate with the best objects from which the best part of language is originally derived and because from their rank in society and the sameness and narrow circle of their intercourse being less under the action of social vanity they convey their feelings and notions in simple and unelaborated expressions accordingly such a language arising out of repeated experience and regular feelings is a more permanent and a far more philosophical language than that which is frequently substituted for it by poets who think that they are conferring honour upon themselves and their art in proportion as they separate themselves from the sympathies of men and indulge in arbitrary and capricious habits of expression in order to furnish food for fickle tastes and fickle appetites of their own creation footnote it is worth while here to observe that the affecting parts of chaucer are almost always expressed in language pure and universally intelligible even to this day i cannot be insensible of the present outcry against the triviality and meanness both of thought and language which some of my contemporaries have occasionally introduced into their metrical compositions and i acknowledge that this defect where it exists is more dishonorable to the writer s own character than false refinement or arbitrary innovation though i should contend at the same time that it is far less pernicious in the sum of its consequences from such verses the poems in these volumes will be found distinguished at least by one mark of difference that each of them has a worthy purpose not that i mean to say that i always began to write with a distinct purpose formally conceived but i believe that my habits of meditation have so formed my feelings as that my descriptions of such objects as strongly excite those feelings will be found to carry along with them a purpose if in this opinion i am mistaken i can have little right to the name of a poet for all good poetry is the spontaneous overflow of powerful feelings but though this be true poems to which any value can be attached were never produced on any variety of subjects but by a man who being possessed of more than usual organic sensibility had also thought long and deeply for our continued influxes of feeling are modified and directed by our thoughts which are indeed the representatives of all our past feelings and as by contemplating the relation of these general representatives to each other we discover what is really important to men so by the repetition and continuance of this act feelings connected with important subjects will be nourished till at length if we be originally possessed of much organic sensibility such habits of mind will be produced that by obeying blindly and mechanically the impulses of those habits we shall describe objects and utter sentiments of such a nature and in such connection with each other that the understanding of the being to whom we address ourselves if he be in a healthful state of association must necessarily be in some degree enlightened his taste exalted and his affections ameliorated i have said that each of these poems has a purpose i have also informed my reader what this purpose will be found principally to be namely to illustrate the manner in which our feelings and ideas are associated in a state of excitement but speaking in less general language it is to follow the fluxes and refluxes of the mind when agitated by the great and simple affections of our nature this object i have endeavoured in these short essays to attain by various means by tracing the maternal passion through many of its more subtle windings as in the poems of the idiot boy and the mad mother by accompanying the last struggles of a human being at the approach of death cleaving in solitude to life and society as in the poem of the forsaken indian by shewing as in the stanzas entitled we are seven the perplexity and obscurity which in childhood attend our notion of death or rather our utter inability to admit that notion or by displaying the strength of fraternal or to speak more philosophically of moral attachment when early associated with the great and beautiful objects of nature as in the brothers or as in the incident of simon lee by placing my reader in the way of receiving from ordinary moral sensations another and more salutary impression than we are accustomed to receive from them it has also been part of my general purpose to attempt to sketch characters under the influence of less impassioned feelings as in the old man travelling the two thieves c characters of which the elements are simple belonging rather to nature than to manners such as exist now and will probably always exist and which from their constitution may be distinctly and profitably contemplated i will not abuse the indulgence of my reader by dwelling longer upon this subject but it is proper that i should mention one other circumstance which distinguis

engage in religious controversy and the furious contest civil and ecclesiastical which ensued on the accession of queen anne gave him an opportunity of gratifying his favourite passion he therefore published a tract entitled the shortest way with the dissenters or proposals for the establishment of the church which contained an ironical recommendation of persecution but written in so serious a strain that many persons particularly dissenters at first mistook its real intention the high church party however saw and felt the ridicule and by their influence a prosecution was commenced against him and a proclamation published in the gazette offering a reward for his apprehension when de foe found with how much rigour himself and his pamphlet were about to be treated he at first secreted himself but his printer and bookseller being taken into custody he surrendered being resolved as he expresses it to throw himself upon the favour of government rather than that others should be ruined for his mistakes in july he was brought to trial found guilty and sentenced to be imprisoned to stand in the pillory and to pay a fine of two hundred marks he underwent the infamous part of the punishment with great fortitude and it seems to have been generally thought that he was treated with unreasonable severity so far was he from being ashamed of his fate himself that he wrote a hymn to

uses represented his unmerited sufferings to the queen and at length procured his release the treasurer lord godolphin also sent a considerable sum to his wife and family and to him money to pay his fine and the expense of his discharge gratitude and fidelity are inseparable from an honest man and it was this benevolent act that prompted de foe to support harley with his able and ingenious pen when anne lay lifeless and his benefactor in the vicissitude of party was persecuted by faction and overpowered though not conquered by violence the talents and perseverance of de foe began now to be properly estimated and as a firm supporter of the administration he was sent by lord godolphin to scotland on an errand which as he says was far from being unfit for a sovereign to direct or an honest man to perform his knowledge of commerce and revenue his powers of insinuation and above all his readiness of pen were deemed of no small utility in promoting the union of the two kingdoms of which he wrote an able history in with two dedications one to the queen and another to the duke of queensbury soon afterwards he unhappily by some equivocal writings rendered himself suspected by both parties so that he once more retired to newington in hopes of spending the remainder of his days in peace his pension being withdrawn and wearied with politics he began to compose works of a different kind the year may therefore be regarded as the period of de foe s political life faction henceforth found other advocates and parties procured other writers to disseminate their suggestions and to propagate their falsehoods in de foe published the family instructor a work inculcating the domestic duties in a lively manner by narration and dialogue and displaying much knowledge of life in the

peers whose poverty made them dependent on governmental subsidies but this number would not have given harley even a bare majority in the strongly whig house of lords and there harley needed at least enough strength to ensure success for some of the measures designed to satisfy the demands of the newly tory house of commons particularly if his ministry was to be able to negotiate a satisfactory treaty of peace with france to obtain a tory majority in the house of lords commensurate with the one in commons harley could have seen to the creation of a sufficient number of new peerages but this would have alienated too many factions and the recently completed union with scotland offered what appeared to be a far simpler expedient the act of union provided for the election of sixteen scottish peers who would represent all of the scottish nobility in the house of lords if he could ensure that all sixteen of these peers were tory harley would be certain of a large block of loyal votes in the upper house or at worst he would have to arrange for the creation of only a few new peers to neutralize the whigs strength to john campbell the second duke of argyll harley assigned the task of orchestrating a tory sweep in this election the duke of argyll sat in the house of lords as the earl of greenwich an english title not as one of the elected peers and as such he was not elegible to stand as a candidate or to vote in this election argyll had supported the whig junto and held the rank of lieutenant general under marlborough in france but in seeing the direction the political tide was taking he abandoned his support of godolphin s ministry so that by the time the sacheverell trial was finished it was known that the great chief of the campbells and of the scottish whigs had gone into opposition to the government of godolphin in league with harley although he voted for the doctor s condemnation argyll and the sixteen representative peers if they were all tories together with the votes of those peers who were dependant upon government subsidies would give the new ministry of harley enough votes in the upper house for almost any eventuality even the impeachment of marlborough it is possible to speculate that this was the plum command of the british armies in europe that induced argyll s change from whig to tory in argyll s jealousy and resentment of his commander had been a well known bit of gossip for some time and it is very possible that argyll saw a new government as his chance to steal a march on marlborough although harley s ministry did give the order of the garter to argyll on december he was never promoted over marlborough but that was not due to any lack of success in assuring a tory victory in the election of the peers argyll s heavy handed management of that election is the subject of defoe s atalantis major by birth and education daniel defoe was a member of the mercantile middle class he was a dissenter and his political and

propagandist for the vigorous prosecution of the war with france after his five month imprisonment in for writing the shortest way with dissenters defoe was employed as an agent and pamphleteer of the government first in the service of robert harley godolphin s secretary of state during the early moderate years of the godolphin administration and thereafter working for godolphin himself defoe s review preached the gospel of national unity above party faction when harley replaced godolphin as treasurer in defoe returned to his service although it may appear from this that defoe s pen was for hire by whichever party was in power in point of fact defoe s political views were remarkably congruent with those of both harley and godolphin all three were staunch supporters of england s commercial interests the hanoverian succession liberty of conscience for dissenters and nonconformists and the terms of the revolution settlement it must be remembered that godolphin and harley were both moderates each trying to chart his course between the extremes of the parties they like daniel defoe saw their loyalty being to england and to the queen not to a party like defoe they both discovered that politics often make strange bedfellows godolphin faced with a large whig majority in the house of commons after the general election of found that his fortunes were bound to those of the junto harley after the general election of discovered the necessity of courting the high church tories far more than he would have liked argyll s slate of scottish peers for the november election included men who were even more extreme in their toryism than the majority of high church english tories most of the sixteen were high church many had strong catholic leanings all of them were against increasing the religious liberties of the scottish presbyterians and thus those of the english dissenters and nonconformists several of these peers had been openly professed jacobites and all were in some degree sympathetic to france to have men with such beliefs in parliament meant to defoe the chance that marlborough s victories in france would be negotiated away the loss of what the toleration

of twelve new peers harley s job of using diverse elements to form a moderate government became more complex he found it expedient to establish and maintain influence with groups ranging from the radical tory october club to swift s country squire and clergy examiner readers to moderate whigs such as shrewsbury moreover defoe had impressed upon him the importance of assuring the nation that moderate and sensible men were at the bottom of all of the political changes harley therefore prepared for at least three apparently exclusive possibilities prosecuting the war for several more years negotiating a peace with the allies or making a separate peace with france without the allies to keep all these possibilities alive harley had to remain in harmony with marlborough the general s popularity with the soldiers and the european powers and france s awe of his military prowess necessitated the appearance that marlborough s command was secure while the examiner with its tory audience and its emphasis on pressure for peace was essential to harley so were swift s and defoe s appeals for moderation at a time when sympathy for marlborough was rampant and the call no peace without spain was still defended even by the october club for the same reasons he was glad to have bolingbroke openly associated with the examiner january of brought the decisive defeat at brihuega which effectively took the issue of spanish succession away in the ensuing witch hunt almanza and the peace talks of were revived to distract the people while these inquiries proceeded england received word that france was ready to discuss terms the delay between this february and france s formal proposal may was an anxious time for harley and his schemers defoe was busy setting the stage for the outcome while swift the high tory could easily set about discrediting marlborough the hero and standard bearer and by so doing weaken the whig s position defoe s readers required different handling his most effective writing at this time was in pamphlets which reached a wider audience and which were not bound by the consistency of the review defoe and swift primed with the minister s inside knowledge set about to discredit the whig ministry in basically the same way in the february examiner swift wrote no body that i know of did ever dispute the duke of marlborough s courage conduct or success they have been always unquestionable and will continue to be so in spight of the malice of his enemies or which is yet more the weakness of his advocates the nation only wished to see him taken out of ill hands and put into better but what is all this to the conduct of the late ministry the shameful mismanagements in spain or the wrong steps in the treaty of peace defoe remarks our general wants neither conduct or courage and describes his greatest successes as daughters to preserve his memory while dissociating him somewhat from the jacobites whigs and business of making peace and war when the review finally discusses marlborough s fall defoe suggests that the greatest guilt is the error in policy and prudence among his friends both writers presented the duke as a means to an end and discredited him on personal grounds avarice ambition thereby protecting the military hero and the newborn glory of england fathered by his victories faced with dissenters and moderate whig readers defoe s review had to seem to oppose swift s examiner with its sneers at trade not only must it be consistent but it was obliged to shift its readers attention more slowly to the earlier failures of the whig ministry and the rich commercial advantages gained in the separate peace the life of marlborough is part of a stream of pamphlets which defoe wrote supporting the harley administration a supplement to the faults on both sides a discussion of the sacheverell case by two displac d officers of state rogues on both sides a study in contrasts between old and new whigs and old high flyer and new tories and a seasonable caution to the general assembly were published immediately before and after that same year his pamphlets discuss the october club the spanish succession mr harley and the state of religion by summer when the peace was nearly assured though still secret defoe was writing reasons for a peace or the war at an end taken in chronological order defoe s pamphlets indicate two emerging directions first the reasons for ending the war become more positive and entirely unconcerned with the general and second defoe s comments about the duke become less wholeheartedly admiring especially in no queen or no general rogues on both sides is witty praise for moderate men who act according to english principles of law and liberty regardless of people and party rather than believing any demagogue who cries it rains butter d turnips after this the pamphlets become more informative and solemn defoe demonstrates whigs and tories want the same things and that the country bleeds to death armageddon or the necessity of carrying on the war october reasons why this nation ought to put a speedy end to this expensive war october and reasons for a peace or the war at an end for example catalog the economic ailments taxes pirates hard to replace sailors and soldiers killed but far worse a decline in trade resulting in closed shops and declining manufacturing increasing unemployment the whole kingdom sold to usury and consumption of the growth of the country as the year passed defoe mentioned marlborough less and less but the general s

the king to consent to a bill for triennial parliaments when swift took up his residence at moor park he found there a little girl of eight daughter of a merchant named edward johnson who had died young swift says that esther johnson was born on march in the parish register of richmond which shows that she was baptized on march her name is given as hester but she signed her will esther the name by which she was always known swift says her father was a younger brother of a good family in nottinghamshire her mother of a lower degree and indeed she had little to boast in her birth mrs johnson had two children esther and ann and lived at moor park as companion to lady giffard temple s widowed sister another member of the household afterwards to be esther s constant companion was rebecca dingley a relative of the temple family she was a year or two older than swift the lonely young man of twenty two was both playfellow and teacher of the delicate child of eight how he taught her to write has been charmingly brought before us in the painting exhibited by miss dicksee at the royal academy a few years ago he advised her what books to read and instructed her as he says in the principles of honour and virtue from which she never swerved in any one action or moment of her life by swift had grown tired of his position and finding that temple who valued his services was slow in finding him preferment he left moor park in order to carry out his resolve to go into the church he was ordained and obtained the prebend of kilroot near belfast where he carried on a flirtation with a miss waring whom he called varina but in may temple made proposals which induced swift to return to moor park where he was employed in preparing temple s memoirs and correspondence for publication and in supporting the side taken by temple in the letters of phalaris controversy by writing the battle of the books which was however not published until on his return to temple s house swift found his old playmate grown from a sickly child into a girl of fifteen in perfect health she came he says to be looked upon as one of the most beautiful graceful and agreeable young women in london only a little too fat her hair was blacker than a raven and every feature of her face in perfection on his death in january temple left a will dated directing the payment of pounds each with half a year s wages to bridget johnson and all my other servants and leaving a lease of some land in monistown county wicklow to esther johnson servant to my sister giffard by a codicil of february temple left pounds to mr jonathan swift now living with me it may be added that by her will of proved in the following year lady giffard gave pounds to mrs moss mrs bridget johnson who had married

which i am told is there in my name upon the survivorship and for which she has constantly sent over her certificate and received the interest i give her besides my two little silver candlesticks temple left in swift s hands the task of publishing his posthumous works a duty which afterwards led to a quarrel with lady giffard and other members of the family many years later swift told lord palmerston that he stopped at moor park solely for the benefit of temple s conversation and advice and the opportunity of pursuing his studies at temple s death he was as far to seek as ever in the summer of however he was offered and accepted the post of secretary and chaplain to the earl of berkeley one of the lords justices but when he reached ireland he found that the secretaryship had been given to another he soon however obtained the living of laracor agher and rathbeggan and the prebend of dunlavin in st patrick s cathedral dublin the total value of these preferments was about pounds a year an income which miss waring seems to have thought enough to justify him in marrying swift s reply to the lady whom he had singled out at first from the rest of women could only have been written with the intention of breaking off the connection and accordingly we hear no more of poor varina at laracor a mile or two from trim and twenty miles from dublin swift ministered to a congregation of about fifteen persons and had abundant leisure for cultivating his garden making a canal after the dutch fashion of moor park planting willows and rebuilding the vicarage as chaplain to lord berkeley he spent much of his time in dublin he was on intimate terms with lady berkeley and her daughters one of whom is best known by her married name of lady betty germaine and through them he had access to the fashionable society of dublin when lord berkeley returned to england in april swift after taking his doctor s degree at dublin went with him and soon afterwards published anonymously a political pamphlet a discourse on the contests and dissentions in athens and rome when he returned to ireland in september he was accompanied by stella to give esther johnson the name by which she is best known and her friend mrs dingley stella s fortune was about pounds and the property temple had left her was in county wicklow swift very much for his own satisfaction who had few friends or acquaintance in ireland persuaded stella now twenty years old that living was cheaper there than in england and that a better return was obtainable on money the ladies took his advice and

pamphlet as a contribution to criticism or critical theory defoe s comments upon specific writers are thoroughly conventional and commonplace as may be seen from a glance at his remarks about milton chaucer spenser shakespeare and others on p of more interest is his very high praise of dryden a man for learning and universal writing in poetry perhaps the greatest that england has produc d p l and his comment upon the critical detraction from which he suffered he compares pope interestingly enough with dryden remarking that pope a person tho inferior to mr dryden yet speaking impartially has few superiors in this age also is persecuted by envy and he has generous praise for that poet s translation of homer one may note that defoe avoids the shortcomings of the critics whom he condemns for judging according to party he distributes his praise indiscriminately between whig and tory writers in short his essay hardly does more than confirm the critical commonplaces of the time and attest to the catholicity of the author s taste of particular interest for students of defoe is the paragraph p l in which defoe defends the hack writers who must write for subsistence one should not expect their writings which are necessarily numerous to be as correct and finished as they might be after comparing their pens to prostitutes because of their venality he claims in a half ironic tone for both authors and booksellers the liberty of writing and printing for either or both sides without ignominy after all they must write and print to live such practice is certainly he observes no more unjust or disreputable than other ways of gaining wealth such as one finds in exchange alley this paragraph gains point when one remembers that defoe had served both whig and tory governments in as letters written to lord stanhope in that very year testify he was engaged in the perhaps dubious business of masquerading as a tory while actually in the service of the whig ministry to take the sting out of the more violent tory periodicals and he was much concerned with the danger of his ambiguous position in december of he had been identified as a writer for mist s weekly journal the leading tory paper and was subjected to growing attacks in the whig press one can hardly doubt that this paragraph is a thinly veiled defense of his own practice as a professional journalist it is no surprise to find the author of a vindication in discussing the qualifications of writers advocating the importance of genius and natural parts above mere learning he instances the author of the true born englishman and shakespeare the former characteriz d as a person of little learning but of prodigious natural parts and the latter having but a small share of literature the further example of the literary achievements of the fair sex who had of course no university education reminds one of defoe s championship elsewhere of women the business of a writer is to please and inform and the general implication is that genius is more necessary to this end than learning also characteristic of defoe is his emphasis upon the advantage to an author of conversation the aliment of genius the life of all airy performances p likewise his digression upon education pp f his charge that people of quality in england all too often neglect their children s education his remarks upon the advantages of travel and the need of training in the vernacular all will be familiar to readers of defoe a vindication of the press is chiefly important for the corroboration of our knowledge of daniel defoe it presents nothing that is new but it gives further evidence of his pride in authorship of his rationalization of his actions as a professional journalist and of his belief in the importance of a free press many of his characteristic ideas are repeated with his usual consistency in point of view although the critical comments in the essay are thoroughly conventional they offer evidence of contemporary literary judgments and reveal defoe as a well informed man of moderation and commonsense though certainly not as a profound critic in the catholicity of his tastes and interests defoe is far ahead of his puritan fellows and his essay may be taken as one indication of the growing interest of the middle classes for whom he wrote in the greater world of literature as professor trent remarks in his ms notes defoe rarely wrote a tract without introducing something worthy of attention and comment and the present pamphlet is no exception to the rule i should like to thank dr henry c

now of his son the lord castlemain of which hereafter went over the same river which we now pass at ilford and passing that part of the great forest which we now call hainault forest came into that which is now the great road a little on this side the whalebone a place on the road so called because the rib bone of a great whale which was taken in the river thames the same year that oliver cromwell died was fixed there for a monument of that monstrous creature it being at first about eight and twenty feet long according to my first intention of effectually viewing the sea coast of these three counties i went from stratford to barking a large market town but chiefly inhabited by fishermen whose smacks ride in the thames at the mouth of their river from whence their fish is sent up to london to the market at billingsgate by small boats of which i shall speak by itself in my description of london one thing i cannot omit in the mention of these barking fisher smacks viz that one of those fishermen a very substantial and experienced man convinced me that all the pretences to bringing fish alive to london market from the north seas and other remote places on the coast of great britain by the new built sloops called fish pools have not been able to do anything but what their fishing smacks are able on the same occasion to perform these fishing smacks are very useful vessels to the public upon many occasions as particularly in time of war they are used as press smacks running to all the northern and western coasts to pick up seamen to man the navy when any expedition is at hand that requires a sudden equipment at other times being excellent sailors they are tenders to particular men of war and on an expedition they have been made use of as machines for the blowing up of fortified ports and havens as at calais st malo and other places this parish of barking is very large and by the improvement of lands taken in out of the thames and out of the river which runs by the town the tithes as the townsmen assured me are worth above pounds per annum including small tithes note this parish has two or three chapels of ease viz one at ilford and one on the side of hainault forest called new chapel sir thomas fanshaw of an ancient roman catholic family has a very good estate in this parish a little beyond the town on the road to dagenham stood a great house ancient and now almost fallen down where tradition says the gunpowder treason plot was at first contrived and that all the first consultations about it were held there this side of the county is rather rich in land than in inhabitants occasioned chiefly by the unhealthiness of the air for these low marsh grounds which with all the south side of the county have been saved out of the river thames and out of the sea where the river is wide enough to be called so begin here or rather begin at west ham by stratford and continue to extend themselves from hence eastward growing wider and wider till we come beyond tilbury when the flat country lies six seven or eight miles broad and is justly said to be both unhealthy and unpleasant however the lands are rich and as is observable it is very good farming in the marshes because the landlords let good pennyworths for it being a place where everybody cannot live those that venture it will have encouragement and indeed it is but reasonable they should several little observations i made in this part of the county of essex we saw passing from barking to dagenham the famous breach made by an inundation of the thames which was so great as that it laid near acres of land under water but which after near ten years lying under water and being several times blown up has been at last effectually stopped by the application of captain perry the gentleman who for several years had been employed in the czar of muscovy s works at veronitza on the river don this breach appeared now effectually made up and they assured us that the new work where the breach was is by much esteemed the strongest of all the sea walls in that level it was observable that great part of the lands in these levels especially those on this side east tilbury are held by the farmers cow keepers and grazing butchers who live in and near london and that they are generally stocked all the winter half year with large fat sheep viz lincolnshire and leicestershire wethers which they buy in smithfield in september and october when the lincolnshire and leicestershire graziers sell off their stock and are kept here till christmas or candlemas or thereabouts and though they are not made at all fatter here than they were when bought in yet the farmer or butcher finds very good advantage in it by the difference of the price of mutton between michaelmas when it is cheapest and candlemas when it is dearest this is what the butchers value themselves upon when they tell us at the market that it is right marsh mutton in the bottom of these marshes and close to the edge of the river stands the strong fortress of tilbury called tilbury fort which may justly be looked upon as the key of the river thames and consequently the key of the city of london it is a regular fortification the design of it was a pentagon but the water bastion as it would have been called was never built the plan was laid out by sir martin beckman chief engineer to

put us into an imperfect state where we have perpetual occasion of each other s assistance there is none so low as not to be in a capacity of assisting the highest nor so high as not to want the assistance of the lowest it plainly appears from what hath been said that no one human creature is more worthy than another in the sight of god further than according to the goodness or holiness of their lives and that power wealth and the like outward advantages are so far from being the marks of god s approving or preferring those on whom they are bestowed that on the contrary he is pleased to suffer them to be almost engrossed by those who have least title to his favour now according to this equality wherein god hath placed all mankind with relation to himself you will observe that in all the relations between man and man there is a mutual dependence whereby the one cannot subsist without the other thus no man can be a prince without subjects nor a master without servants nor a father without children and this both explains and confirms the doctrine of the text for where there is a mutual dependence there must be a mutual duty and consequently a mutual subjection for instance the subject must obey his prince because god commands it human laws require it and the safety of the public makes it necessary for the same reasons we must obey all that are in authority and submit ourselves not only to the good and gentle but also to the froward whether they rule according to our liking or not on the other side in those countries that pretend to freedom princes are subject to those laws which their people have chosen they are bound to protect their subjects in liberty property and religion to receive their petitions and redress their grievances so that the best prince is in the opinion of wise men only the greatest servant of the nation not only a servant to the public in general but in some sort to every man in it in the like manner a servant owes obedience and diligence and faithfulness to his master from whom at the same time he hath a just demand for protection and maintenance and gentle treatment nay even the poor beggar hath a just demand of an alms from the rich man who is guilty of fraud injustice and oppression if he does not afford relief according to his abilities but this subjection we all owe one another is nowhere more necessary than in the common conversations of life for without it there could be no society among men if the learned would not sometimes submit to the ignorant the wise to the simple the gentle to the froward the old to the weaknesses of the young there would be nothing but everlasting variance in the world this our saviour himself confirmed by his own example for he appeared in the form of a servant and washed his disciples feet adding those memorable words ye call me lord and master and ye say well for so i am if i then your lord and master wash your feet how much more ought ye to wash one another s feet under which expression of washing the feet is included all that subjection assistance love and duty which every good christian ought to pay his brother in whatever station god hath placed him for the greatest prince and the meanest slave are not by infinite degrees so distant as our saviour and those disciples whose feet he vouchsafed to wash and although this doctrine of subjecting ourselves to one another may seem to grate upon the pride and vanity of mankind and may therefore be hard to be digested by those who value themselves upon their greatness or their wealth yet it is really no more than what most men practise upon other occasions for if our neighbour who is our inferior comes to see us we rise to receive him we place him above us and respect him as if he were better than ourselves and this is thought both decent and necessary and is usually called good manners now the duty required by the apostle is only that we should enlarge our minds and that what we thus practise in the common course of life we should imitate in all our actions and proceedings whatsoever since our saviour tells us that every man is our neighbour and since we are so ready in point of civility to yield to others in our own houses where only we have any title to govern having thus shown you what sort of subjection it is which all men owe one another and in what manner it ought to be paid i shall now draw some observations from what hath been said and first a thorough practice of this duty of subjecting ourselves to the wants and infirmities of each other would utterly extinguish in us the vice of pride for if god has pleased to intrust me with a talent not for my own sake but for the service of others and at the same time hath left me full of wants and necessities which others must supply i can then have no cause to set any extraordinary value upon myself or to despise my brother because he hath not the same talents which were lent to me his being may probably be as useful to the public as mine and therefore by the rules of right reason i am in no sort preferable to him secondly it is very manifest from what has been said that no man ought to look upon the advantages of life such as riches honour power and the like as his property but merely as a trust which god hath deposited with him to be employed for the use of his brethren and god will certainly punish the breach of that trust though the laws of man will not or rather indeed cannot because the trust was conferred only by god who has not left it to any power on earth to decide infallibly whether a man makes a good use of his talents or not or to punish him where he fails and therefore god seems to have more particularly taken this matter into his own hands and will most certainly reward or punish

greater weaknesses such was even the great paracelsus the wonder and miracle of learning in the age wherein he lived and such were all his followers scholars statesmen divines and princes that are talismanists these talismans that paracelsus pretends to owe to the excogitation and invention of honest art seem to me to be of a very diabolical nature and to owe their rise to being dedicated by the author to the heathen gods thus the cabalists pretending to a vast penetration into arts and sciences though all their thoughts are chimeras and extravagancies unless they be helped by preternatural means say they have found out the several methods appropriated to the several planets they have appropriated gold to the sun on the sunday silver to the moon on the monday iron to mars

time later fallen into an argument with one of his troopers concerning the mystery of the trinity the man who was a half crazy zealot smote my father across the face a favour which he returned by a thrust from his broadsword which sent his adversary to test in person the truth of his beliefs in most armies it would have been conceded that my father was within his rights in punishing promptly so rank an act of mutiny but the soldiers of cromwell had so high a notion of their own importance and privileges that they resented this summary justice upon their companion a court martial sat upon my father and it is likely that he would have been offered up as a sacrifice to appease the angry soldiery had not the lord protector interfered and limited the punishment to dismissal from the army cornet clarke was accordingly stripped of his buff coat and steel cap and wandered down to havant where he settled into business as a leather merchant and tanner thereby depriving parliament of as trusty a soldier as ever drew blade in its service finding that he prospered in trade he took as wife mary shepstone a young churchwoman and i micah clarke was the first pledge of their union my father as i remember him first was tall and straight with a great spread of shoulder and a mighty chest his face was craggy and stern with large harsh features shaggy over hanging brows high bridged fleshy nose and a full lipped mouth which tightened and set when he was angry his grey eyes were piercing and soldier like yet i have seen them lighten up into a kindly and merry twinkle his voice was the most tremendous and awe inspiring that i have ever listened to i can well believe what i have heard that when he chanted the hundredth psalm as he rode down among the blue bonnets at dunbar the sound of him rose above the blare of trumpets and the crash of guns like the deep roll of a breaking wave yet though he possessed every quality which was needed to raise him to distinction as an officer he had thrown off his military habits when he returned to civil life as he prospered and grew rich he might well have worn a sword but instead he would ever bear a small copy of the scriptures bound to his girdle where other men hung their weapons he was sober and measured in his speech and it was seldom even in the bosom of his own family that he would speak of the scenes which he had taken part in or of the great men fleetwood and harrison blake and ireton desborough and lambert some of whom had been simple troopers like himself when the troubles broke out he was frugal in his eating backward in drinking and allowed himself no pleasures save three pipes a day of oronooko tobacco which he kept ever in a brown jar by the great wooden chair on the left hand side of the mantelshelf yet for all his self restraint the old leaven would at times begin to work in him and bring on fits of what his enemies would call fanaticism and his friends piety though it must be confessed that this piety was prone to take a fierce and fiery shape as i look back one or two instances of that stand out so hard and clear in my recollection that they might be scenes which i had seen of late in the playhouse instead of memories of my childhood more than threescore years ago when the second charles was on the throne the first of these occurred when i was so young that i can remember neither what went before nor what immediately after it it stuck in my infant mind when other things slipped through it we were all in the house one sultry summer evening when there came a rattle of kettledrums and a clatter of hoofs which brought my mother and my father to the door she with me in her arms that i might have the better view it was a regiment of horse on their way from chichester to portsmouth with colours flying and band playing making the bravest show that ever my youthful eyes had rested upon with what wonder and admiration did i gaze at the sleek prancing steeds the steel morions the plumed hats of the officers the scarfs and bandoliers never i thought had such a gallant company assembled and i clapped my hands and cried out in my delight my father smiled gravely and took me from my mother s arms nay lad he said thou art a soldier s son and should have more judgment than to commend such a rabble as this canst thou not child as thou art see that their arms are ill found their stirrup irons rusted and their ranks without order or cohesion neither have they thrown out a troop in advance as should even in times of peace be done and their rear is straggling from here to bedhampton yea he continued suddenly shaking his long arm at the troopers and calling out to them ye are corn ripe for the sickle and waiting only for the reapers several of them reined up at this sudden out flame hit the crop eared rascal over the pate jack cried one to another wheeling his horse round but there was that in my father s face which caused him to fall back into the ranks again with his purpose unfulfilled the regiment jingled on down the road and my mother laid her thin hands upon my father s arm and lulled with her pretty coaxing ways the sleeping devil which had stirred within him on another occasion which i can remember about my seventh or eighth year his wrath burst out with more dangerous effect i was playing about him as he worked in the tanning yard one spring afternoon when in through the open doorway strutted two stately gentlemen with gold facings to their coats and smart cockades at the side of their three cornered hats they were

ca ira something to distract the minds of the populace from the consequences of its own deeds and the helplessness of its legislators procureur chaumette enlarged upon his original idea like a true artist who sees the broad effect of a picture at a glance and then fills in the minute details he was already busy elaborating his scheme the goddess must be beautiful not too young reason can only go hand in hand with the riper age of second youth she must be decked out in classical draperies severe yet suggestive she must be rouged and painted for she is a mere idol easily to be appeased with incense music and laughter he was getting deeply interested in his subject seeking minutiae of detail with which to render his theme more and more attractive but patience was never the characteristic of the revolutionary government of france the national assembly soon tired of chaumette s dithyrambic utterances up aloft on the mountain danton was yawning like a gigantic leopard soon henriot was on his feet he had a far finer scheme than that of the procureur to place before his colleagues a grand national fete semi religious in character but of the new religion which destroyed and desecrated and never knelt in worship citizen chaumette s goddess of reason by all means henriot conceded that the idea was a good one but the goddess merely as a figure head around her a procession of unfrocked and apostate priests typifying the destruction of ancient hierarchy mules carrying loads of sacred vessels the spoils of ten thousand churches of france and ballet girls in bacchanalian robes dancing the carmagnole around the new deity public prosecutor foucquier tinville thought all these schemes very tame why should the people of france be led to think that the era of a new religion would mean an era of milk and water of pageants and of fireworks let every man woman and child know that this was an era of blood and again of blood oh he exclaimed in passionate accents would that all the traitors in france had but one head that it might be cut off with one blow of the guillotine he approved of the national fete but he desired an apotheosis of the guillotine he undertook to find ten thousand traitors to be beheaded on one grand and glorious day ten thousand heads to adorn the place de la revolution on a great never to be forgotten evening after the guillotine had accomplished this record work but collot d herbois would also have his say collot lately hailed from the south with a reputation for ferocity unparalleled throughout the whole of this horrible decade he would not be outdone by tinville s bloodthirsty schemes he was the inventor of the noyades which had been so successful at lyons and marseilles why not give the inhabitants of paris one of these exhilarating spectacles he asked with a coarse brutal laugh then he explained his invention of which he was inordinately proud some two or three hundred traitors men women and children tied securely together with ropes in great human bundles and thrown upon a barge in the middle of the river the barge with a hole in her bottom not too large only sufficient to cause her to sink slowly very slowly in sight of the crowd of delighted spectators the cries of the women and children and even of the men as they felt the waters rising and gradually enveloping them as they felt themselves powerless even for a fruitless struggle had proved most exhilarating so citizen collot declared to the hearts of the true patriots of lyons thus the discussion continued this was the era when every man had but one desire that of outdoing others in ferocity and brutality and but one care that of saving his own head by threatening that of his neighbour the great duel between the titanic leaders of these turbulent parties the conflict between hot headed danton on the one side and cold blooded robespierre on the other had only just begun the great all devouring monsters had dug their claws into one another but the issue of the combat was still at stake neither of these two giants had taken part in these deliberations anent the new religion and the new goddess danton gave signs now and then of the greatest impatience and muttered something about a new form of tyranny a new kind of oppression on the left robespierre in immaculate sea green coat and carefully gauffered linen was quietly polishing the nails of his right hand against the palm of his left but nothing escaped him of what was going on his ferocious egoism his unbounded ambition was even now calculating what advantages to himself might accrue from this idea of the new religion and of the national fete what personal aggrandisement he could derive therefrom the matter outwardly seemed trivial enough but already his keen and calculating mind had seen various side issues which might tend to place him robespierre on a yet higher and more unassailable pinnacle surrounded by those who hated him those who envied and those who feared him he ruled over them all by the strength of his own cold blooded savagery by the resistless power of his merciless cruelty he cared about nobody but himself about nothing but his own exaltation every action of his career since he gave up his small practice in a quiet provincial town in order to throw himself into the wild vortex of revolutionary politics every word he ever uttered

pamphlet as a contribution to criticism or critical theory defoe s comments upon specific writers are thoroughly conventional and commonplace as may be seen from a glance at his remarks about milton chaucer spenser shakespeare and others on p of more interest is his very high praise of dryden a man for learning and universal writing in poetry perhaps the greatest that england has produc d p l and his comment upon the critical detraction from which he suffered he compares pope interestingly enough with dryden remarking that pope a person tho inferior to mr dryden yet speaking impartially has few superiors in this age also is persecuted by envy and he has generous praise for that poet s translation of homer one may note that defoe avoids the shortcomings of the critics whom he condemns for judging according to party he distributes his praise indiscriminately between whig and tory writers in short his essay hardly does more than confirm the critical commonplaces of the time and attest to the catholicity of the author s taste of particular interest for students of defoe is the paragraph p l in which defoe defends the hack writers who must write for subsistence one should not expect their writings which are necessarily numerous to be as correct and finished as they might be after comparing their pens to prostitutes because of their venality he claims in a half ironic tone for both authors and booksellers the liberty of writing and printing for either or both sides without ignominy after all they must write and print to live such practice is certainly he observes no more unjust or disreputable than other ways of gaining wealth such as one finds in exchange alley this paragraph gains point when one remembers that defoe had served both whig and tory governments in as letters written to lord stanhope in that very year testify he was engaged in the perhaps dubious business of masquerading as a tory while actually in the service of the whig ministry to take the sting out of the more violent tory periodicals and he was much concerned with the danger of his ambiguous position in december of he had been identified as a writer for mist s weekly journal the leading tory paper and was subjected to growing attacks in the whig press one can hardly doubt that this paragraph is a thinly veiled defense of his own practice as a professional journalist it is no surprise to find the author of a vindication in discussing the qualifications of writers advocating the importance of genius and natural parts above mere learning he instances the author of the true born englishman and shakespeare the former characteriz d as a person of little learning but of prodigious natural parts and the latter having but a small share of literature the further example of the literary achievements of the fair sex who had of course no university education reminds one of defoe s championship elsewhere of women the business of a writer is to please and inform and the general implication is that genius is more necessary to this end than learning also characteristic of defoe is his emphasis upon the advantage to an author of conversation the aliment of genius the life of all airy performances p likewise his digression upon education pp f his charge that people of quality in england all too often neglect their children s education his remarks upon the advantages of travel and the need of training in the vernacular all will be familiar to readers of defoe a vindication of the press is chiefly important for the corroboration of our knowledge of daniel defoe it presents nothing that is new but it gives further evidence of his pride in authorship of his rationalization of his actions as a professional journalist and of his belief in the importance of a free press many of his characteristic ideas are repeated with his usual consistency in point of view although the critical comments in the essay are thoroughly conventional they offer evidence of contemporary literary judgments and reveal defoe as a well informed man of moderation and commonsense though certainly not as a profound critic in the catholicity of his tastes and interests defoe is far ahead of his puritan fellows and his essay may be taken as one indication of the growing interest of the middle classes for whom he wrote in the greater world of literature as professor trent

separated at the outset i never saw him when we forded the river when we planted the english flag in the first breach when we crossed the ditch beyond and fighting every inch of our way entered the town it was only at dusk when the place was ours and after general baird himself had found the dead body of tippoo under a heap of the slain that herncastle and i met we were each attached to a party sent out by the general s orders to prevent the plunder and confusion which followed our conquest the camp followers committed deplorable excesses and worse still the soldiers found their way by a guarded door into the treasury of the palace and loaded themselves with gold and jewels it was in the court outside the treasury that my cousin and i met to enforce the laws of discipline on our own soldiers herncastle s fiery temper had been as i could plainly see exasperated to a kind of frenzy by the terrible slaughter through which we had passed he was very unfit in my opinion to perform the duty that had been entrusted to him there was riot and confusion enough in the treasury but no violence that i saw the men if i may use such an expression disgraced themselves good humouredly all sorts of rough jests and catchwords were bandied about among them and the story of the diamond turned up again unexpectedly in the form of a mischievous joke who s got the moonstone was the rallying cry which perpetually caused the plundering as soon as it was stopped in one place to break out in another while i was still vainly trying to establish order i heard a frightful yelling on the other side of the courtyard and at once ran towards the cries in dread of finding some new outbreak of the pillage in that direction i got to an open door and saw the bodies of two indians by their dress as i guessed officers of the palace lying across the entrance dead a cry inside hurried me into a room which appeared to serve as an armoury a third indian mortally wounded was sinking at the feet of a man whose back was towards me the man turned at the instant when i came in and i saw john herncastle with a torch in one hand and a dagger dripping with blood in the other a stone set like a pommel in the end of the dagger s handle flashed in the torchlight as he turned on me like a gleam of fire the dying indian sank to his knees pointed to the dagger in herncastle s hand and said in his native language the moonstone will have its vengeance yet on you and yours he spoke those words and fell dead on the floor before i could stir in the matter the men who had followed me across the courtyard crowded in my cousin rushed to meet them like a madman clear the room he shouted to me and set a guard on the door the men fell back as he threw himself on them with his torch and his dagger i put two sentinels of my own company on whom i could rely to keep the door through the remainder of the night i saw no more of my cousin early in the morning the plunder still going on general baird announced publicly by beat of drum that any thief detected in the fact be he whom he might should be hung the provost marshal was in attendance to prove that the general was in earnest and in the throng that followed the proclamation herncastle and i met again he held out his hand as usual and said good morning i waited before i gave him my hand in return tell me first i said how the indian in the armoury met his death and what those last words meant when he pointed to the dagger in your hand the indian met his death as i suppose by a mortal wound said herncastle what his last words meant i know no more than you do i looked at him narrowly his frenzy of the previous day had all calmed down i determined to give him another chance is that all you have to tell me i asked he answered that is all i turned my back on him and we have not spoken since iv i beg it to be understood that what i write here about my cousin unless some necessity should arise for making it public is for the information of the family only herncastle has said nothing that can justify me in speaking to our commanding officer he has been taunted more than once about the diamond by those who recollect his angry outbreak before the assault but as may easily be imagined his own remembrance of the circumstances under which i surprised him in the armoury has been enough to keep him silent it is reported that he means to exchange into another regiment avowedly for the purpose of separating himself from me whether this be true or not i cannot prevail upon myself to become his accuser and i think with good reason if i made the matter public i have no evidence but moral evidence to bring forward i have not only no proof that he killed the two men at the door i cannot even declare that he killed the third man inside for i cannot say that my own eyes saw the deed committed it is true that i heard the dying indian s words but if those words were pronounced to be the ravings of delirium how could i contradict the assertion from my own knowledge let our relatives on either side form their own opinion on what i have written and decide for themselves whether the aversion i now feel towards this man is well or ill founded although i attach no sort of credit to the fantastic indian legend of the gem i must acknowledge before i conclude that i am influenced by a certain superstition of my own in this matter it is my conviction or my delusion no matter which that crime brings its own fatality with it i am not only persuaded of herncastle s guilt i am even fanciful enough to believe that he will live to regret it if he keeps the diamond and that others will live to regret taking it from him if he gives the diamond away

south seas a trade carried on with the greatest advantage and to the greatest degree that any particular commerce has been carried on in the world for many ages past insomuch that we found the return of silver that came back to france by those ships was not only the enriching of the merchants of st malo rochelle and other ports in france some of whom we saw get immense estates in a few years even to a million sterling a man but it was evident the king of france himself was enabled by the circulation of so much bullion through his mints to carry on that war with very great advantage it was just at the close of this war when some merchants of london looking with envy on the success of that trade and how the french notwithstanding the peace would apparently carry it on for some years at least to infinite advantage began to consider whether it might not be possible to come in for a portion of it with france as they were allied to spain and yet go abroad in the nature of a private cruiser to bring this to pass it was thought proper in the first place to get a share if possible in a new design of an east india trade in flanders just then intended to be set up by some british merchants by the assistance of an imperial charter or at least under colour of it and so we might go to sea in a threefold capacity to be made use of as occasion might present viz when on the coast of new spain we sought to trade we were frenchmen had a french captain and a sufficient number of french seamen and flemish or walloon seamen who spoke french so to appear on all proper occasions when at sea we met with any spanish ship worth our while we were english cruisers had letters of mart from england had no account of the peace and were fitted for the attack and when in the east indies we had occasion to trade either at the english or dutch settlements we should have imperial colours and two flemish merchants at least in appearance to transact everything as we found occasion however this last part of our project failed us that affair not being fully ripe as this mysterious equipment may be liable to some exceptions and perhaps to some inquiries i shall for the present conceal my name and that of the ship also by inquiries i mean inquiries of private persons concerned for as to public inquiries we have no uneasiness having acted nothing in contradiction to the rules and laws of our country but i say as to private persons it is thought fit to prevent their inquiries to which end the captain in whose name i write this gives me leave to make use of his name and conceal my own the ship sailed from the river the th of december and went directly over to the coast of flanders lying at an anchor in newport pitts as they are called where we took in our french captain jean michael merlotte who with thirty two french seamen came on board us in a large snow from dunkirk bringing with them one hundred and twenty two small ankers or rundlets of brandy and some hampers and casks of french wine in wickered bottles while we were here we lay under english colours with pendants flying our ship being upwards of five hundred ton and had forty six guns mounted manned with three hundred and fifty six men we took the more men on board because we resolved as occasion should present to fit ourselves with another ship which we did not question we should meet with in the south seas we had also a third design in our voyage though it may be esteemed an accident to the rest viz we were resolved to make some attempts for new discoveries as opportunity offered and we had two persons on board who were exceeding well qualified for our direction in this part all which was derived from the following occasion the person who was principally concerned in the adventure was a man not only of great wealth but of great importance he was particularly addicted to what we call new discoveries and it was indeed upon his genius to such things that the first thought of the voyage was founded this gentleman told me that he had already sent one ship fully equipped and furnished for a new attempt upon the north west or north east passages which had been so often in vain tried by former navigators and that he did not question the success because he had directed them by new measures and to steer a course that was never attempted yet and his design in our voyage was to make like discoveries towards the south pole where as he said and gave us very good reasons for it he did not doubt but we might discover even to the pole itself and find out new worlds and new seas which had never been heard of before with these designs this gentleman came into the other part of our project and contributed the more largely and with the more freedom to the whole upon that account in particular all

peers whose poverty made them dependent on governmental subsidies but this number would not have given harley even a bare majority in the strongly whig house of lords and there harley needed at least enough strength to ensure success for some of the measures designed to satisfy the demands of the newly tory house of commons particularly if his ministry was to be able to negotiate a satisfactory treaty of peace with france to obtain a tory majority in the house of lords commensurate with the one in commons harley could have seen to the creation of a sufficient number of new peerages but this would have alienated too many factions and the recently completed union with scotland offered what appeared to be a far simpler expedient the act of union provided for the election of sixteen scottish peers who would represent all of the scottish nobility in the house of lords if he could ensure that all sixteen of these peers were tory harley would be certain of a large block of loyal votes in the upper house or at worst he would have to arrange for the creation of only a few new peers to neutralize the whigs strength to john campbell the second duke of argyll harley assigned the task of orchestrating a tory sweep in this election the duke of argyll sat in the house of lords as the earl of greenwich an english title not as one of the elected peers and as such he was not elegible to stand as a candidate or to vote in this election argyll had supported the whig junto and held the rank of lieutenant general under marlborough in france but in seeing the direction the political tide was taking he abandoned his support of godolphin s ministry so that by the time the sacheverell trial was finished it was known that the great chief of the campbells and of the scottish whigs had gone into opposition to the government of godolphin in league with harley although he voted for the doctor s condemnation argyll and the sixteen representative peers if they were all tories together with the votes of those peers who were dependant upon government subsidies would give the new ministry of harley enough votes in the upper house for almost any eventuality even the impeachment of marlborough it is possible to speculate that this was the plum command of the british armies in europe that induced argyll s change from whig to tory in argyll s jealousy and resentment of his commander had been a well known bit of gossip for some time and it is very possible that argyll saw a new government as his chance to steal a march on marlborough although harley s ministry did give the order of the garter to argyll on december he was never promoted over marlborough but that was not due to any lack of success in assuring a tory victory in the election of the peers argyll s heavy handed management of that election is the subject of defoe s atalantis major by birth and education daniel defoe was a member of the mercantile middle class he was a dissenter and his political and economic sympathies generally coincided with those of the moderate whigs a limited monarchy the destruction of france s commercial empire liberty of conscience for dissenters and nonconformists and a protestant that is hanover succession were the imperatives which lay behind much of his political and economic thinking and writing from as early as he had served william iii as a pamphleteer propagandist for the vigorous prosecution of the war with france after his five month imprisonment in for writing the shortest way with dissenters defoe was employed as an agent and pamphleteer of the government first in the service of robert harley godolphin s secretary of state during the early moderate years of the godolphin administration and thereafter working for godolphin himself defoe s review preached the gospel of national unity above party faction when harley replaced godolphin as treasurer in defoe returned to his service although it may appear from this that defoe s pen was for hire by whichever party was in power in point of fact defoe s political views were remarkably congruent with those of both harley and godolphin all three were staunch supporters of england s commercial interests the hanoverian succession liberty of conscience for dissenters and nonconformists and the terms of the revolution settlement it must be remembered that godolphin and harley were both moderates each trying to chart his course between the extremes of the parties they like daniel defoe saw their loyalty being to england and to the queen not to a party like defoe they both discovered that politics often make strange bedfellows godolphin faced with a large whig majority in the house of commons after the general election of found that his fortunes were bound to those of the junto harley after the general election of discovered the necessity of courting the high church tories far more than he would have liked argyll s slate of scottish peers for the november election included men who were even more extreme in their toryism than the majority of high church english tories most of the sixteen were high church many had strong catholic leanings all of them were against increasing the religious liberties of the scottish presbyterians and thus those of the english dissenters and nonconformists several of these peers had been openly professed jacobites and all were in some degree sympathetic to france to have men with such beliefs in parliament meant to defoe the chance that marlborough s victories in france would be negotiated away the loss of what the toleration

ca ira something to distract the minds of the populace from the consequences of its own deeds and the helplessness of its legislators procureur chaumette enlarged upon his original idea like a true artist who sees the broad effect of a picture at a glance and then fills in the minute details he was already busy elaborating his scheme the goddess must be beautiful not too young reason can only go hand in hand with the riper age of second youth she must be decked out in classical draperies severe yet suggestive she must be rouged and painted for she is a mere idol easily to be appeased with incense music and laughter he was getting deeply interested in his subject seeking minutiae of detail with which to render his theme more and more attractive but patience was never the characteristic of the revolutionary government of france the national assembly soon tired of chaumette s dithyrambic utterances up aloft on the mountain danton was yawning like a gigantic leopard soon henriot was on his feet he had a far finer scheme than that of the procureur to place before his colleagues a grand national fete semi religious in character but of the new religion which destroyed and desecrated and never knelt in worship citizen chaumette s goddess of reason by all means henriot conceded that the idea was a good one but the goddess merely as a figure head around her a procession of unfrocked and apostate priests typifying the destruction of ancient hierarchy mules carrying loads of sacred vessels the spoils of ten thousand churches of france and ballet girls in bacchanalian robes dancing the carmagnole around the new deity public prosecutor foucquier tinville thought all these schemes very tame why should the people of france be led to think that the era of a new religion would mean an era of milk and water of pageants and of fireworks let every man woman and child know that this was an era of blood and again of blood oh he exclaimed in passionate accents would that all the traitors in france had but one head that it might be cut off with one blow of the guillotine he approved of the national fete but he desired an apotheosis of the guillotine he undertook to find ten thousand traitors to be beheaded on one grand and glorious day ten thousand heads to adorn the place de la revolution on a great never to be forgotten evening after the guillotine had accomplished this record work but collot d herbois would also have his say collot lately hailed from the south with a reputation for ferocity unparalleled throughout the whole of this horrible decade he would not be outdone by tinville s bloodthirsty schemes he was the inventor of the noyades which had been so successful at lyons and marseilles why not give the inhabitants of paris one of these exhilarating spectacles he asked with a coarse brutal laugh then he explained his invention of which he was inordinately proud some two or three hundred traitors men women and children tied securely together with ropes in great human bundles and thrown upon a barge in the middle of the river the barge with a hole in her bottom not too large only sufficient to cause her to sink slowly very slowly in sight of the crowd of delighted spectators the cries of the women and children and even of the men as they felt the waters rising and gradually enveloping them as they felt themselves powerless even for a fruitless struggle had proved most exhilarating so citizen collot declared to the hearts of the true patriots of lyons thus the discussion continued this was the era when every man had but one desire that of outdoing others in ferocity and brutality and but one care that of saving his own head by threatening that of his neighbour the great duel between the titanic leaders of these turbulent parties the conflict between hot headed danton on the one side and cold blooded robespierre on the other had only just begun the great all devouring monsters had dug their claws into one another but the issue of the combat was still at stake neither of these two giants had taken part in these deliberations anent the new religion and the new goddess danton gave signs now and then of the greatest impatience and muttered something about a new form of tyranny a new kind of oppression on the left robespierre in immaculate sea green coat and carefully gauffered linen was quietly polishing the nails of his right hand against the palm of his left but nothing escaped him of what was going on his ferocious egoism his unbounded ambition was even now calculating what advantages to himself might accrue from this idea of the new religion and of the national fete what personal aggrandisement he could derive therefrom the matter outwardly seemed trivial enough but already his keen and calculating mind had seen various side issues which might tend to place him robespierre on a yet higher and more unassailable pinnacle surrounded by those who hated him those who envied and those who feared him he ruled over them all by the strength of his own cold blooded savagery by the resistless power of his merciless cruelty he cared about nobody but himself about nothing but his own

generally chosen because in that situation the essential passions of the heart find a better soil in which they can attain their maturity are less under restraint and speak a plainer and more emphatic language because in that situation our elementary feelings exist in a state of greater simplicity and consequently may be more accurately contemplated and more forcibly communicated because the manners of rural life germinate from those elementary feelings and from the necessary character of rural occupations are more easily comprehended and are more durable and lastly because in that situation the passions of men are incorporated with the beautiful and permanent forms of nature the language too of these men is adopted purified indeed from what appear to be its real defects from all lasting and rational causes of dislike or disgust because such men hourly communicate with the best objects from which the best part of language is originally derived and because from their rank in society and the sameness and narrow circle of their intercourse being less under the action of social vanity they convey their feelings and notions in simple and unelaborated expressions accordingly such a language arising out of repeated experience and regular feelings is a more permanent and a far more philosophical language than that which is frequently substituted for it by poets who think that they are conferring honour upon themselves and their art in proportion as they separate themselves from the sympathies of men and indulge in arbitrary and capricious habits of expression in order to furnish food for fickle tastes and fickle appetites of their own creation footnote it is worth while here to observe that the affecting parts of chaucer are almost always expressed in language pure and universally intelligible even to this day i cannot be insensible of the present outcry against the triviality and meanness both of thought and language which some of my contemporaries have occasionally introduced into their metrical compositions and i acknowledge that this defect where it exists is more dishonorable to the writer s own character than false refinement or arbitrary innovation though i should contend at the same time that it is far less pernicious in the sum of its consequences from such verses the poems in these volumes will be found distinguished at least by one mark of difference that each of them has a worthy purpose not that i mean to say that i always began to write with a distinct purpose formally conceived but i believe that my habits of meditation have so formed my feelings as that my descriptions of such objects as strongly excite those feelings will be found to carry along with them a purpose if in this opinion i am mistaken i can have little right to the name of a poet for all good poetry is the spontaneous overflow of powerful feelings but though this be true poems to which any value can be attached were never produced on any variety of subjects but by a man who being possessed of more than usual organic sensibility had also thought long and deeply for our continued influxes of feeling are modified and directed by our thoughts which are indeed the representatives of all our past feelings and as by contemplating the relation of these general representatives to each other we discover what is really important to men so by the repetition and continuance of this act feelings connected with important subjects will be nourished till at length if we be originally possessed of much organic sensibility such habits of mind will be produced that by obeying blindly and mechanically the impulses of those habits we shall describe objects and utter sentiments of such a nature and in such connection with each other that the understanding of the being to whom we address ourselves if he be in a healthful state of association must necessarily be in some degree enlightened his taste exalted and his affections ameliorated i have said that each of these poems has a purpose i have also informed my reader what this purpose will be found principally to be namely to illustrate the manner in which our feelings and ideas are associated in a state of excitement but speaking in less general language it is to follow the fluxes and refluxes of the mind when agitated by the great and simple affections of our nature this object i have endeavoured in these short essays to attain by various means by tracing the maternal passion through many of its more subtle windings as in the poems of the idiot boy and the mad mother by accompanying the last struggles of a human being at the approach of death cleaving in solitude to life and society as in the poem of the forsaken indian by shewing as in the stanzas entitled we are seven the perplexity and obscurity which in childhood attend our notion of death or rather our utter inability to admit that notion or by displaying the strength of fraternal or to speak more philosophically of moral attachment when early associated with the great and beautiful objects of nature as in the brothers or as in the incident of simon lee by placing my reader in the way of receiving from ordinary moral sensations another and more salutary impression than we are accustomed to receive from them it has also been part of my general purpose to attempt to sketch characters under the influence of less impassioned feelings as in the old man travelling the two thieves c characters of which the elements are simple belonging rather to nature than to manners such as exist now and will probably always exist and which from their constitution may be distinctly and profitably contemplated i will not abuse the indulgence of my reader by dwelling longer upon this subject but it

with the steamers who were paddling about like so many ducks steering in all directions though mostly crossing and re crossing at the ferries just as mulford turned away from his commander however a

that there is any such thing as a collateral sympathy a communication of circumstances between a nations follies and her fate any harmony between merit and mischief between the crimes of men and the vengeance of heaven we cannot but allow this extra pulpit admonition to be just and let not any man object against this being call d a sermon and its being introduc d from a text of scripture while the remainer of this discourse seems wholly civil and political if all our measures in civil affairs were deduc d as inferences from sacred texts i am of the opinion the text would be well improv d and publick matters never the worse guided and for this reason tho the subject be not treated with the gravity of a sermon nor in so serious a manner as would become a pulpit yet it may be not the less suitable to the occasion and for the manner it must be placed to the authors account besides the title i think has provided for the method and if so he that expected it otherwise than it is tis his fault and not mine the term sermon which is but sermo a speech may justify all the novelty of my method if those who find fault please to give themselves leave to allow it and since it has never profain d the pulpit i believe the text will receive no prejudice by it i wish every sermon equally improv d and what tho your humble servant be no man of the text if he be a man of honesty he may have a hand in making you all men of application in publick callamities every circumstance is a sermon and every thing we see a preacher the trembling habitations of an unthinking people preach to us and might have made any nation in the world tremble but us when we were rock d out of our sleep as children are rock d into it and when the terrible hand of soveraign power rock d many a wretch from one sleep to another and made a grave of the bed without the ceremony of waking in the passage the shatter d palaces of our princes preach to us and tell us aloud that without respect to dignity he is able to put that dreadful text in execution that if a nation does wickedly they shall be destroy d both they and their king the fallen oaks which stood before to tell us they were the longest liv d of all god s creatures preach to us and tell us that the most towring object of humane beauty and strength must lye humble and prostrate when he is pleased to give a check to that splendor which was deriv d from his power the wrecks of our navies and fleets preach to us that tis in vain we pretend to be wall d about by the ocean and ride masters of the sea and that if he who bestow d that scituation upon us thinks fit he can make that element which has been our strength and the encreaser of our wealth be the grave of our treasure and the enemy of our commerce he can put it into so violent agitation by the blast of his mouth that all our defence and the naval strength we have vallued our selves so much upon shall at once be swallow d up in the mouth of our friend the sea and we shall find our destruction in the very thing from which we expected our defence our seamen and soldiers whose dead bodies embrace the english shores preach aloud to us that whenever we think fit to embark them on any design which heaven approves not of he can blast the embrio and devour those people whose hands are lifted up against justice and right also they preach to us not to build our hopes of success upon the multitude of ships or men who are thus easily reduc d and the strength of a whole nation brought to ruine in a moment these are the monitors of our missfortunes and some of these admonitions would be well preach d from the mouths of those whose tallent as well as office gives them reason to do it and us to expect it but since the sons of the prophets have not yet thought it proper to enter very far into this matter not doubting but they will in due time find it as suitable to their inclination as tis to their duty in the mean time let us see if no uncommon application may be made of so uncommon a circumstance first tis matter of wonder that any man can be so senceless as to suppose there is nothing extraordinary in so signal an instance of a supream power but tis much more remarkable that those who have religion enough to own it a judgment are yet at a loss how to appropriate it s signification every one thinks it to be a judgment upon the person or parties they see touch d with it w the carpenter was knock d on the head with a stack of chimneys and his wife saved all the neighbours cried out twas a judgment upon him for keeping a whore but if stacks of

lawful soveraign and abjuring his posterity upon this head they have been preaching up repentance and humiliation to us and some of them are willing to reduce all to a very practical exhortation and tell us we ought to look upon it as a loud call to restore the right owner as they call him to the possession of his own again that is in short to rebel against a mild gentle just and protestant queen

engage in religious controversy and the furious contest civil and ecclesiastical which ensued on the accession of queen anne gave him an opportunity of gratifying his favourite passion he therefore published a tract entitled the shortest way with the dissenters or proposals for the establishment of the church which contained an ironical recommendation of persecution but written in so serious a strain that many persons particularly dissenters at first mistook its real intention the high church party however saw and felt the ridicule and by their influence a prosecution was commenced against him and a proclamation published in the gazette offering a reward for his apprehension when de foe found with how much rigour himself and his pamphlet were about to be treated he at first secreted himself but his printer and bookseller being taken into custody he surrendered being resolved as he expresses it to throw himself upon the favour of government rather than that others should be ruined for his mistakes in july he was brought to trial found guilty and sentenced to be imprisoned to stand in the pillory and to pay a fine of two hundred marks he underwent the infamous part of the punishment with great fortitude and it seems to have been generally thought that he was treated with unreasonable severity so far was he from being ashamed of his fate himself that he wrote a hymn to

newgate his family ruined and himself without hopes of deliverance till sir robert harley who approved of his principles and foresaw that during a factious age such a genius could be converted to many uses represented his unmerited sufferings to the queen and at length procured his release the treasurer lord godolphin also sent a considerable sum to his wife and family and to him money to pay his fine and the expense of his discharge gratitude and fidelity are inseparable from an honest man and it was this benevolent act that prompted de foe to support harley with his able and ingenious pen when anne lay lifeless and his benefactor in the vicissitude of party was persecuted by faction and overpowered though not conquered by violence the talents and perseverance of de foe began now to be properly estimated and as a firm supporter of the administration he was sent by lord godolphin to scotland on an errand which as he says was far from being unfit for a sovereign to direct or an honest man to perform his knowledge of commerce and revenue his powers of insinuation and above all his readiness of pen were deemed of no small utility in promoting the union of the two kingdoms of which he wrote an able history in with two dedications one to the queen and another to the duke of queensbury soon afterwards he unhappily by some equivocal writings rendered himself suspected by both parties so that he once more retired to newington in hopes of spending the remainder of his days in peace his pension being withdrawn and wearied with politics he began to compose works of a different kind the year may therefore be regarded as the period of de foe s political life faction henceforth found other advocates and parties procured other writers to disseminate their suggestions and to propagate their falsehoods in de foe published the family instructor a work inculcating the domestic duties in a lively manner by narration and dialogue and displaying much knowledge of life in the middle ranks of society religious courtship also appeared soon after which like the family instructor is eminently religious and moral in its tendency and strongly impresses on the mind that spirit of

the king to consent to a bill for triennial parliaments when swift took up his residence at moor park he found there a little girl of eight daughter of a merchant named edward johnson who had died young swift says that esther johnson was born on march in the parish register of richmond which shows that she was baptized on march her name is given as hester but she signed her will esther the name by which she was always known swift says her father was a younger brother of a good family in nottinghamshire her mother of a lower degree and indeed she had little to boast in her birth mrs johnson had two children esther and ann and lived at moor park as companion to lady giffard temple s widowed sister another member of the household afterwards to be esther s constant companion was rebecca dingley a relative of the temple family she was a year or two older than swift the lonely young man of twenty two was both playfellow and teacher of the delicate child of eight how he taught her to write has been charmingly brought before us in the painting exhibited by miss dicksee at the royal academy a few years ago he advised her what books to read and instructed her as he says in the principles of honour and virtue from which she never swerved in any one action or moment of her life by swift had grown tired of his position and finding that temple who valued his services was slow in finding him preferment he left moor park in order to carry out his resolve to go into the church he was ordained and obtained the prebend of kilroot near belfast where he carried on a flirtation with a miss waring whom he called varina but in may temple made proposals which induced swift to return to moor park where he was employed in preparing temple s memoirs and correspondence for publication and in supporting the side taken by temple in the letters of phalaris controversy by writing the battle of the books which was however not published until on his return to temple s house swift found his old playmate grown from a sickly child into a girl of fifteen in perfect health she came he says to be looked upon as one of the most beautiful graceful and agreeable young women in london only a little too fat her hair was blacker than a raven and every feature of her face in perfection on his death in january temple left a will dated directing the payment of pounds each with half a year s wages to bridget johnson and all my other servants and leaving a lease of some land in monistown county wicklow to esther johnson servant to my sister giffard by a codicil of february temple left pounds to mr jonathan swift now living with me it may be added that by her will of proved in the following year lady giffard gave pounds to mrs moss mrs bridget johnson who had married richard mose or moss lady giffard s steward the will proceeds to mrs hester sic johnson i give pounds with the pounds i put into the exchequer for her life and my own and declare the pounds to be hers which i am told is there in my name upon the survivorship and for which she has constantly sent over her certificate and received the interest i give her besides my two little silver candlesticks temple left in swift s hands the task of publishing his posthumous works a duty which afterwards led to a quarrel with lady giffard and other members of the family many years later swift told lord palmerston that he stopped at moor park solely for the benefit of temple s conversation and advice and the opportunity of pursuing his studies at temple s death he was as far to seek as ever in the summer of however he was offered and accepted the post of secretary and chaplain to the earl of berkeley one of the lords justices but when he reached ireland he found that the secretaryship had been given to another he soon however obtained the living of laracor agher and rathbeggan and the prebend of dunlavin in st patrick s cathedral dublin the total value of these preferments was about pounds a year an income which miss waring seems to have thought enough to justify him in marrying swift s reply to the lady whom he had singled out at first from the rest of women could only have been written with the intention of breaking off the connection and accordingly we hear no more of poor varina at laracor a mile or two from trim and twenty miles from dublin swift ministered to a congregation of about fifteen persons and had abundant leisure for cultivating his garden making a canal after the dutch fashion of moor park planting willows and rebuilding the vicarage as chaplain to lord berkeley he spent much of his time in dublin he was on intimate terms with lady berkeley and her daughters one of whom is best known by her married name of lady betty germaine and through them he had access to the fashionable society of dublin when lord berkeley returned to england in april swift after taking his doctor s degree at dublin went with him and soon afterwards published anonymously a political pamphlet a discourse on the contests and dissentions in athens and rome when he returned to ireland in september he was accompanied by stella to give esther johnson the name by which she is best known and her friend mrs dingley stella s fortune was about pounds and the property temple had left her was in county wicklow swift very much for his own satisfaction who had few friends or acquaintance in ireland persuaded stella now twenty years old that living was cheaper there than in england and that a better return was obtainable on money the ladies took his advice and made ireland their home at first they felt themselves strangers in dublin the adventure looked so like a frolic

of twelve new peers harley s job of using diverse elements to form a moderate government became more complex he found it expedient to establish and maintain influence with groups ranging from the radical tory october club to swift s country squire and clergy examiner readers to moderate whigs such as shrewsbury moreover defoe had impressed upon him the importance of assuring the nation that moderate and sensible men were at the bottom of all of the political changes harley therefore prepared for at least three apparently exclusive possibilities prosecuting the war for several more years negotiating a peace with the allies or making a separate peace with france without the allies to keep all these possibilities alive harley had to remain in harmony with marlborough the general s popularity with the soldiers and the european powers and france s awe of his military prowess necessitated the appearance that marlborough s command was secure while the examiner with its tory audience and its emphasis on pressure for peace was essential to harley so were swift s and defoe s appeals for moderation at a time when sympathy for marlborough was rampant and the call no peace without spain was still defended even by the october club for the same reasons he was glad to have bolingbroke openly associated with the examiner january of brought the decisive defeat at brihuega which effectively took the issue of spanish succession away in the ensuing witch hunt almanza and the peace talks of were revived to distract the people while these inquiries proceeded england received word that france was ready to discuss terms the delay between this february and france s formal proposal may was an anxious time for harley and his schemers defoe was busy setting the stage for the outcome while swift the high tory could easily set about discrediting marlborough the hero and standard bearer and by so doing weaken the whig s position defoe s readers required different handling his most effective writing at this time was in pamphlets which reached a wider audience and which were not bound by the consistency of the review defoe and swift primed with the minister s inside knowledge set about to discredit the whig ministry in basically the same way in the february examiner swift wrote no body that i know of did ever dispute the duke of marlborough s courage conduct or success they have been always unquestionable and will continue to be so in spight of the malice of his enemies or which is yet more the weakness of his advocates the nation only wished to see him taken out of ill hands and put into better but what is all this to the conduct of the late ministry the shameful mismanagements in spain or the wrong steps in the treaty of peace defoe remarks our general wants neither conduct or courage and describes his greatest successes as daughters to preserve his memory while dissociating him somewhat from the jacobites whigs and business of making peace and war when the review finally discusses marlborough s fall defoe suggests that the greatest guilt is the error in policy and prudence among his friends both writers presented the duke as a means to an end and discredited him on personal grounds avarice ambition thereby protecting the military hero and the newborn glory of england fathered by his victories faced with dissenters and moderate whig readers defoe s review had to seem to oppose swift s examiner with its sneers at trade not only must it be consistent but it was obliged to shift its readers attention more slowly to the earlier failures of the whig ministry and the rich commercial advantages gained in the separate peace the life of marlborough is part of a stream of pamphlets which defoe wrote supporting the harley administration a supplement to the faults on both sides a discussion of the sacheverell case by two displac d officers of state rogues on both sides a study in contrasts between old and new whigs and old high flyer and new tories and a seasonable caution to the general assembly were published immediately before and after that same year his pamphlets discuss the october club the spanish succession mr harley and the state of religion by summer when the peace was nearly assured though still secret defoe was writing reasons for a peace or the war at an end taken in chronological order defoe s pamphlets indicate two emerging directions first the reasons for ending the war become more positive and entirely unconcerned with the general and second defoe s comments about the duke become less wholeheartedly admiring especially in no queen or no general rogues on both sides is witty praise for moderate men who act according to english principles of law and liberty regardless of people and party rather than believing any demagogue who cries it rains butter d turnips after this the pamphlets become more informative and solemn defoe demonstrates whigs and tories want the same things and that the country bleeds to death armageddon or the necessity of carrying on the war october reasons why this nation ought to put a speedy end to this expensive war october and reasons for a peace or the war at an end for example catalog the economic ailments taxes pirates hard to replace sailors and soldiers killed but far worse a decline in trade resulting in closed shops and declining manufacturing increasing unemployment the whole kingdom sold to usury and consumption of the growth of the country as the year passed defoe mentioned marlborough less and less but the general s

long night of forgetfulness it was in this scene of strife and bloodshed that the incidents we shall attempt to relate occurred during the third year of the war which england and france last waged for the possession of a country that neither was destined to retain the imbecility of her military leaders abroad and the fatal want of energy in her councils at home had lowered the character of great britain from the proud elevation on which it had been placed by the talents and enterprise of her former warriors and statesmen no longer dreaded by her enemies her servants were fast losing the confidence of self respect in this mortifying abasement the colonists though innocent of her imbecility and too humble to be the agents of her blunders were but the natural participators they had recently seen a chosen army from that country which reverencing as a mother they had blindly believed invincible an army led by a chief who had been selected from a crowd of trained warriors for his rare military endowments disgracefully routed by a handful of french and indians and only saved from annihilation by the coolness and spirit of a virginian boy whose riper fame has since diffused itself with the steady influence of moral truth to the uttermost confines of christendom a wide frontier had been laid naked by this unexpected disaster and more substantial evils were preceded by a thousand fanciful and imaginary dangers the alarmed colonists believed that the yells of the savages mingled with every fitful gust of wind that issued from the interminable forests of the west the terrific character of their merciless enemies increased immeasurably the natural horrors of warfare numberless recent massacres were still vivid in their recollections nor was there any ear in the provinces so deaf as not to have drunk in with avidity the narrative of some fearful tale of midnight murder in which the natives of the forests were the principal and barbarous actors as the credulous and excited traveller related the hazardous chances of the wilderness the blood of the timid curdled with terror and mothers cast anxious glances even at those children which slumbered within the security of the largest towns in short the magnifying influence of fear began to set at naught the calculations of reason and to render those who should have remembered their manhood the slaves of the basest of passions even the most confident and the stoutest hearts began to think the issue of the contest was becoming doubtful and that abject class was hourly increasing in numbers who thought they foresaw all the possessions of the english crown in america subdued by their christian foes or laid waste by the inroads of their relentless allies when therefore intelligence was received at the fort which covered the southern termination of the portage between the hudson and the lakes that montcalm had been seen moving up the champlain with an army numerous as the leaves on the trees its truth was admitted with more of the craven reluctance of fear than with the stern joy that a warrior should feel in finding an enemy within reach of his blow the news had been brought towards the decline of a day in midsummer by an indian runner who also bore an urgent request from munro the commander of a work on the shore of the holy lake for a speedy and powerful reinforcement it has already been mentioned that the distance between these two posts was less than five leagues the rude path which originally formed their line of communication had been widened for the passage of wagons so that the distance which had been travelled by the son of the forest in two hours might easily be effected by a detachment of troops with their necessary baggage between the rising and setting of a summer sun the loyal servants of the british crown had given to one of these forest fastnesses the name of william henry and to the other that of fort edward calling each after a favorite prince of the reigning family the veteran scotchman just named held the first with a regiment of regulars and a few provincials a force really by far too small to make head against the formidable power that montcalm was leading to the foot of his earthen mounds at the latter however lay general webb who commanded the armies of the king in the northern provinces with a body of more than five thousand men by uniting the several detachments of his command this officer might have arrayed nearly double that number of combatants against the enterprising frenchman who had ventured so far from his reinforcements with an army but little superior in numbers but under the influence of their degraded fortunes both officers and men appeared better disposed to await the approach of their formidable antagonists within their works than to resist the progress of their march by emulating the successful example of the french at fort du quesne and striking a blow on their advance after the first surprise of the intelligence had a little abated a rumor was spread through the entrenched camp which stretched along the margin of the hudson forming a chain of outworks to the body of the fort itself that a chosen detachment of fifteen hundred men was to depart with the dawn for william henry the post at the northern extremity of the portage that which at first was only rumor soon became

artist who sees the broad effect of a picture at a glance and then fills in the minute details he was already busy elaborating his scheme the goddess must be beautiful not too young reason can only go hand in hand with the riper age of second youth she must be decked out in classical draperies severe yet suggestive she must be rouged and painted for she is a mere idol easily to be appeased with incense music and laughter he was getting deeply interested in his subject seeking minutiae of detail with which to render his theme more and more attractive but patience was never the characteristic of the revolutionary government of france the national assembly soon tired of chaumette s dithyrambic utterances up aloft on the mountain danton was yawning like a gigantic leopard soon henriot was on his feet he had a far finer scheme than that of the procureur to place before his colleagues a grand national fete semi religious in character but of the new religion which destroyed and desecrated and never knelt in worship citizen chaumette s goddess of reason by all means henriot conceded that the idea was a good one but the goddess merely as a figure head around her a procession of unfrocked and apostate priests typifying the destruction of ancient hierarchy mules carrying loads of sacred vessels the spoils of ten thousand churches of france and ballet girls in bacchanalian robes dancing the carmagnole around the new deity public prosecutor foucquier tinville thought all these schemes very tame why should the people of france be led to think that the era of a new religion would mean an era of milk and water of pageants and of fireworks let every man woman and child know that this was an era of blood and again of blood oh he exclaimed in passionate accents would that all the traitors in france had but one head that it might be cut off with one blow of the guillotine he approved of the national fete but he desired an apotheosis of the guillotine he undertook to find ten thousand traitors to be beheaded on one grand and glorious day ten thousand heads to adorn the place de la revolution on a great never to be forgotten evening after the guillotine had accomplished this record work but collot d herbois would also have his say collot lately hailed from the south with a reputation for ferocity unparalleled throughout the whole of this horrible decade he would not be outdone by tinville s bloodthirsty schemes he was the inventor of the noyades which had been so successful at lyons and marseilles why not give the inhabitants of paris one of these exhilarating spectacles he asked with a coarse brutal laugh then he explained his invention of which he was inordinately proud some two or three hundred traitors men women and children tied securely together with ropes in great human bundles and thrown upon a barge in the middle of the river the barge with a hole in her bottom not too large only sufficient to cause her to sink slowly very slowly in sight of the crowd of delighted spectators the cries of the women and children and even of the men as they felt the waters rising and gradually enveloping them as they felt themselves powerless even for a fruitless struggle had proved most exhilarating so citizen collot declared to the hearts of the true patriots of lyons thus the discussion continued this was the era when every man had but one desire that of outdoing others in ferocity and brutality and but one care that of saving his own head by threatening that of his neighbour the great duel between the titanic leaders of these turbulent parties the conflict between hot headed danton on the one side and cold blooded robespierre on the other had only just begun the great all devouring monsters had dug their claws into one another but the issue of the combat was still at stake neither of these two giants had taken part in these deliberations anent the new religion and the new goddess danton gave signs now and then of the greatest impatience and muttered something about a new form of tyranny a new kind of oppression on the left robespierre in immaculate sea green coat and carefully gauffered linen was quietly polishing the nails of his right hand against the palm of his left but nothing escaped him of what was going on his ferocious egoism his unbounded ambition was even now calculating what advantages to himself might accrue from this idea of the new religion and of the national fete what personal aggrandisement he could derive therefrom the matter outwardly seemed trivial enough but already his keen and

the king to consent to a bill for triennial parliaments when swift took up his residence at moor park he found there a little girl of eight daughter of a merchant named edward johnson who had died young swift says that esther johnson was born on march in the parish register of richmond which shows that she was baptized on march her name is given as hester but she signed her will esther the name by which she was always known swift says her father was a younger brother of a good family in nottinghamshire her mother of a lower degree and indeed she had little to boast in her birth mrs johnson had two children esther and ann and lived at moor park as companion to lady giffard temple s widowed sister another member of the household afterwards to be esther s constant companion was rebecca dingley a relative of the temple family she was a year or two older than swift the lonely young man of twenty two was both playfellow and teacher of the delicate child of eight how he taught her to write has been charmingly brought before us in the painting exhibited by miss dicksee at the royal academy a few years ago he advised her what books to read and instructed her as he says in the principles of honour and virtue from which she never swerved in any one action or moment of her life by swift had grown tired of his position and finding that temple who valued his services was slow in finding him preferment he left moor park in order to carry out his resolve to go into the church he was ordained and obtained the prebend of kilroot near belfast where he carried on a flirtation with a miss waring whom he called varina but in may temple made proposals which induced swift to return to moor park where he was employed in preparing temple s memoirs and correspondence for publication and in supporting the side taken by temple in the letters of phalaris controversy by writing the battle of the books which was however not published until on his return to temple s house swift found his old playmate grown from a sickly child into a girl of fifteen in perfect health she came he says to be looked upon as one of the most beautiful graceful and agreeable young women in london only a little too fat her hair was blacker than a raven and every feature of her face in perfection on his death in january temple left a will dated directing the payment of pounds each with half a year s wages to bridget johnson and all my other servants and leaving a lease of some land in monistown county wicklow to esther johnson servant to my sister giffard by a codicil of february temple left pounds to mr jonathan swift now living with me it may be added that by her will of proved in the following year lady giffard gave pounds to mrs moss mrs bridget johnson who had married richard mose or moss lady giffard s steward the will proceeds to mrs hester sic johnson i give pounds with the pounds i put into the exchequer for her life and my own and declare the pounds to be hers which i am told is there in my name upon the survivorship and for which she has constantly sent over her certificate and received the interest i give her besides my two little silver candlesticks temple left in swift s hands the task of publishing his posthumous works a duty which afterwards led to a quarrel with lady giffard and other members of the family many years later swift told lord palmerston that he stopped at moor park solely for the benefit of temple s conversation and advice and the opportunity of pursuing his studies at temple s death he was as far to seek as ever in the summer of however he was offered and accepted the post of secretary and chaplain to the earl of berkeley one of the lords justices but when he reached ireland he found that the secretaryship had been given to another he soon however obtained the living of laracor agher and rathbeggan and the prebend of dunlavin in st patrick s cathedral dublin the total value of these preferments was about pounds a year an income which miss waring seems to have thought enough to justify him in marrying swift s reply to the lady whom he had singled out at first from the rest of women could only have been written with the intention of breaking off the connection and accordingly we hear no more of poor varina at laracor a mile or two from trim and twenty miles from dublin swift ministered to a congregation of about fifteen persons and had abundant leisure for cultivating his garden making a canal after the dutch fashion of moor park planting willows and rebuilding the vicarage as chaplain to lord berkeley he spent much of his time in dublin he was on intimate terms with lady berkeley and her daughters one of whom is best known by her married name of lady betty germaine and through them he had access to the fashionable society of dublin when lord berkeley returned to england in april swift after taking his doctor s degree at dublin went with him and soon afterwards published anonymously a political pamphlet a discourse on the contests and dissentions in athens and rome when he returned to ireland in september he was accompanied by stella to give esther johnson the name by which she is best known and her friend mrs dingley stella s fortune was about pounds and the property temple had left her was in county wicklow swift very much for his own satisfaction who had few friends or acquaintance in ireland persuaded stella now twenty years old that living was cheaper there than in england and that a better return was obtainable on money the ladies took his advice and made ireland their home at first they felt themselves strangers in dublin the adventure looked so like a frolic

'Whereinthemonth,anddayofthemontharesetdown,thepersonsnamed,', 'andthegreatactionsandeventsofnextyearparticularly']",1,and i beg the reader will compare their manner with mine and here i make bold to tell the world that i lay the whole credit of my art upon the truth of these predictions and i will be content that partridge and the rest of his clan may hoot me for a cheat and impostor if i fail in any singular particular of moment i believe any man who reads this paper will look upon me to be at least a person of as much honesty and understanding as a common maker of almanacks i do not lurk in the dark i am not wholly unknown in the world i have set my name at length to be a mark of infamy to mankind if they shall find i deceive them in one thing i must desire to be forgiven that i talk more sparingly of home affairs as it will be imprudence to discover secrets of state so it would be dangerous to my person but in smaller matters and that are not of publick consequence i shall be very free and the truth of my conjectures will as much appear from those as the other as for the most signal events abroad in france flanders italy and spain i shall make no scruple to predict them in plain terms some of them are of importance and i hope i shall seldom mistake the day they will happen therefore i think good to inform the reader that i all along make use of the old style observed in england which i desire he will compare with that of the news papers at the time they relate the actions i mention i must add one word more i know it hath been the opinion of several of the learned who think well enough of the true art of astrology that the stars do only incline and not force the actions or wills of men and therefore however i may proceed by right rules yet i cannot in prudence so confidently assure the events will follow exactly as i predict them i hope i have maturely considered this objection which in some cases is of no little weight for example a man may by the influence of an over ruling planet be disposed or inclined to lust rage or avarice and yet by the force of reason overcome that bad influence and this was the case of socrates but as the great events of the world usually depend upon numbers of men it cannot be expected they should all unite to cross their inclinations from pursuing a general design wherein they unanimously agree besides the influence of the stars reaches to many actions and events which are not any way in the power of reason as sickness death and what we commonly call accidents with many more needless to repeat but now it is time to proceed to my predictions which i have begun to calculate from the time that the sun enters into aries and this i take to be properly the beginning of the natural year i pursue them to the time that he enters libra or somewhat more which is the busy period of the year the remainder i have not yet adjusted upon account of several impediments needless here to mention besides i must remind the reader again that this is but a specimen of what i design in succeeding years to treat more at large if i may have liberty and encouragement my first prediction is but a trifle yet i will mention it to show how ignorant those sottish pretenders to astrology are in their own concerns it relates to partridge the almanack maker i have consulted the stars of his nativity by my own rules and find he will infallibly die upon the th of march next about eleven at night of a raging fever therefore i advise him to consider of it and settle his affairs in time the month of april will be observable for the death of many great persons on the th will die the cardinal de noailles archbishop of paris on the th the young prince of asturias son to the duke of anjou on the th a great peer of this realm

the present cessation of party arms will not hold long these are some of the reasons why i think this is the proper juncture for me to give some account of myself and of my past conduct to the world and that i may do this as effectually as i can being perhaps never more to speak from the press i shall as concisely as i can give an abridgment of my own history during the few unhappy years i have employed myself or been employed in public in the world misfortunes in business having unhinged me from matters of trade it was about the year when i was invited by some merchants with whom i had corresponded abroad and some also at home to settle at cadiz in spain and that with offers of very good commissions but providence which had other work for me to do placed a secret aversion in my mind to quitting england upon any account and made me refuse the best offers of that kind to be concerned with some eminent persons at home in proposing ways and means to the government for raising money to supply the occasions of the war then newly begun some time after this i was without the least application of mine and being then seventy miles from london sent for to be accountant to the commissioners of the glass duty in which service i continued to the determination of their commission during this time there came out a vile abhorred pamphlet in very ill verse written by one mr tutchin and called the foreigners in which the author who he was i then knew not fell personally upon the king himself and then upon the dutch nation and after having reproached his majesty with crimes that his worst enemy could not think of without horror he sums up all in the odious name of foreigner this filled me with a kind of rage against the book and gave birth to a trifle which i never could hope should have met with so general an acceptation as it did i mean the true born englishman how this poem was the occasion of my being known to his majesty how i was afterwards received by him how employed and how above my capacity of deserving rewarded is no part of the present case and is only mentioned here as i take all occasions to do for the expressing the honour i ever preserved for the immortal and glorious memory of that greatest and best of princes and whom it was my honour and advantage to call master as well as sovereign whose goodness to me i never forgot neither can forget and whose memory i never patiently heard abused nor ever can do so and who had he lived would never have suffered me to be treated as i have been in the world but heaven for our sins removed him in judgment how far the treatment he met with from the nation he came to save and whose deliverance he finished was admitted by heaven to be a means of his death i desire to forget for their sakes who are guilty and if this calls any of it to mind it is mentioned to move them to treat him better who is now with like principles of goodness and clemency appointed by god and the constitution to be their sovereign lest he that protects righteous princes avenge the injuries they receive from an ungrateful people by giving them up to the confusions their madness leads them to and in their just acclamations at the happy accession of his present majesty to the throne i cannot but advise them to look back and call to mind who it was that first guided them to the family of hanover and to pass by all the popish branches of orleans and savoy recognising the just authority of parliament in the undoubted right of limiting the succession and establishing that glorious maxim of our settlement viz that it is inconsistent with the constitution of this protestant kingdom to be governed by a popish prince i say let them call to mind who it was that guided their thoughts first to the protestant race of our own kings in the house of hanover and that it is to king william next to heaven itself to whom we owe the enjoying a protestant king at this time i need not go back to the particulars of his majesty s conduct in that affair his journey in person to the country of hanover and the court of zell his particular management of the affair afterwards at home perfecting the design by naming the illustrious family to the nation and bringing about a parliamentary settlement to effect it entailing the crown thereby in so effectual a manner as we see has been sufficient to prevent the worst designs of our jacobite people in behalf of the pretender a settlement together with the subsequent acts which followed it and the union with scotland which made it unalterable that gave a complete satisfaction to those who knew and understood it and removed those terrible apprehensions of the pretender which some entertained from the minds of others who were yet as zealous against him as it was possible for any to be upon this settlement as i shall show presently i grounded my opinion which i often expressed viz that i did not see it possible the jacobites could ever set up their idol here and i think my opinion abundantly justified in the consequences of which by and by this digression as a debt to the glorious memory of king william i could not in justice omit and as the reign of his present majesty is esteemed happy and looked upon as a blessing from heaven by us it will most necessarily lead us to bless the memory of king william to whom we owe so much of it how easily could his majesty have led us to other branches whose relation to the crown might have had large pretences what prince but would have submitted to have educated a successor of his race in the protestant religion for the sake of such a crown but the king who had our happiness in view and saw as far into it as any human sight could penetrate who knew we were not to be governed by

them that were lost he is the physician of value that was wounded to heal our wounds he was wounded for our transgressions bruised for our iniquities and had the chastisement of our peace upon him that by his stripes we might be healed it is he alone that could do this who is sufficient for these things the lord found out one that is sufficient he hath laid help upon one that is mighty that is able to save to the uttermost all that come unto god by him god hath given him the spirit without measure and filled him with grace and truth that of his fullness we might all receive and grace for grace he is mighty to save the sons and daughters of men and to give them power to become the children of god this was testified of old john i but as many as received him to them gave he power to become the sons of god even to them who believe on his name men want power over their sins when sin appears to be exceeding sinful they would overcome it and be rid of it when it is troublesome and when they are under a deep conviction of the evil of it and see the woful and miserable state that sin hath brought mankind into how they have lost the image of god and the favour of god they then

answer god s call and believe in the son of god and in his inward appearance that obey his voice when they hear his call saying come away come out of thy sins come out of the wickedness filthiness and pollution of the world come into the divine nature of the son of god come into his life into what life into the spiritual life the divine life thou hast been dead to god and alive to the world now

and salvation and receive power to overcome thy sins then thou wilt be a conqueror and overcome the devil we are of ourselves altogether insufficient for these things we are weak and impotent and our saviour hath told us without me ye can do nothing we are justified freely by god s grace through the redemption that is in jesus christ not justified by our own works how great a contradiction is it to charge them with the contrary that say they cannot preach nor pray but as the spirit of god moveth them blessed be god that hath made us sensible of our own weakness emptiness and poverty our help hath been in the name of the lord who made heaven and earth who hath given his son to be an helper and an all sufficient saviour to us with him he hath given sufficient power and strength whereby we are enabled to overcome the devil the enemy of our souls so that we may be enabled to stand against principalities and powers against spiritual wickedness and conquer all the powers of darkness and fight the good fight of faith and finish our course with joy and keep the faith seeing there is laid up for us a crown of righteousness which the lord the righteous judge shall give us at that day and not only to us saith the apostle but unto all them that love his appearing we have not an high priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities but was in all points tempted like as we are yet without sin christ our redeemer was tempted that he might succour those that are tempted when the devil tempted our saviour in the wilderness and could not prevail he went away and left him the prince of this world found nothing in him upon which he could fasten his temptation christ will enable those that believe in him to overcome the devil and to be more than conquerors through him that loved them he came into the world to purge and purify his people and to be the author of eternal salvation to all them that believe in him and obey him but it is said he did not many mighty works among some to whom he preached the everlasting gospel because of their unbelief many will not believe in the inward and spiritual appearance of jesus christ the son of god who is the light of the world they will neither believe in the light nor walk in the light which will enable them to conquer the evil one who is the prince of darkness it is only through christ jesus the great captain of our salvation that we are victorious therefore my friends open your hearts to the lord jesus christ receive this blessed gift of god which he offers to you and can god give you a greater gift than the son

whose silly speculations and absurd paradoxes are not worthy the attention of any reasonable man the advocate for the perfectibility of man and of society retorts on the defender of establishments a more than equal contempt he brands him as the slave of the most miserable and narrow prejudices or as the defender of the abuses of civil society only because he profits by them he paints him either as a character who prostitutes his understanding to his interest or as one whose powers of mind are not of a size to grasp any thing great and noble who cannot see above five yards before him and who must therefore be utterly unable to take in the views of the enlightened benefactor of mankind in this unamicable contest the cause of truth cannot but suffer the really good arguments on each side of the question are not allowed to have their proper weight each pursues his own theory little solicitous to correct or improve it by an attention to what is advanced by his opponents the friend of the present order of things condemns all political speculations in the gross he will not even condescend to examine the grounds from which the perfectibility of society is inferred much less will he give himself the trouble in a fair and candid manner to attempt an exposition of their fallacy the speculative philosopher equally offends against the cause of truth with eyes fixed on a happier state of society the blessings of which he paints in the most captivating colours he allows himself to indulge in the most bitter invectives against every present establishment without applying his talents to consider the best and safest means of removing abuses and without seeming to be aware of the tremendous obstacles that threaten even in theory to oppose the progress of man towards perfection it is an acknowledged truth in philosophy that a just theory will always be confirmed by experiment yet so much friction and so many minute circumstances occur in practice which it is next to impossible for the most enlarged and penetrating mind to foresee that on few subjects can any theory be pronounced just till all the arguments against it have been maturely weighed and clearly and consistently refuted i have read some of the speculations on the perfectibility of man and of society with great pleasure i have been warmed and delighted with the enchanting picture which they hold forth i ardently wish for such happy improvements but i see great and to my understanding unconquerable difficulties in the way to them these difficulties it is my present purpose to state declaring at the same time that so far from exulting in them as a cause of triumph over the friends of innovation nothing would give me greater pleasure than to see them completely removed the most important argument that i shall adduce is certainly not new the principles on which it depends have been explained in part by hume and more at large by dr adam smith it has been advanced and applied to the present subject though not with its proper weight or in the most forcible point of view by mr wallace and it may probably have been stated by many writers that i have never met with i should certainly therefore not think of advancing it again though i mean to place it in a point of view in some degree different from any that i have hitherto seen if it had ever been fairly and satisfactorily answered the cause of this neglect on the part of the advocates for the perfectibility of mankind is not easily accounted for i cannot doubt the talents of such men as godwin and condorcet i am unwilling to doubt their candour to my understanding and probably to that of most others the difficulty appears insurmountable yet these men of acknowledged ability and penetration scarcely deign to notice it and hold on their course in such speculations with unabated ardour and undiminished confidence i have certainly no right to say that they purposely shut their eyes to such arguments i ought rather to doubt the validity of them when neglected by such men however forcibly their truth may strike my own mind yet in this respect it must be acknowledged that we are all of us too prone to err if i saw a glass of wine repeatedly presented to a man and he took no notice of it i should be apt to think that he was blind or uncivil a juster philosophy might teach me rather to think that my eyes deceived me and that the offer was not really what i conceived it to be in entering upon the argument i must premise that i put out of the question at present all mere conjectures that is all suppositions the probable realization of which cannot be inferred upon any just philosophical grounds a writer may tell me that he thinks man will ultimately become an ostrich i cannot properly contradict him but before he can expect to bring any reasonable person over to his opinion he ought to shew that the necks of mankind have been gradually elongating that the lips have grown harder and more prominent that the legs and feet are daily altering their shape and that the hair is beginning to change into stubs of feathers and till the probability of so wonderful a conversion can be shewn it is surely lost time and lost eloquence to expatiate on the happiness of man in such a state to describe his powers both of running and flying to paint him in a condition where all narrow luxuries would be contemned where he would be employed only in collecting the necessaries of life and where consequently each man s share of labour would be light and his portion of leisure ample i think i may fairly make two postulata first that food is necessary to the existence of man secondly that the passion between the sexes is necessary and will remain nearly in its present state these two laws ever

put us into an imperfect state where we have perpetual occasion of each other s assistance there is none so low as not to be in a capacity of assisting the highest nor so high as not to want the assistance of the lowest it plainly appears from what hath been said that no one human creature is more worthy than another in the sight of god further than according to the goodness or holiness of their lives and that power wealth and the like outward advantages are so far from being the marks of god s approving or preferring those on whom they are bestowed that on the contrary he is pleased to suffer them to be almost engrossed by those who have least title to his favour now according to this equality wherein god hath placed all mankind with relation to himself you will observe that in all the relations between man and man there is a mutual dependence whereby the one cannot subsist without the other thus no man can be a prince without subjects nor a master without servants nor a father without children and this both explains and confirms the doctrine of the text for where there is a mutual dependence there must be a mutual duty and consequently a mutual subjection for instance the subject must obey his prince because god commands it human laws require it and the safety of the public makes it necessary for the same reasons we must obey all that are in authority and submit ourselves not only to the good and gentle but also to the froward whether they rule according to our liking or not on the other side in those countries that pretend to freedom princes are subject to those laws which their people have chosen they are bound to protect their subjects in liberty property and religion to receive their petitions and redress their grievances so that the best prince is in the opinion of wise men only the greatest servant of the nation not only a servant to the public in general but in some sort to every man in it in the like manner a servant owes obedience and diligence and faithfulness to his master from whom at the same time he hath a just demand for protection and maintenance and gentle treatment nay even the poor beggar hath a just demand of an alms from the rich man who is guilty of fraud injustice and oppression if he does not afford relief according to his abilities but this subjection we all owe one another is nowhere more necessary than in the common conversations of life for without it there could be no society among men if the learned would not sometimes submit to the ignorant the wise to the simple the gentle to the froward the old to the weaknesses of the young there would be nothing but everlasting variance in the world this our saviour himself confirmed by his own example for he appeared in the form of a servant and washed his disciples feet adding those memorable words ye call me lord and master and ye say well for so i am if i then your lord and master wash your feet how much more ought ye to wash one another s feet under which expression of washing the feet is included all that subjection assistance love and duty which every good christian ought to pay his brother in whatever station god hath placed him for the greatest prince and the meanest slave are not by infinite degrees so distant as our saviour and those disciples whose feet he vouchsafed to wash and although this doctrine of subjecting ourselves to one another may seem to grate upon the pride and vanity of mankind and may therefore be hard to be digested by those who value themselves upon their greatness or their wealth yet it is really no more than what most men practise upon other occasions for if our neighbour who is our inferior comes to see us we rise to receive him we place him above us and respect him as if he were better than ourselves and this is thought both decent and necessary and is usually called good manners now the duty required by the apostle is only that we should enlarge our minds and that what we thus practise in the common course of life we should imitate in all our actions and proceedings whatsoever since our saviour tells us that every man is our neighbour and since we are so ready in point of civility to yield to others in our own houses where only we have any title to govern having thus shown you what sort of subjection it is which all men owe one another and in what manner it ought to be paid i shall now draw some observations from what hath been said and first a thorough practice of this duty of subjecting ourselves to the wants and infirmities of each other would utterly extinguish in us the vice of pride for if god has pleased to intrust me with a talent not for my own sake but for the service of others and at the same time hath left me full of wants and necessities which others must supply i can then have no cause to set any extraordinary value upon myself or to despise my brother because he hath not the same talents which were lent to me his being may probably be as useful to the public as mine and therefore by the rules of right reason i am in no sort preferable to him secondly it is very manifest from what has been said that no man ought to look upon the advantages of life such as riches honour power and the like as his property but merely as a trust which god hath deposited with him to be employed for the use of his brethren and god will certainly punish the breach of that trust though the laws of man will not or rather indeed cannot because the trust was conferred only by god who has not left it to any power on earth to decide infallibly whether a man makes a good use of his talents or not or to punish him where he fails and therefore god seems to have more particularly taken this matter into his own hands and will most certainly reward or punish

means and then those words are nothing less than an application to the devil mr aubrey of the royal society says a gentlewoman that he knew confessed in his hearing that she used this method and

things as infirmities and frailties peculiar to your sex no men and great men too and scholars and even statesmen and princes themselves have been tainted with superstitions and where they infect the minds of such great personages they make the deeper impression according to the stronger and more manly ideas they have of them their greater degree of strength in the intellect only subjects them to greater weaknesses such was even the great paracelsus the wonder and miracle of learning in the age wherein he lived and such were all his followers scholars statesmen divines and princes that are talismanists these talismans that paracelsus pretends to owe to the excogitation and invention of honest art seem to me to be of a very diabolical nature and to owe their rise to being dedicated by the author to the heathen gods thus the cabalists pretending to a vast penetration into arts and sciences though all their thoughts are chimeras and extravagancies unless they be helped by preternatural means say they have found out the several methods appropriated to the several planets they have appropriated gold to the sun on the sunday silver to the moon on the monday iron to mars

year they set off early in september with never a thought that any danger might menace their dear ones after so many years of peace and comparative prosperity the children had work in plenty to keep them from idleness during the week of ten days their fathers might be absent and no sooner had the little vessel sailed out of the harbor than they set about their several tasks in order that all the labor might be performed by the time the fishermen returned mark and luke were engaged in setting up the flakes or framework on which the fish were to be dried and this labor was performed near the shore of the harbor quite beyond sight of the homesteads with the high palisade which last hid from view all save the roofs of the buildings the future hopes which was the name of the small vessel belonging to the settlers had left her moorings when the first gray light of the coming day could be seen stealing over the waters and while she was yet close in shore the two lads set about building the flakes counting on completing the task within three days and to that end working so industriously as to give little or no heed to what might be passing around them therefore it was that they failed to see a canoe in which were five indians come swiftly up from the southward past what is now known as pulpit rock and sail straight for the island at the mouth of the harbor which the people of to day call bar island here the frail craft was hidden from view of the boys and when half an hour or more had gone by another canoe this one carrying six men executed the same maneuver five minutes later a third craft appeared but just as she came in view past the rock luke stood erect to drive in one of the stakes and therefore saw the strangers as they were evidently trying to steal by without being seen more than once since luke could remember had mount desert been visited by red men of the abenakis tribe but the visitors had always approached boldly like friends and this skulking from rock to island seemed much like a show of enmity certain it is that the lad was alarmed but he understood from what his father had said many times that it was not wise to let the indians know of his fear and continuing at the labor he said in a low tone to mark don t raise your head nor look around a canoe filled with abenakis has sneaked in behind the harbor island can it be mischief is intended they may be after rock cod and count on coming ashore later mark replied continuing his work in such a fashion that he could look seaward without seeming to do so at this moment the occupants of the last canoe were moving around the point of the island as if to gain a position where a full view of the buildings might be had for there could be no possibility the visitors were engaged in fishing of any other such peaceful pursuit there s trouble of some kind and it s for us to find out what mark said in a whisper there must have been other canoes than the one you saw for i have already counted eleven men on the island and they could not all have come in a single boat the boys had had no experience fortunately for them in indian warfare but they had heard enough from their parents to be fully alive to the possibilities and after a few moments during which time fear had held them speechless mark said in a low tone although there was no chance the enemy could have heard him we must get over to the house without seeming to be running away you start first and when you go through the gate call out that mother wants to see me luke obeyed leisurely although his heart was beating so loudly and heavily that it seemed as if it could be heard a long distance away and arriving at the palisade he summoned his brother as had been proposed then it was that mark was at liberty to leave his work and he answered the summons more quickly perhaps than ever before in his life mistress pemberton was busily engaged inside the house and the other two children were in a small garden directly in the rear of the building therefore the boys were able to impart the disagreeable tidings without alarming those who could be of little or no assistance indians skulking on the harbor

luke cried it wasn t chance that brought them my son unless coming for some evil purpose they would have landed boldly as they have done so many times it must be that the painted wretches have been

these weeks although it was at a time of the year when usually the bills are very moderate the usual number of burials within the bills of mortality for a week was from about or thereabouts to the last was esteemed a pretty high bill but after this we found the bills successively increasing as follows buried increased december the th to the th th rd january january the rd th th th th th this last bill was really frightful being a higher number than had been known to have been buried in one week since the preceding visitation of however all this went off again and the weather proving cold and the frost which began in december still continuing very severe even till near the end of february attended with sharp though moderate winds the bills decreased again and the city grew healthy and everybody began to look upon the danger as good as over only that still the burials in st giles s continued high from the beginning of april especially they stood at twenty five each week till the week from the th to the th when there was buried in st giles s parish thirty whereof two of the plague and eight of the spotted fever which was looked upon as the same thing likewise the number that died of the spotted fever in the whole increased being eight the week before and twelve the week above named this alarmed us all again and terrible apprehensions were among the people especially the weather being now changed and growing warm and the summer being at hand however the next week there seemed to be some hopes again the bills were low the number of the dead in all was but there was none of the plague and but four of the spotted fever but the following week it returned again and the distemper was spread into two or three other parishes viz st andrew s holborn st clement danes and to the great affliction of the city one died within the walls in the parish of st mary woolchurch that is to say in bearbinder lane near stocks market in all there were nine of the plague and six of the spotted fever it was however upon inquiry found that this frenchman who died in bearbinder lane was one who having lived in long acre near the infected houses had removed for fear of the distemper not knowing that he was already infected this was the beginning of may yet the weather was temperate variable and cool enough and people had still some hopes that which encouraged them was that the city was healthy the whole ninety seven parishes buried but fifty four and we began to hope that as it was chiefly among the people at that end of the town it might go no farther and the rather because the next week which was from the th of may to the th there died but three of which not one within the whole city or liberties and st andrew s buried but fifteen which was very low tis true st giles s buried two and thirty but still as there was but one of the plague people began to be easy the whole bill also was very low for the week before the bill was but and the week above mentioned but we continued in these hopes for a few days but it was but for a few for the people were no more to be deceived thus they searched the houses and found that the plague was really spread every way and that many died of it every day so that now all our extenuations abated and it was no more to be concealed nay it quickly appeared that the infection had spread itself beyond all hopes of abatement that in the parish of st giles it was gotten into several streets and several families lay all sick together and accordingly in the weekly bill for the next week the thing began to show itself there was indeed but fourteen set down of the plague but this was all knavery and collusion for in st giles s parish they buried forty in all whereof it was certain most of them died of the plague though they were set down of other distempers and though the number of all the burials were not increased above thirty two and the whole bill being but yet there was fourteen of the spotted fever as well as fourteen of the plague and we took it for granted upon the whole that there were fifty died that week of the plague the next bill was from the rd of may to the th when the number of the plague was seventeen but the burials in st giles s were fifty three a frightful number of whom they set down but nine of the plague but on an examination more strictly by the justices of peace and at the lord mayor s request it was found there were twenty more who were really dead of the plague in that parish but had been set down of the spotted fever or other distempers besides others concealed but those were trifling things to what followed immediately after for now the weather set in hot and from the first week in june the infection spread in a dreadful manner and the bills rose high the articles of the fever spotted fever and teeth began to swell for all that could conceal their distempers did it to prevent their neighbours shunning and refusing to converse with them and also to prevent

ought to be directed and i shall derive great satisfaction from a cooperation with you in the pleasing though arduous task of insuring to our fellow citizens the blessings which they have a right to expect from a free efficient and equal government state of the union address george washington december fellow citizens of the senate and house of representatives in meeting you again i feel much satisfaction in being able to repeat my congratulations on the favorable prospects which continue to distinguish our public affairs the abundant fruits of another year have blessed our country with plenty and with the means of a flourishing commerce the progress of public credit is witnessed by a considerable rise of american stock abroad as well as at home and the revenues allotted for this and other national purposes have been productive beyond the calculations by which they were regulated this latter circumstance is the more pleasing as it is not only a proof of the fertility of our resources but as it assures us of a further increase of the national respectability and credit and let me add as it bears an honorable testimony to the patriotism and integrity of the mercantile and marine part of our citizens the punctuality of the former in discharging their engagements has been exemplary in conformity to the powers vested in me by acts of the last session a loan of florins toward which some provisional measures had previously taken place has been completed in holland as well the celerity with which it has been filled as the nature of the terms considering the more than ordinary demand for borrowing created by the situation of europe give a reasonable hope that the further execution of those powers may proceed with advantage and success the secretary of the treasury has my directions to communicate such further particulars as may be requisite for more precise information since your last sessions i have received communications by which it appears that the district of kentucky at present a part of virginia has concurred in certain propositions contained in a law of that state in consequence of which the district is to become a distinct member of the union in case the requisite sanction of congress be added for this sanction application is now made i shall cause the papers on this very transaction to be laid before you the liberality and harmony with which it has been conducted will be found to do great honor to both the parties and the sentiments of warm attachment to the union and its present government expressed by our fellow citizens of kentucky can not fail to add an affectionate concern for their particular welfare to the great national impressions under which you will decide on the case submitted to you it has been heretofore known to congress that frequent incursions have been made on our frontier settlements by certain banditti of indians from the northwest side of the ohio these with some of the tribes dwelling on and near the wabash have of late been particularly active in their depredations and being emboldened by the impunity of their crimes and aided by such parts of the neighboring tribes as could be seduced to join in their hostilities or afford them a retreat for their prisoners and plunder they have instead of listening to the humane invitations and overtures made on the part of the united states renewed their violences with fresh alacrity and greater effect the lives of a number of valuable citizens have thus been sacrificed and some of them under circumstances peculiarly shocking whilst others have been carried into a deplorable captivity these aggravated provocations rendered it essential to the safety of the western settlements that the aggressors should be made sensible that the government of the union is not less capable of punishing their crimes than it is disposed to respect their rights and reward their attachments as this object could not be effected by defensive measures it became necessary to put in force the act which empowers the president to call out the militia for the protection of the frontiers and i have accordingly authorized an expedition in which the regular troops in that quarter are combined with such drafts of militia as were deemed sufficient the event of the measure is yet unknown to me the secretary of war is directed to lay before you a statement of the information on which it is founded as well as an estimate of the expense with which it will be attended the disturbed situation of europe and particularly the critical posture of the great maritime powers whilst it ought to make us the more thankful for the general peace and security enjoyed by the united states reminds us at the same time of the circumspection with which it becomes us to preserve these blessings it requires also that we should not overlook the tendency of a war and even of preparations for a war among the nations most concerned in active commerce with this country to abridge the means and thereby at least enhance the price of transporting its valuable productions to their markets i recommend it to your serious reflections how far and in what mode it may be expedient to guard against embarrassments from these contingencies by such encouragements to our own navigation as will render our commerce and agriculture less dependent on foreign bottoms which may

burdened with double taxes and forbidden to acquire real estate all public careers were closed to them and their property and even their persons were in times of excitement at the mercy of informers in the last year of pope s life a proclamation was issued forbidding catholics to come within ten miles of london and pope himself in spite of his influential friends thought it wise to comply with this edict a fierce outburst of persecution often evokes in the persecuted some of the noblest qualities of human nature but a long continued and crushing tyranny that extends to all the details of daily life is only too likely to have the most unfortunate results on those who are subjected to it and as a matter of fact we find that the well to do catholics of pope s day lived in an atmosphere of disaffection political intrigue and evasion of the law most unfavorable for the development of that frank courageous and patriotic spirit for the lack of which pope himself has so often been made the object of reproach in a well known passage of the epistle to arbuthnot pope has spoken of his life as one long disease he was in fact a humpbacked dwarf not over four feet six inches in height with long spider like legs and arms he was subject to violent headaches and his face was lined and contracted with the marks of suffering in youth he so completely ruined his health by perpetual studies that his life was despaired of and only the most careful treatment saved him from an early death toward the close of his life he became so weak that he could neither dress nor undress without assistance he had to be laced up in stiff stays in order to sit erect and wore a fur doublet and three pairs of stockings to protect himself against the cold with these physical defects he had the extreme sensitiveness of mind that usually accompanies chronic ill health and this sensitiveness was outraged incessantly by the brutal customs of the age pope s enemies made as free with his person as with his poetry and there is little doubt that he felt the former attacks the more bitterly of the two dennis his first critic called him a short squab gentleman the very bow of the god of love his outward form is downright monkey a rival poet whom he had offended hung up a rod in a coffee house where men of letters resorted and threatened to whip pope like a naughty child if he showed his face there it is said though perhaps not on the best authority that when pope once forgot himself so far as to make love to lady mary wortley montague the lady s answer was a fit of immoderate laughter in an appendix to the dunciad pope collected some of the epithets with which his enemies had pelted him an ape an ass a frog a coward a fool a little abject thing he affected indeed to despise his assailants but there is only too good evidence that their poisoned arrows rankled in his heart richardson the painter found him one day reading the latest abusive pamphlet these things are my diversion said the poet striving to put the best face on it but as he read his friends saw his features writhen with anguish and prayed to be delivered from all such diversions as these pope s enemies and their savage abuse are mostly forgotten to day pope s furious retorts have been secured to immortality by his genius it would have been nobler no doubt to have answered by silence only but before one condemns pope it is only fair to realize the causes of his bitterness pope s education was short and irregular he was taught the rudiments of latin and greek by his family priest attended for a brief period a school in the country and another in london and at the early age of twelve left school altogether and settling down at his father s house in the country began to read to his heart s delight he roamed through the classic poets translating passages that pleased him went up for a time to london to get lessons in french and italian and above all read with eagerness and attention the works of older english poets spenser waller and dryden he had already it would seem determined to become a poet and his father delighted with the clever boy s talent used to set him topics force him to correct his verses over and over and finally when satisfied dismiss him with the praise these are good rhymes he wrote a comedy a tragedy an epic poem all of which he afterward destroyed and as he laughingly confessed in later years he thought himself the greatest genius that ever was pope was not alone however in holding a high opinion of his talents while still a boy in his teens he was taken up and patronized by a number of gentlemen trumbull walsh and cromwell all dabblers in poetry and criticism he was introduced to the dramatist wycherly nearly fifty years his senior and helped to polish some of the old man s verses his own works were passed about in manuscript from hand to hand till one of them came to the eyes of dryden s old publisher tonson tonson wrote pope a respectful letter asking for the honor of being allowed to publish them one may fancy the delight with which the sixteen year old boy received this offer it is a proof of pope s patience as well as his precocity that he delayed three years before accepting it it was not till that his first published verses the pastorals a fragment translated from homer and a modernized version of one of the canterbury tales appeared in tonson s miscellany with the publication of the pastorals pope embarked upon his life as a man of letters they seem to have brought him a certain recognition but hardly fame that he

the words be for the pretender and this can be no otherwise understood than to have a design however remote and upon whatever views to bring him in to possess the throne of these kingdoms the matter then being laid down thus as sincerely and plainly as possible we come to the question point blank and think it our duty to say with the greatest sincerity that we do not believe the ministry are in any kind or with any prospect near or remote acting for or with a design or view to bring in the pretender having granted this we must however to prevent any breaking in by way of cavil on one hand or triumph on the other subjoin immediately that we do not in the least grant by this that the protestant succession is in no danger even from several of the measures now taken in the world it is far from any reflection upon the ministry to say that however they may act upon a right sincere principle for the protestant succession in all they do which as above we profess to believe yet that many of the tools they make use of are of another make and have no edge to cut any other way no thoughts to move them towards any other end no other centre which they can have any tendency to that the pretender s interest is the magnet which draws them by its secret influence to point to him as their pole that they have their aim at his establishment here and own it to be their aim and as they are not shy to profess it among themselves so their conduct in many things makes it sufficiently public this is not meant as any reflection upon the ministry for making use of such men the late ministry did the same and every ministry will and must employ men sometimes not as they always join with them in their politic principles but as either the men are found useful in their several employments or as the ministry may be under other circumstances which makes it necessary to them to employ them nor as the review well enough observed does it follow that because the ministry have employed or joined with jacobites in the public affairs that therefore they must have done it with a jacobite principle but let the ministry employ these men by what necessity or upon what occasion they will though it may not follow that the ministry are therefore for the pretender yet it does not also follow that there is no danger of the protestant succession from the employing those sort of people for what if the queen should die the ministry it is hoped are established in the interest of their queen and country and therefore it has been argued that supposing the ministry had the pretender in their eye yet that it is irrational to suggest that they can have any such view during the life of her present majesty nay even those professed jacobites who we spoke of just now cannot be so ungrateful to think of deposing the queen who has been so bountiful so kind so exceeding good to them as in several cases to suffer them to be brought into the management of her own affairs when by their character they might have been thought dangerous even to her person thus winning and engaging them by her bounty and the confidence that has been placed in them not to attempt anything to her prejudice without the most monstrous ingratitude without flying in the face of all that sense of honour and obligation which it is possible for men of common sense to entertain and it can hardly be thought that even papists themselves under the highest possessions of their religious zeal can conquer the native aversions they must have to such abominable ingratitude or to think of bringing in the pretender upon this protestant nation even while the queen shall be on the throne but though this may and some doubt that also tie up their hands during the queen s life yet they themselves give us but small reason to expect anything from them afterward and it will be hard to find anybody to vouch for them then these very jacobites papists and professed enemies to the revolution may be supposed upon these pretensions to be quiet and offer no violence to the present establishment while her majesty has the possession and while that life lasts to which they are so much indebted for her royal goodness and clemency but what would they do if the queen should die come we next to the french king we are told that not the french king only but even the whole french nation are wonderfully forward to acknowledge the obligation they are under to the justice and favour which they have received from her majesty in the putting an end to the war a war which lay heavy upon them and threatened the very name of the french nation with ruin and much more threatened the glory of the french court and of their great monarch with an entire overthrow a total eclipse a war which by their own confession it was impossible for them long to have supported the expenses of and which by the great superiority of the allies became dreadful to them and that every campaign more than the other a war which they were in such pain to see the end of that they tried all the powers and courts in christendom who were the least neutral to engage a mediation in order to a treaty and all in vain and a war which if her majesty had not inclined to put an end to must have ended perhaps to the disadvantage and confusion of both france and spain if not of all christendom the obligations the french are under for the bringing this war to so just and honourable a conclusion are not at all concealed nay the french themselves have not been backward to make them public the declarations made by the french king of his

hath been in the name of the lord who made heaven and earth who hath given his son to be an helper and an all sufficient saviour to us with him he hath given sufficient power and strength whereby we are enabled to overcome the devil the enemy of our souls so that we may be enabled to stand against principalities and powers against spiritual wickedness and conquer all the powers of darkness and fight the good fight of faith and finish our course with joy and keep the faith seeing there is laid up for us a crown of righteousness which the lord the righteous judge shall give us at that day and

which is now the great road a little on this side the whalebone a place on the road so called because the rib bone of a great whale which was taken in the river thames the same year that oliver cromwell died was fixed there for a monument of that monstrous creature it being at first about eight and twenty feet long according to my first intention of effectually viewing the sea coast of these three counties i went from stratford to barking a large market town but chiefly inhabited by fishermen whose smacks ride in the thames at the mouth of their river from whence their fish is sent up to london to the market at billingsgate by small boats of which i shall speak by itself in my description of london one thing i cannot omit in the mention of these barking fisher smacks viz that one of those fishermen a very substantial and experienced man convinced me that all the pretences to bringing fish alive to london market from the north seas and other remote places on the coast of great britain by the new built sloops called fish pools have not been able to do anything but what their fishing smacks are able on the same occasion to perform these fishing smacks are very useful vessels to the public upon many occasions as particularly in time of war they are used as press smacks running to all the northern and western coasts to pick up seamen to man the navy when any expedition is at hand that requires a sudden equipment at other times being excellent sailors they are tenders to particular men of war and on an expedition they have been made use of as machines for the blowing up of fortified ports and havens as at calais st malo and other places this parish of barking is very large and by the improvement of lands taken in out of the thames and out of the river which runs by the town the tithes as the townsmen assured me are worth above pounds per annum including small tithes note this parish has two or three chapels of ease viz one at ilford and one on the side of hainault forest called new chapel sir thomas fanshaw of an ancient roman catholic family has a very good estate in this parish a little beyond the town on the road to dagenham stood a great house ancient and now almost fallen down where tradition says the gunpowder treason plot was at first contrived and that all the first consultations about it were held there this side of the county is rather rich in land than in inhabitants occasioned chiefly by the unhealthiness of the air for these low marsh grounds which with all the south side of the county have been saved out of the river thames and out of the sea where the river is wide enough to be called so begin here or rather begin at west ham by stratford and continue to extend themselves from hence eastward growing wider and wider till we come beyond tilbury when the flat country lies six seven or eight miles broad and is justly said to be both unhealthy and unpleasant however the lands are rich and as is observable it is very good farming in the marshes because the landlords let good pennyworths for it being a place where everybody cannot live those that venture it will have encouragement and indeed it is but reasonable they should several little observations i made in this part of the county of essex we saw passing from barking to dagenham the famous breach made by an inundation of the thames which was so great as that it laid near acres of land under water but which after near ten years lying under water and being several times blown up has been at last effectually stopped by the application of captain perry the gentleman who for several years had been employed in the czar of muscovy s works at veronitza on the river don this breach appeared now effectually made up and they assured us that the new work where the breach was is by much esteemed the strongest of all the sea walls in that level it was observable that great part of the lands in these levels especially those on this side east tilbury are held by the farmers cow keepers and grazing butchers who live in and near london and that they are generally stocked all the winter half year with large fat sheep viz lincolnshire and leicestershire wethers which they buy in smithfield in september and october when the lincolnshire and leicestershire graziers sell off their stock and are kept here till christmas or candlemas or thereabouts and though they are not made at all fatter here than they were when bought in yet the farmer or butcher finds very good advantage in it by the difference of the price of mutton between michaelmas when it is cheapest and candlemas when it is dearest this is what the butchers value themselves upon when they tell us at the market that it is right marsh mutton in the bottom of these marshes and close to the edge of the river stands the strong fortress of tilbury called tilbury fort which may justly be looked upon as the key of the river thames and consequently the key of the city of london it is a regular fortification the design of it was a pentagon but the water bastion as it would have been called was never built the plan was laid out by sir martin beckman chief engineer to king charles ii who also designed the works at sheerness the esplanade of the fort is very large and the bastions the largest of any in england th

a medium that a child just born will weigh pounds and in a solar year if tolerably nursed encreaseth to pounds i grant this food will be somewhat dear and therefore very proper for landlords who as they have already devoured most of the parents seem to have the best title to the children infant s flesh will be in season throughout the year but more plentiful in march and a little before and after for we are told by a grave author an eminent french physician that fish being a prolifick dyet there are more children born in roman catholick countries about nine months after lent the markets will be more glutted than usual because the number of popish infants is at least three to one in this kingdom and therefore it will have one other collateral advantage by lessening the number of papists among us i have already computed the charge of nursing a beggar s child in which list i reckon all cottagers labourers and four fifths of the farmers to be about two shillings per annum rags included and i believe no gentleman would repine to give ten shillings for the carcass of a good fat child which as i have said will make four dishes of excellent nutritive meat when he hath only some particular friend or his own family to dine with him thus the squire will learn to be a good landlord and grow popular among his tenants the mother will have eight shillings neat profit and be fit for work till she produces another child those who are more thrifty as i must confess the times require may flea the carcass the skin of which artificially dressed will make admirable gloves for ladies and summer boots for fine gentlemen as to our city of dublin shambles may be appointed for this purpose in the most convenient parts of it and butchers we may be assured will not be wanting although i rather recommend buying the children alive and dressing them hot from the knife as we do roasting pigs a very worthy person a true lover of his country and whose virtues i highly esteem was lately pleased in discoursing on this matter to offer a refinement upon my scheme he said that many gentlemen of this kingdom having of late destroyed their deer he conceived that the want of venison might be well supply d by the bodies of young lads and maidens not exceeding fourteen years of age nor under twelve so great a number of both sexes in every country being now ready to starve for want of work and service and these to be disposed of by their parents if alive or otherwise by their nearest relations but with due deference to so excellent a friend and so deserving a patriot i cannot be altogether in his sentiments for as to the males my american acquaintance assured me from frequent experience that their flesh was generally tough and lean like that of our school boys by continual exercise and their taste disagreeable and to fatten them would not answer the charge then as to the females it would i think with humble submission be a loss to the publick because they soon would become breeders themselves and besides it is not improbable that some scrupulous people might be apt to censure such a practice although indeed very unjustly as a little bordering upon cruelty which i confess hath always been with me the strongest objection against any project how well soever intended but in order to justify my friend he confessed that this expedient was put into his head by the famous salmanaazor a native of the island formosa who came from thence to london above twenty years ago and in conversation told my friend that in his country when any young person happened to be put to death the executioner sold the carcass to persons of quality as a prime dainty and that in his time the body of a plump girl of fifteen who was crucified for an attempt to poison the emperor was sold to his imperial majesty s prime minister of state and other great mandarins of the court in joints from the gibbet at four hundred crowns neither indeed can i deny that if the same use were made of several plump young girls in this town who without one single groat to their fortunes cannot stir abroad without a chair and appear at a play house and assemblies in foreign fineries which they never will pay for the kingdom would not be the worse some persons of a desponding spirit are in great concern about that vast number of poor people who are aged diseased or maimed and i have been desired to employ my thoughts what course may be taken to ease the nation of so grievous an incumbrance but i am not in the least pain upon that matter because it is very well known that they are every day dying and rotting by cold and famine and filth and vermin as fast as can be reasonably expected and as to the young labourers they are now in almost as hopeful a condition they cannot get work and consequently pine away from want of nourishment to a degree that if at any time they are accidentally hired to common labour they have not strength to perform it and thus the country and themselves are happily delivered from the evils to come i have too long digressed and therefore shall return to my subject i think the advantages by the proposal which i have made are obvious and many as well as of the highest importance for first as i have already observed it would greatly lessen the number of papists with whom we are yearly over run being the principal breeders of the nation as well as our most dangerous enemies and who stay at home on purpose with a design to deliver the kingdom to the pretender hoping to take their advantage by the absence of so many good protestants who have chosen rather to leave their country than stay at home and pay tithes against their conscience to an episcopal curate secondly the poorer tenants will have

here with their beer aboard them they ll have to go ashore again you have an uncommonly sober crew capt spike answered the young man with great calmness during the whole time i have been with them i have not seen a man among them the least in the wind well i hope it will turn out that i ve an uncommonly sober mate in the bargain drunkenness i abominate mr mulford and i can tell you short metre that i will not stand it may i inquire if you ever saw me the least in the world under the influence of liquor capt spike demanded the mate rather than asked with a very fixed meaning in his manner i

off on the young flood and that rose budd and the good lady her aunt take passage in her this v y ge is it possible that you have persuaded them into that at last exclaimed the handsome mate persuaded

to try the sea for her constitution rose budd has no more of a pulmonary constitution than i have myself interrupted the mate well that s as people fancy you must know mr mulford they ve got all sorts of diseases now a days and all sorts of cures for em one sort of a cure for consumption is what they tarm the hyder ally i think you must mean hydropathy sir well it s something of the sort no matter what but cold water is at the bottom of it and they do say it s a good remedy now rose s aunt thinks if cold water is what is wanted there is no place where it can be so plenty as out on the ocean sea air is good too and by taking a v y ge her niece will get both requisites together and cheap does rose budd think herself consumptive capt spike asked mulford with interest not she you know it will

the aunt the cunning thing knows all about it mulford almost nauseated the expression of his commander s countenance while spike uttered the last words at no time was that countenance very inviting the features being coarse and vulgar while the color of the entire face was of an ambiguous red in which liquor and the seasons would seem to be blended in very equal quantities such a countenance lighted up by a gleam of successful management not to say with hopes and wishes that it will hardly do to dwell on could not but be revolting to a youth of harry mulford s generous feelings and most of all to one who entertained the sentiments which he was quite conscious of entertaining for rose budd the young man made no reply but turned his face toward the water in order to conceal the expression of disgust that he was sensible must be strongly depicted on it the river as the well known arm of the sea in which the swash was lying is erroneously termed was just at that moment unusually clear of craft and not a sail larger than that of a boat was to be seen between the end of blackwell s island and corlaer s hook a distance of about a league this stagnation in the movement of the port at that particular point was owing to the state of wind and tide of the first there was little more than a southerly air while the last was about two thirds ebb nearly everything that was expected on that tide coast wise and by the way of the sound had already arrived and nothing could go eastward with that light breeze and under canvas until the flood made of course it was different with the steamers who were paddling about like so many ducks steering in all directions though mostly crossing and re crossing at the ferries just as mulford turned away from his commander however a large vessel of that class shoved her bows into the view doubling the hook and going eastward the first glance at this vessel sufficed to drive even rose budd momentarily out of the minds of both master and mate and to give a new current to their thoughts spike had been on the point of walking up the wharf but he now so far changed his purpose as actually to jump on board of the brig and spring up alongside of his mate on the taffrail in order to get a better look at the steamer mulford who loathed so much in his commander was actually glad of this spike s rare merit as a seaman forming a sort of attraction that held him as it might be against his own will bound to his service what will they do next harry exclaimed the master his manner and voice actually humanized in air and sound at least by this unexpected view of something new in his calling what will they do next i see no wheels sir nor any movement in the water astern as if she were a propeller returned the young man

long night of forgetfulness it was in this scene of strife and bloodshed that the incidents we shall attempt to relate occurred during the third year of the war which england and france last waged for the possession of a country that neither was destined to retain the imbecility of her military leaders abroad and the fatal want of energy in her councils at home had lowered the character of great britain from the proud elevation on which it had been placed by the talents and enterprise of her former warriors and statesmen no longer dreaded by her enemies her servants were fast losing the confidence of self respect in this mortifying abasement the colonists though innocent of her imbecility and too humble to be the agents of her blunders were but the natural participators they had recently seen a chosen army from that country which reverencing as a mother they had blindly believed invincible an army led by a chief who had been selected from a crowd of trained warriors for his rare military endowments disgracefully routed by a handful of french and indians and only saved from annihilation by the coolness and spirit of a virginian boy whose riper fame has since diffused itself with the steady influence of moral truth to the uttermost confines of christendom a wide frontier had been laid naked by this unexpected disaster and more substantial evils were preceded by a thousand fanciful and imaginary dangers the alarmed colonists believed that the yells of the savages mingled with every fitful gust of wind that issued from the interminable forests of the west the terrific character of their merciless enemies increased immeasurably the natural horrors of warfare numberless recent massacres were still vivid in their recollections nor was there any ear in the provinces so deaf as not to have drunk in with avidity the narrative of some fearful tale of midnight murder in which the natives of the forests were the principal and barbarous actors as the credulous and excited traveller related the hazardous chances of the wilderness the blood of the timid curdled with terror and mothers cast anxious glances even at those children which slumbered within the security of the largest towns in short the magnifying influence of fear began to set at naught the calculations of reason and to render those who should have remembered their manhood the slaves of the basest of passions even the most confident and the stoutest hearts began to think the issue of the contest was becoming doubtful and that abject class was hourly increasing in numbers who thought they foresaw all the possessions of the english crown in america subdued by their christian foes or laid waste by the inroads of their relentless allies when therefore intelligence was received at the fort which covered the southern termination of the portage between the hudson and the lakes that montcalm had been seen moving up the champlain with an army numerous as the leaves on the trees its truth was admitted with more of the craven reluctance of fear than with the stern joy that a warrior should feel in finding an enemy within reach of his blow the news had been brought towards the decline of a day in midsummer by an indian runner who also bore an urgent request from munro the commander of a work on the shore of the holy lake for a speedy and powerful reinforcement it has already been mentioned that the distance between these two posts was less than five leagues the rude path which originally formed their line of communication had been widened for the passage of wagons so that the distance which had been travelled by the son of the forest in two hours might easily be effected by a detachment of troops with their necessary baggage between the rising and setting of a summer sun the loyal servants of the british crown had given to one of these forest fastnesses the name of william henry and to the other that of fort edward calling each after a favorite prince of the reigning family the veteran scotchman just named held the first with a regiment of regulars and a few provincials a force really by far too small to make head against the formidable power that montcalm was leading to the foot of his earthen mounds at the latter however lay general webb who commanded the armies of the king in the northern provinces with a body of more than five thousand men by uniting the several detachments of his command this officer might have arrayed nearly double that number of combatants against the enterprising frenchman who had ventured so far from his reinforcements with an army but little superior in numbers but under the influence of their degraded fortunes both officers and men appeared better disposed to await the approach of their formidable antagonists within their works than to resist the progress of their march by emulating the successful example of the french at fort du quesne and striking a blow on their advance after the first surprise of the intelligence had a little abated a rumor was spread through the entrenched camp which stretched along the margin of the hudson forming a chain of outworks to the body of the fort itself that a chosen detachment of fifteen hundred men was to depart with the dawn for william henry the post at the northern extremity of the portage that which at first was only rumor soon became certainty as orders passed from the quarters of the commander in chief to the several corps he had selected for this service to prepare for their speedy departure all doubt as to the intention of webb

man whose back was towards me the man turned at the instant when i came in and i saw john herncastle with a torch in one hand and a dagger dripping with blood in the other a stone set like a pommel in the end of the dagger s handle flashed in the torchlight as he turned on me like a gleam of fire the dying indian sank to his knees pointed to the dagger in herncastle s hand and said in his native language the moonstone will have its vengeance yet on you and yours he spoke those words and fell dead on the floor before i could stir in the matter the men who had followed me across the courtyard crowded in my cousin rushed to meet them like a madman clear the room he shouted to me and set a guard on the door the men fell back as he threw himself on them with his torch and his dagger i put two sentinels of my own company on whom i could rely to keep the door through the remainder of the night i saw no more of my cousin early in the morning the plunder still going on general baird announced publicly by beat of drum that any thief detected in the fact be he whom he might should be hung the provost marshal was in attendance to prove that the general was in earnest and in the throng that followed the proclamation herncastle and i met again he held out his hand as usual and said good morning i waited before i gave him my hand in return tell me first i said how the indian in the armoury met his death and what those last words meant when he pointed to the dagger in your hand the indian met his death as i suppose by a mortal wound said herncastle what his last words meant i know no more than you do i looked at him narrowly his frenzy of the previous day had all calmed down i determined to give him another chance is that all you have to tell me i asked he answered that is all i turned my back on him and we have not spoken since iv i beg it to be understood that what i write here about my cousin unless some necessity should arise for making it public is for the information of the family only herncastle has said nothing that can justify me in speaking to our commanding officer he has been taunted more than once about the diamond by those who recollect his angry outbreak before the assault but as may easily be imagined his own remembrance of the circumstances under which i surprised him in the armoury has been enough to keep him silent it is reported that he means to exchange into another regiment avowedly for the purpose of separating himself from me whether this be true or not i cannot prevail upon myself to become his accuser and i think with good reason if i made the matter public i have no evidence but moral evidence to bring forward i have not only no proof that he killed the two men at the door i cannot even declare that he killed the third man inside for i cannot say that my own eyes saw the deed committed it is true that i heard the dying indian s words but if those words were pronounced to be the ravings of delirium how could i contradict the assertion from my own knowledge let our relatives on either side form their own opinion on what i have written and decide for themselves whether the aversion i now feel towards this man is well or ill founded although i attach no sort of credit to the fantastic indian legend of the gem i must acknowledge before i conclude that i am influenced by a certain superstition of my own in this matter it is my conviction or my delusion no matter which that crime brings its own fatality with it i am not only persuaded of herncastle s guilt i am even fanciful enough to believe that he will live to regret it if he keeps the diamond and that others will live to regret taking it from him if he gives the diamond away

consideration and necessary to convey to you that information of the state of the union which it is my duty to afford the welfare of our country is the great object to which our cares and efforts ought to be directed and i shall derive great satisfaction from a cooperation with you in the pleasing though arduous task of insuring to our fellow citizens the blessings which they have a right to expect from a free efficient and equal government state of the union address george washington december fellow citizens of the senate and house of representatives in meeting you again i feel much satisfaction in being able to repeat my congratulations on the favorable prospects which continue to distinguish our public affairs the abundant fruits of another year have blessed our country with plenty and with the means of a flourishing commerce the progress of public credit is witnessed by a considerable rise of american stock abroad as well as at home and the revenues allotted for this and other national purposes have been productive beyond the calculations by which they were regulated this latter circumstance is the more pleasing as it is not only a proof of the fertility of our resources but as it assures us of a further increase of the national respectability and credit and let me add as it bears an honorable testimony to the patriotism and integrity of the mercantile and marine part of our citizens the punctuality of the former in discharging their engagements has been exemplary in conformity to the powers vested in me by acts of the last session a loan of florins toward which some provisional measures had previously taken place has been completed in holland as well the celerity with which it has been filled as the nature of the terms considering the more than ordinary demand for borrowing created by the situation of europe give a reasonable hope that the further execution of those powers may proceed with advantage and success the secretary of the treasury has my directions to communicate such further particulars as may be requisite for more precise information since your last sessions i have received communications by which it appears that the district of kentucky at present a part of virginia has concurred in certain propositions contained in a law of that state in consequence of which the district is to become a distinct member of the union in case the requisite sanction of congress be added for this sanction application is now made i shall cause the papers on this very transaction to be laid before you the liberality and harmony with which it has been conducted will be found to do great honor to both the parties and the sentiments of warm attachment to the union and its present government expressed by our fellow citizens of kentucky can not fail to add an affectionate concern for their particular welfare to the great national impressions under which you will decide on the case submitted to you it has been heretofore known to congress that frequent incursions have been made on our frontier settlements by certain banditti of indians from the northwest side of the ohio these with some of the tribes dwelling on and near the wabash have of late been particularly active in their depredations and being emboldened by the impunity of their crimes and aided by such parts of the neighboring tribes as could be seduced to join in their hostilities or afford them a retreat for their prisoners and plunder they have instead of listening to the humane invitations and overtures made on the part of the united states renewed their violences with fresh alacrity and greater effect the lives of a number of valuable citizens have thus been sacrificed and some of them under circumstances peculiarly shocking whilst others have been carried into a deplorable captivity these aggravated provocations rendered it essential to the safety of the western settlements that the aggressors should be made sensible that the government of the union is not less capable of punishing their crimes than it is disposed to respect their rights and reward their attachments as this object could not be effected by defensive measures it became necessary to put in force the act which empowers the president to call out the militia for the protection of the frontiers and i have accordingly authorized an expedition in which the regular troops in that quarter are combined with such drafts of militia as were deemed sufficient the event of the measure is yet unknown to me the secretary of war is directed to lay before you a statement of the information on which it is founded as well as an estimate of the expense with which it will be attended the disturbed situation of europe and particularly the critical posture of the great maritime powers whilst it ought to make us the more thankful for the general peace and security enjoyed by the united states reminds us at the same time of the circumspection with which it becomes us to preserve these blessings it requires also that we should not overlook the tendency of a war and even of preparations for a war among the nations most concerned in active commerce with this country to abridge the means and thereby at least enhance the price of transporting its valuable productions to their markets i recommend it to your serious reflections how far and in what mode it may be expedient to guard against embarrassments from these contingencies by such encouragements to our own navigation as will render our commerce and agriculture less dependent on foreign bottoms which may fail us in the very moments most interesting to both of th

mine eyes here therefore courteous reader i present thee with the life and death of mr badman indeed yea i do trace him in his life from his childhood to his death that thou mayest as in a glass behold with thine own eyes the steps that take hold of hell and also discern while thou art reading of mr badmans death whether thou thy self art treading in his path thereto and let me entreat thee to forbear quirking and mocking for that i say mr badman is dead but rather gravely enquire concerning thy self by the word whether thou art one of his linage or no for mr badman has left many of his relations behind him yea the very world is overspread with his kindred true some of his relations as he are gone to their place and long home but thousands of thousands are left behind as brothers sisters cousens nephews besides innumerable of his friends and associates i may say and yet speak nothing but too much truth in so saying that there is scarce a fellowship a community or fraternity of men in the world but some of mr badmans relations are there yea rarely can we find a family or houshold in a town where he has not left behind him either brother nephew or friend the butt therefore that at this time i shoot at is wide and twill be as impossible for this book to go into several families and not to arrest some as for the kings messenger to rush into an house full of traitors and find none but honest men there i cannot but think that this shot will light upon many since our fields are so full of this game but how many it will kill to mr badmans course and make alive to the pilgrims progress that is not in me to determine this secret is with the lord our god only and he alone knows to whom he will bless it to so good and so blessed an end however i have put fire to the pan and doubt not but the report will quickly be heard i told you before that mr badman had left many of his friends and relations behind him but if i survive them as that s a great question to me i may also write of their lives however whether my life be longer or shorter this is my prayer at present that god will stir up witnesses against them that may either convert or confound them for wherever they live and roll in their wickedness they are the pest and plague of that countrey england shakes and totters already by reason of the burden that mr badman and his friends have wickedly laid upon it yea our earth reels and staggereth to and fro like a drunkard the transgression thereof is heavy upon it courteous reader i will treat thee now even at the door and threshold of this house but only with this intelligence that mr badman lies dead within be pleased therefore if thy leisure will serve thee to enter in and behold the state in which he is laid betwixt his death bed and the grave he is not buried as yet nor doth he stink as is designed he shall before he lies down in oblivion now as others have had their funerals solemnized according to their greatness and grandure in the world so likewise mr badman forasmuch as he deserveth not to go down to his grave with silence has his funeral state according to his deserts four things are usual at great mens funerals which we will take leave and i hope without offence to allude to in the funeral of mr badman first they are sometimes when dead presented to their friends by their compleatly wrought images as lively as by cunning mens hands they can be that the remembrance of them may be renewed to their survivors the remembrance of them and their deeds and this i have endeavoured to answer in my discourse of mr badman and therefore i have drawn him forth in his featours and actions from his childhood to his gray hairs here therefore thou hast him lively set forth as in cutts both as to the minority flower and seniority of his age together with those actions of his life that he was most capable of doing in and under those present circumstances of time place strength and the opportunities that did attend him in these secondly there is also usual at great mens funerals those badges and scutcheons of their honour that they have received from their ancestors or have been thought worthy of for the deeds and exploits they have done in their life and here mr badman has his but such as vary from all men of worth but so much the more agreeing with the merit of his doings they all have descended in state he only as an abominable branch his deserts are the deserts of sin and therefore the scutcheons of honour that he has are only that he died without honour and at his end became a fool thou shalt not be joyned with them in burial the seed of evil doers shall never be renowned the funeral pomp therefore of mr badman is to wear upon his hearse the badges of a dishonourable and wicked life since his bones are full of the sins of his youth which shall lye down as job sayes in the dust with him nor is it fit that any should be his attendants now at his death but such as with him conspired against their own souls in their life persons whose transgressions have made them infamous to all that have or shall know what they have done some notice therefore i have also here in this little discourse given the reader of them who were his confederates in his life and attendants at his death with a hint either of some high villany committed by them as also of those judgments that have overtaken and fallen upon them from the just and revenging hand of god all which are things either fully known by me as being eye and ear witness thereto or that i have received from such hands whose relation as to

settle at home as he directed so he would not have so much hand in my misfortunes as to give me any encouragement to go away and to close all he told me i had my elder brother for an example to whom he had used the same earnest persuasions to keep him from going into the low country wars but could not prevail his young desires prompting him to run into the army where he was killed and though he said he would not cease to pray for me yet he would venture to say to me that if i did take this foolish step god would not bless me and i should have leisure hereafter to reflect upon having neglected his counsel when there might be none to assist in my recovery i observed in this last part of his discourse which was truly prophetic though i suppose my father did not know it to be so himself x x i say i observed the tears run down his face very plentifully especially when he spoke of my brother who was killed and that when he spoke of my having leisure to repent and none to assist me he was so moved that he broke off the discourse and told me his heart was so full he could say no more to me i was sincerely affected with this discourse and indeed who could be otherwise and i resolved not to think of going abroad any more but to settle at home according to my father x x s desire but alas a few days wore it all off and in short to prevent any of my father x x s further importunities in a few weeks after i resolved to run quite away from him however i did not act quite so hastily as the first heat of my resolution prompted but i took my mother at a time when i thought her a little more pleasant than ordinary and told her that my thoughts were so entirely bent upon seeing the world that i should never settle to anything with resolution enough to go through with it and my father had better give me his consent than force me to go without it that i was now eighteen years old which was too late to go apprentice to a trade or clerk to an attorney that i was sure if i did i should never serve out my time but i should certainly run away from my master before my time was out and go to sea and if she would speak to my father to let me go one voyage abroad if i came home again and did not like it i would go no more and i would promise by a double diligence to recover the time that i had lost this put my mother into a great passion she told me she knew it would be to no purpose to speak to my father upon any such subject that he knew too well what was my interest to give his consent to anything so much for my hurt and that she wondered how i could think of any such thing after the discourse i had had with my father and such kind and tender expressions as she knew my father had used to me and that in short if i would ruin myself there was no help for me but i might depend i should never have their consent to it that for her part she would not have so much hand in my destruction and i should never have it to say that my mother was willing when my father was not though my mother refused to move it to my father yet i heard afterwards that she reported all the discourse to him and that my father after showing a great concern at it said to her with a sigh x x cthat boy might be happy if he would stay at home but if he goes abroad he will be the most miserable wretch that ever was born i can give no consent to it x x d it was not till almost a year after this that i broke loose though in the meantime i continued obstinately deaf to all proposals of settling to business and frequently expostulated with my father and mother about their being so positively determined against what they knew my inclinations prompted me to but being one day at hull where i went casually and without any purpose of making an elopement at that time but i say being there and one of my companions being about to sail to london in his father x x s ship and prompting me to go with them with the common allurement of seafaring men that it should cost me nothing for my passage i consulted neither father nor mother any more nor so much as sent them word of it but leaving them to hear of it as they might without asking god x x s blessing or my father x x s without any consideration of circumstances or consequences and in an ill hour god knows on the st of september i went on board a ship bound for london never any young adventurer x x s misfortunes i believe began sooner or continued longer than mine the ship was no sooner out of the humber than the wind began to blow and the sea to rise in a most frightful manner and as i had never been at sea before i was most inexpressibly sick in body and terrified in mind i began now seriously to reflect upon what i had done and how justly i was overtaken by the judgment of heaven for my wicked leaving my father x x s house and abandoning my duty all the good counsels of my parents my father x x s tears and my mother x x s entreaties came now fresh into my mind and my conscience which was not yet come to the pitch of hardness to which it has since reproached me with the contempt of advice and the breach of my duty to god and my father all this while the storm increased and the sea went very high though nothing like what i have seen many times since no nor what i saw a few days after but it was enough to affect me then who was but a young sailor and had never known anything of the matter i expected every wave would have swallowed us up and that every time the ship fell down as i thought it did in the trough or hollow of the sea we should never rise more in this agony of mind i made many vows and resolutions that if it would please god to spare my life in this one voyage if ever i got once my foot upon dry land again i would go directly home to my father and never set

pamphlet as a contribution to criticism or critical theory defoe s comments upon specific writers are thoroughly conventional and commonplace as may be seen from a glance at his remarks about milton chaucer spenser shakespeare and others on p of more interest is his very high praise of dryden a man for learning and universal writing in poetry perhaps the greatest that england has produc d p l and his comment upon the critical detraction from which he suffered he compares pope interestingly enough with dryden remarking that pope a person tho inferior to mr dryden yet speaking impartially has few superiors in this age also is persecuted by envy and he has generous praise for that poet s translation of homer one may note that defoe avoids the shortcomings of the critics whom he condemns for judging according to party he distributes his praise indiscriminately between whig and tory writers in short his essay hardly does more than confirm the critical commonplaces of the time and attest to the catholicity of the author s taste of particular interest for students of defoe is the paragraph p l in which defoe defends the hack writers who must write for subsistence one should not expect their writings which are necessarily numerous to be as correct and finished as they might be after comparing their pens to prostitutes because of their venality he claims in a half ironic tone for both authors and booksellers the liberty of writing and printing for either or both sides without ignominy after all they must write and print to live such practice is certainly he observes no more unjust or disreputable than other ways of gaining wealth such as one finds in exchange alley this paragraph gains point when one remembers that defoe had served both whig and tory governments in as letters written to lord stanhope in that very year testify he was engaged in the perhaps dubious business of masquerading as a tory while actually in the service of the whig ministry to take the sting out of the more violent tory periodicals and he was much concerned with the danger of his ambiguous position in december of he had been identified as a writer for mist s weekly journal the leading tory paper and was subjected to growing attacks in the whig press one can hardly doubt that this paragraph is a thinly veiled defense of his own practice as a professional journalist it is no surprise to find the author of a vindication in discussing the qualifications of writers advocating the importance of genius and natural parts above mere learning he instances the author of the true born englishman and shakespeare the former characteriz d as a person of little learning but of prodigious natural parts and the latter having but a small share of literature the further example of the literary achievements of the fair sex who had of course no university education reminds one of defoe s championship elsewhere of women the business of a writer is to please and inform and the general implication is that genius is more necessary to this end than learning also characteristic of defoe is his emphasis upon the advantage to an author of conversation the aliment of genius the life of all airy performances p likewise his digression upon education pp f his charge that people of quality in england all too often neglect their children s education his remarks upon the advantages of travel and the need of training in the vernacular all will be familiar to readers of defoe a vindication of the press is chiefly important for the corroboration of our knowledge of daniel defoe it presents nothing that is new but it gives further evidence of his pride in authorship of his rationalization of his actions as a professional journalist and of his belief in the importance of a free press many of his characteristic ideas are repeated with his usual consistency in point of view although the critical comments in the essay are thoroughly conventional they offer evidence of contemporary literary judgments and reveal defoe as a well informed man of moderation and commonsense though certainly not as a profound critic in the catholicity of his tastes and interests defoe is far ahead of his puritan fellows and his essay may be taken as one indication of the growing interest of the middle classes for whom he wrote in the greater world of literature as professor trent remarks in his ms notes defoe rarely wrote a tract without introducing something worthy of attention and comment and the present pamphlet is no exception to the rule i should like to thank dr henry c

crimes that his worst enemy could not think of without horror he sums up all in the odious name of foreigner this filled me with a kind of rage against the book and gave birth to a trifle which i never could hope should have met with so general an acceptation as it did i mean the true born englishman how this poem was the occasion of my being known to his majesty how i was afterwards received by him how employed and how above my capacity of deserving rewarded is no part of the present case and is only mentioned here as i take all occasions to do for the expressing the honour i ever preserved for the immortal and glorious memory of that greatest and best of princes and whom it was my honour and advantage to call master as well as sovereign whose goodness to me i never forgot neither can forget and whose memory i never patiently heard abused nor ever can do so and who had he lived would never have suffered me to be treated as i have been in the world but heaven for our sins removed him in judgment how far the treatment he met with from the nation he came to save and whose deliverance he finished was admitted by heaven to be a means of his death i desire to forget for their sakes who are guilty and if this calls any of it to mind it is mentioned to move them to treat him better who is now with like principles of goodness and clemency appointed by god and the constitution to be their sovereign lest he that protects righteous princes avenge the injuries they receive from an ungrateful people by giving them up to the confusions their madness leads them to and in their just acclamations at the happy accession of his present majesty to the throne i cannot but advise them to look back and call to mind who it was that first guided them to the family of hanover and to pass by all the popish branches of orleans and savoy recognising the just authority of parliament in the undoubted right of limiting the succession and establishing that glorious maxim of our settlement viz that it is inconsistent with the constitution of this protestant kingdom to be governed by a popish prince i say let them call to mind who it was that guided their thoughts first to the protestant race of our own kings in the house of hanover and that it is to king william next to heaven itself to whom we owe the enjoying a protestant king at this time i need not go back to the particulars of his majesty s conduct in that affair his journey in person to the country of hanover and the court of zell his particular management of the affair afterwards at home perfecting the design by naming the illustrious family to the nation and bringing about a parliamentary settlement to effect it entailing the crown thereby in so effectual a manner as we see has been sufficient to prevent the worst designs of our jacobite people in behalf of the pretender a settlement together with the subsequent acts which followed it and the union with scotland which made it unalterable that gave a complete satisfaction to those who knew and understood it and removed those terrible apprehensions of the pretender which some entertained from the minds of others who were yet as zealous against him as it was possible for any to be upon this settlement as i shall show presently i grounded my opinion which i often expressed viz that i did not see it possible the jacobites could ever set up their idol here and i think my opinion abundantly justified in the consequences of which by and by this digression as a debt to the glorious memory of king william i could not in justice omit and as the reign of his present majesty is esteemed happy and looked upon as a blessing from heaven by us it will most necessarily lead us to bless the memory of king william to whom we owe so much of it how easily could his majesty have led us to other branches whose relation to the crown might have had large pretences what prince but would have submitted to have educated a successor of his race in the protestant religion for the sake of such a crown but the king who had our happiness in view and saw as far into it as any human sight could penetrate who knew we were not to be governed by inexperienced youths that the protestant relig

a medium that a child just born will weigh pounds and in a solar year if tolerably nursed encreaseth to pounds i grant this food will be somewhat dear and therefore very proper for landlords who as they have already devoured most of the parents seem to have the best title to the children infant s flesh will be in season throughout the year but more plentiful in march and a little before and after for we are told by a grave author an eminent french physician that fish being a prolifick dyet there are more children born in roman catholick countries about nine months after lent the markets will be more glutted than usual because the number of popish infants is at least three to one in this kingdom and therefore it will have one other collateral advantage by lessening the number of papists among us i have already computed the charge of nursing a beggar s child in which list i reckon all cottagers labourers and four fifths of the farmers to be about two shillings per annum rags included and i believe no gentleman would repine to give ten shillings for the carcass of a good fat child which as i have said will make four dishes of excellent nutritive meat when he hath only some particular friend or his own family to dine with him thus the squire will learn to be a good landlord and grow popular among his tenants the mother will have eight shillings neat profit and be fit for work till she produces another child those who are more thrifty as i must confess the times require may flea the carcass the skin of which artificially dressed will make admirable gloves for ladies and summer boots for fine gentlemen as to our city of dublin shambles may be appointed for this purpose in the most convenient parts of it and butchers we may be assured will not be wanting although i rather recommend buying the children alive and dressing them hot from the knife as we do roasting pigs a very worthy person a true lover of his country and whose virtues i highly esteem was lately pleased in discoursing on this matter to offer a refinement upon my scheme he said that many gentlemen of this kingdom having of late destroyed their deer he conceived that the want of venison might be well supply d by the bodies of young lads and maidens not exceeding fourteen years of age nor under twelve so great a number of both sexes in every country being now ready to starve for want of work and service and these to be disposed of by their parents if alive or otherwise by their nearest relations but with due deference to so excellent a friend and so deserving a patriot i cannot be altogether in his sentiments for as to the males my american acquaintance assured me from frequent experience that their flesh was generally tough and lean like that of our school boys by continual exercise and their taste disagreeable and to fatten them would not answer the charge then as to the females it would i think with humble submission be a loss to the publick because they soon would become breeders themselves and besides it is not improbable that some scrupulous people might be apt to censure such a practice although indeed very unjustly as a little bordering upon cruelty which i confess hath always been with me the strongest objection against any project how well soever intended but in order to justify my friend he confessed that this expedient was put into his head by the famous salmanaazor a native of the island formosa who came from thence to london above twenty years ago and in conversation told my friend that in his country when any young person happened to be put to death the executioner sold the carcass to persons of quality as a prime dainty and that in his time the body of a plump girl of fifteen who was crucified for an attempt to poison the emperor was sold to his imperial majesty s prime minister of state and other great mandarins of the court in joints from the gibbet at four hundred crowns neither indeed can i deny that if the same use were made of several plump young girls in this town who without one single groat to their fortunes cannot stir abroad without a chair and appear at a play house and assemblies in foreign fineries which they never will pay for the kingdom would not be the worse some persons of a desponding spirit are in great concern about that vast number of poor people who are aged diseased or maimed and i have been desired to employ my thoughts what course may be taken to ease the nation of so grievous an incumbrance but i am not in the least pain upon that matter because it is very well known that they are every day dying and rotting by cold and famine and filth and vermin as fast as can be reasonably expected and as to the young labourers they are now in almost as hopeful a condition they cannot get work and consequently pine away from want of nourishment to a degree that if at any time they are accidentally hired to common labour they have not strength to perform it and thus the country and themselves are happily delivered from the evils to come i have too long digressed and therefore shall return to my subject i think the advantages by the proposal which i have made are obvious and many as well as of the highest importance for first as i have already observed it would greatly lessen the number of papists with whom we are yearly over run being the principal breeders of the nation as well as our most dangerous enemies and who stay at home on purpose with a design to deliver the kingdom to the pretender hoping to take their advantage by the absence of so many good protestants who have chosen rather to leave their country than stay at home and pay tithes against their conscience to an episcopal curate secondly the poorer tenants will have

separated at the outset i never saw him when we forded the river when we planted the english flag in the first breach when we crossed the ditch beyond and fighting every inch of our way entered the town it was only at dusk when the place was ours and after general baird himself had found the dead body of tippoo under a heap of the slain that herncastle and i met we were each attached to a party sent out by the general s orders to prevent the plunder and confusion which followed our conquest the camp followers committed deplorable excesses and worse still the soldiers found their way by a guarded door into the treasury of the palace and loaded themselves with gold and jewels it was in the court outside the treasury that my cousin and i met to enforce the laws of discipline on our own soldiers herncastle s fiery temper had been as i could plainly see exasperated to a kind of frenzy by the terrible slaughter through which we had passed he was very unfit in my opinion to perform the duty that had been entrusted to him there was riot and confusion enough in the treasury but no violence that i saw the men if i may use such an expression disgraced themselves good humouredly all sorts of rough jests and catchwords were bandied about among them and the story of the diamond turned up again unexpectedly in the form of a mischievous joke who s got the moonstone was the rallying cry which perpetually caused the plundering as soon as it was stopped in one place to break out in another while i was still vainly trying to establish order i heard a frightful yelling on the other side of the courtyard and at once ran towards the cries in dread of finding some new outbreak of the pillage in that direction i got to an open door and saw the bodies of two indians by their dress as i guessed officers of the palace lying across the entrance dead a cry inside hurried me into a room which appeared to serve as an armoury a third indian mortally wounded was sinking at the feet of a man whose back was towards me the man turned at the instant when i came in and i saw john herncastle with a torch in one hand and a dagger dripping with blood in the other a stone set like a pommel in the end of the dagger s handle flashed in the torchlight as he turned on me like a gleam of fire the dying indian sank to his knees pointed to the dagger in herncastle s hand and said in his native language the moonstone will have its vengeance yet on you and yours he spoke those words and fell dead on the floor before i could stir in the matter the men who had followed me across the courtyard crowded in my cousin rushed to meet them like a madman clear the room he shouted to me and set a guard on the door the men fell back as he threw himself on them with his torch and his dagger i put two sentinels of my own company on whom i could rely to keep the door through the remainder of the night i saw no more of my cousin early in the morning the plunder still going on general baird announced publicly by beat of drum that any thief detected in the fact be he whom he might should be hung the provost marshal was in attendance to prove that the general was in earnest and in the throng that followed the proclamation herncastle and i met again he held out his hand as usual and said good morning i waited before i gave him my hand in return tell me first i said how the indian in the armoury met his death and what those last words meant when he pointed to the dagger in your hand the indian met his death as i suppose by a mortal wound said herncastle what his last words meant i know no more than you do i looked at him narrowly his frenzy of the previous day had all calmed down i determined to give him another chance is that all you have to tell me i asked he answered that is all i turned my back on him and we have not spoken since iv i beg it to be understood that what i write here about my cousin unless some necessity should arise for making it public is for the information of the family only herncastle has said nothing that can justify me in speaking to our commanding officer he has been taunted more than once about the diamond by those who recollect his angry outbreak before the assault but as may easily be imagined his own remembrance of the circumstances under which i surprised him in the armoury has been enough to keep him silent it is reported that he means to exchange into another regiment avowedly for the purpose of separating himself from me whether this be true or not i cannot prevail upon myself to become his accuser and i think with good reason if i made the matter public i have no evidence but moral evidence to bring forward i have not only no proof that he killed the two men at the door i cannot even declare that he killed the third man inside for i cannot say that my own eyes saw the deed committed it is true that i heard the dying indian s words but if those words were pronounced to be the ravings of delirium how could i contradict the assertion from my own knowledge let our relatives on either side form their own opinion on what i have written and decide for themselves whether the aversion i now feel towards this man is well or ill founded although i attach no sort of credit to the fantastic indian legend of the gem i must acknowledge before i conclude that i am influenced by a certain superstition of my own in this matter it is my conviction or my delusion no matter which that crime brings its own fatality with it i am not only persuaded of herncastle s guilt i am even fanciful enough to believe that he will live to regret it if he keeps the diamond and that others will live to regret taking it from him if he gives the diamond away

any singular particular of moment i believe any man who reads this paper will look upon me to be at least a person of as much honesty and understanding as a common maker of almanacks i do not lurk in the dark i am not wholly unknown in the world i have set my name at length to be a mark of infamy to mankind if they shall find i deceive them in one thing i must desire to be forgiven that i talk more sparingly of home affairs as it will be imprudence to discover secrets of state so it would be dangerous to my person but in smaller matters and that are not of publick consequence i shall be very free and the truth of my conjectures will as much appear from those as the other as for the most signal events abroad in france flanders italy and spain i shall make no scruple to predict them in plain terms some of them are of importance and i hope i shall seldom mistake the day they will happen therefore i think good to inform the reader that i all along make use of the old style observed in england which i desire he will compare with that of the news papers at the time they relate the actions i mention i must add one word more i know it hath been the opinion of several of the learned who think well enough of the true art of astrology that the stars do only incline and not force the actions or wills of men and therefore however i may proceed by right rules yet i cannot in prudence so confidently assure the events will follow exactly as i predict them i hope i have maturely considered this objection which in some cases is of no little weight for example a man may by the influence of an over ruling planet be disposed or inclined to lust rage or avarice and yet by the force of reason overcome that bad influence and this was the case of socrates but as the great events of the world usually depend upon numbers of men it cannot be expected they should all unite to cross their inclinations from pursuing a general design wherein they unanimously agree besides the influence of the stars reaches to many actions and events which are not any way in the power of reason as sickness death and what we commonly call accidents with many more needless to repeat but now it is time to proceed to my predictions which i have begun to calculate from the time that the sun enters into aries and this i take to be properly the beginning of the natural year i pursue them to the time that he enters libra or somewhat more which is the busy period of the year the remainder i have not yet adjusted upon account of several impediments needless here to mention besides i must remind the reader again that this is but a specimen of what i design in succeeding years to treat more at large if i may have liberty and encouragement my first prediction is but a trifle yet i will mention it to show how ignorant those sottish pretenders to astrology are in their own concerns it relates to partridge the almanack maker i have consulted the stars of his nativity by my own rules and find he

should be ruined for his mistakes in july he was brought to trial found guilty and sentenced to be imprisoned to stand in the pillory and to pay a fine of two hundred marks he underwent the infamous part of the punishment with great fortitude and it seems to have been generally thought that he was treated with unreasonable severity so far was he from being ashamed of his fate himself that he wrote a hymn to the pillory which thus ends alluding to his accusers tell them the men that plac d him here are scandals to the times are at a loss to find his guilt and can t commit his crimes pope who has thought fit to introduce him in his dunciad probably from no other reason than party difference characterizes him in the following line earless on high stood unabash d de foe this is one of those instances of injustice and malignity which so frequently occur in the dunciad and which reflect more dishonour on the author than on the parties traduced de foe lay friendless and distressed in newgate his family ruined and himself without hopes of deliverance till sir robert harley who approved of his principles and foresaw that during a factious age such a genius could be converted to many uses represented his unmerited sufferings to the queen and at length procured his release the treasurer lord godolphin also sent a considerable sum to his wife and family and to him money to pay his fine and the expense of his discharge gratitude and fidelity are inseparable from an honest man and it was this benevolent act that prompted de foe to support harley with his able and ingenious pen when anne lay lifeless and his benefactor in the vicissitude of party was persecuted by faction and overpowered though not conquered by violence the talents and perseverance of de foe began now to be properly estimated and as a firm supporter of the administration he was sent by lord godolphin to scotland on an errand which as he says was far from being unfit for a sovereign to direct or an honest man to perform his knowledge of commerce and revenue his powers of insinuation and above all his readiness of pen were deemed of no small utility in promoting the union of the two kingdoms of which he wrote an able history in with two dedications one to the queen and another to the duke of queensbury soon afterwards he unhappily by some equivocal writings rendered himself suspected by both parties so that he once more retired to newington in hopes of spending the remainder of his days in peace his pension being withdrawn and wearied with politics he began to compose works of a different kind the year may therefore be regarded as the period of de foe s political life faction henceforth found other advocates and parties procured other writers to disseminate their suggestions and to propagate their falsehoods in de foe published the family instructor a work inculcating the domestic duties in a lively manner by narration and dialogue and displaying much knowledge of life in the middle ranks of society religious courtship also appeared soon after which like the family instructor is eminently religious and moral in its tendency and strongly impresses on the mind that spirit of sobriety and private devotion for which the dissenters have generally been distinguished the most celebrated of all his works the life and adventures of robinson crusoe appeared in this work has passed through numerous editions and been translated into almost all modern languages the great invention which is displayed in it the variety of incidents and circumstances which it contains related in the most easy and natural manner together with the excellency of the moral and religious reflections render it a performance of very superior and uncommon merit and one of the most interesting works that ever appeared it is strongly recommended by rosseau as a book admirably calculated to promote the purposes of natural education and dr blair says no fiction in any language was ever better supported than the adventures of robinson crusoe while it is carried on with that appearance of truth and simplicity which takes a strong hold of the imagination of all readers it suggests at the same time very useful instruction by showing how much the native powers of man may be exerted for surmounting the difficulties of any external situation it has been pretended that de foe surreptitiously

settle at home as he directed so he would not have so much hand in my misfortunes as to give me any encouragement to go away and to close all he told me i had my elder brother for an example to whom he had used the same earnest persuasions to keep him from going into the low country wars but could not prevail his young desires prompting him to run into the army where he was killed and though he said he would not cease to pray for me yet he would venture to say to me that if i did take this foolish step god would not bless me and i should have leisure hereafter to reflect upon having neglected his counsel when there might be none to assist in my recovery i observed in this last part of his discourse which was truly prophetic though i suppose my father did not know it to be so himself x x i say i observed the tears run down his face very plentifully especially when he spoke of my brother who was killed and that when he spoke of my having leisure to repent and none to assist me he was so moved that he broke off the discourse and told me his heart was so full he could say no more to me i was sincerely affected with this discourse and indeed who could be otherwise and i resolved not to think of going abroad any more but to settle at home according to my father x x s desire but alas a few days wore it all off and in short to prevent any of my father x x s further importunities in a few weeks after i resolved to run quite away from him however i did not act quite so hastily as the first heat of my resolution prompted but i took my mother at a time when i thought her a little more pleasant than ordinary and told her that my thoughts were so entirely bent upon seeing the world that i should never settle to anything with resolution enough to go through with it and my father had better give me his consent than force me to go without it that i was now eighteen years old which was too late to go apprentice to a trade or clerk to an attorney that i was sure if i did i should never serve out my time but i should certainly run away from my master before my time was out and go to sea and if she would speak to my father to let me go one voyage abroad if i came home again and did not like it i would go no more and i would promise by a double diligence to recover the time that i had lost this put my mother into a great passion she told me she knew it would be to no purpose to speak to my father upon any such subject that he knew too well what was my interest to give his consent to anything so much for my hurt and that she wondered how i could think of any such thing after the discourse i had had with my father and such kind and tender expressions as she knew my father had used to me and that in short if i would ruin myself there was no help for me but i might depend i should never have their consent to it that for her part she would not have so much hand in my destruction and i should never have it to say that my mother was willing when my father was not though my mother refused to move it to my father yet i heard afterwards that she reported all the discourse to him and that my father after showing a great concern at it said to her with a sigh x x cthat boy might be happy if he would stay at home but if he goes abroad he will be the most miserable wretch that ever was born i can give no consent to it x x d it was not till almost a year after this that i broke loose though in the meantime i continued obstinately deaf to all proposals of settling to business and frequently expostulated with my father and mother about their being so positively determined against what they knew my inclinations prompted me to but being one day at hull where i went casually and without any purpose of making an elopement at that time but i say being there and one of my companions being about to sail to london in his father x x s ship and prompting me to go with them with the common allurement of seafaring men that it should cost me nothing for my passage i consulted neither father nor mother any more nor so much as sent them word of it but leaving them to hear of it as they might without asking god x x s blessing or my father x x s without any consideration of circumstances or consequences and in an ill hour god knows on the st of september i went on board a ship bound for london never any young adventurer x x s misfortunes i believe began sooner or continued longer than mine the ship was no sooner out of the humber than the wind began to blow and the sea to rise in a most frightful manner and as i had never been at sea before i was most inexpressibly sick in body and terrified in mind i began now seriously to reflect upon what i had done and how justly i was overtaken by the judgment of heaven for my wicked leaving my father x x s house and abandoning my duty all the good counsels of my parents my father x x s tears and my mother x x s entreaties came now fresh into my mind and my conscience which was not yet come to the pitch of hardness to which it has since reproached me with the contempt of advice and the breach of my duty to god and my father all this while the storm increased and the sea went very high though nothing like what i have seen many times since no nor what i saw a few days after but it was enough to affect me then who was but a young sailor and had never known anything of the matter i expected every wave would have swallowed us up and that every time the ship fell down as i thought it did in the trough or hollow of the sea we should never rise more in this agony of mind i made many vows and resolutions that if it would please god to spare my life in this one voyage if ever i got once my foot upon dry land again i would go directly home to my father and never set

the words be for the pretender and this can be no otherwise understood than to have a design however remote and upon whatever views to bring him in to possess the throne of these kingdoms the matter then being laid down thus as sincerely and plainly as possible we come to the question point blank and think it our duty to say with the greatest sincerity that we do not believe the ministry are in any kind or with any prospect near or remote acting for or with a design or view to bring in the pretender having granted this we must however to prevent any breaking in by way of cavil on one hand or triumph on the other subjoin immediately that we do not in the least grant by this that the protestant succession is in no danger even from several of the measures now taken in the world it is far from any reflection upon the ministry to say that however they may act upon a right sincere principle for the protestant succession in all they do which as above we profess to believe yet that many of the tools they make use of are of another make and have no edge to cut any other way no thoughts to move them towards any other end no other centre which they can have any tendency to that the pretender s interest is the magnet which draws them by its secret influence to point to him as their pole that they have their aim at his establishment here and own it to be their aim and as they are not shy to profess it among themselves so their conduct in many things makes it sufficiently public this is not meant as any reflection upon the ministry for making use of such men the late ministry did the same and every ministry will and must employ men sometimes not as they always join with them in their politic principles but as either the men are found useful in their several employments or as the ministry may be under other circumstances which makes it necessary to them to employ them nor as the review well enough observed does it follow that because the ministry have employed or joined with jacobites in the public affairs that therefore they must have done it with a jacobite principle but let the ministry employ these men by what necessity or upon what occasion they will though it may not follow that the ministry are therefore for the pretender yet it does not also follow that there is no danger of the protestant succession from the employing those sort of people for what if the queen should die the ministry it is hoped are established in the interest of their queen and country and therefore it has been argued that supposing the ministry had the pretender in their eye yet that it is irrational to suggest that they can have any such view during the life of her present majesty nay even those professed jacobites who we spoke of just now cannot be so ungrateful to think of deposing the queen who has been so bountiful so kind so exceeding good to them as in several cases to suffer them to be brought into the management of her own affairs when by their character they might have been thought dangerous even to her person thus winning and engaging them by her bounty and the confidence that has been placed in them not to attempt anything to her prejudice without the most monstrous ingratitude without flying in the face of all that sense of honour and obligation which it is possible for men of common sense to entertain and it can hardly be thought that even papists themselves under the highest possessions of their religious zeal can conquer the native aversions they must have to such abominable ingratitude or to think of bringing in the pretender upon this protestant nation even while the queen shall be on the throne but though this may and some doubt that also tie up their hands during the queen s life yet they themselves give us but small reason to expect anything from them afterward and it will be hard to find anybody to vouch for them then these very jacobites papists and professed enemies to the revolution may be supposed upon these pretensions to be quiet and offer no violence to the present establishment while her majesty has the possession and while that life lasts to which they are so much indebted for her royal goodness and clemency but what would they do if the queen should die come we next to the french king we are told that not the french king only but even the whole french nation are wonderfully forward to acknowledge the obligation they are under to the justice and favour which they have received from her majesty in the putting an end to the war a war which lay heavy upon them and threatened the very name of the french nation with ruin and much more threatened the glory of the french court and of their great monarch with an entire overthrow a total eclipse a war which by their own confession it was impossible for them long to have supported the expenses of and which by the great superiority of the allies became dreadful to them and that every campaign more than the other a war which they were in such pain to see the end of that they tried all the powers and courts in christendom who were the least neutral to engage a mediation in order to a treaty and all in vain and a war which if her majesty had not inclined to put an end to must have ended perhaps to the disadvantage and confusion of both france and spain if not of all christendom the obligations the french are under for the bringing this war to so just and honourable a conclusion are not at all concealed nay the french themselves have not been backward to make them public the declarations made by the french king of his sincerity in the overtures made for a general peace the protestations of his being resolved to enter into an entire confidence and a league offensive and defensive with the queen s majesty for the

people it now ceased to be so almost completely with the support which such methods secured along with encouragement from his ministers the king was prepared to put in operation his policy for regulating the affairs of america writs of assistance were followed by the passage of the stamp act the ostensible object of both these measures was to help pay the debt incurred by the french war but the real purpose lay deeper and was nothing more or less than the ultimate extension of parliamentary rule in great things as well as small to america at this crisis so momentous for the colonists the rockingham ministry was formed and burke together with pitt supported a motion for the unconditional repeal of the stamp act after much wrangling the motion was carried and the first blunder of the mother country seemed to have been smoothed over only a few months elapsed however when the question of taxing the colonies was revived pitt lay ill and could take no part in the proposed measure through the influence of other members of his party notably townshend a series of acts were passed imposing duties on several exports to america this was followed by a suspension of the new york assembly because it had disregarded instructions in the matter of supplies for the troops the colonists were furious matters went from bad to worse to withdraw as far as possible without yielding the principle at stake the duties on all the exports mentioned in the bill were removed except that on tea but it was precisely the principle for which the colonists were contending they were not in the humor for compromise when they believed their freedom was endangered and the strength and determination of their resistance found a climax in the boston tea party in the meantime lord north who was absolutely obedient to the king had become prime minister five bills were prepared the tenor of which it was thought would overawe the colonists of these the boston port bill and the regulating act are perhaps the most famous though the ultimate tendency of all was blindly coercive while the king and his friends were busy with these the opposition proposed an unconditional repeal of the tea act the bill was introduced only to be overwhelmingly defeated by the same parliament that passed the five measures of lord north in america the effect of these proceedings was such as might have been expected by thinking men the colonies were as a unit in their support of massachusetts the regulating act was set at defiance public officers in the king s service were forced to resign town meetings were held and preparations for war were begun in dead earnest to avert this some of england s greatest statesmen pitt among the number asked for a reconsideration on february the first a bill was introduced which would have gone far toward bringing peace one month later burke delivered his speech on conciliation with the colonies edmund burke there is nothing unusual in burke s early life he was born in dublin ireland in his father was a successful lawyer and a protestant his mother a catholic at the age of twelve he became a pupil of abraham shackleton a quaker who had been teaching some fifteen years at ballitore a small town thirty miles from dublin in after years burke was always pleased to speak of his old friend in the kindest way if i am anything he declares it is the education i had there that has made me so and again at shackleton s death when burke was near the zenith of his fame and popularity he writes i had a true honor and affection for that excellent man i feel something like a satisfaction in the midst of my concern that i was fortunate enough to have him under my roof before his departure it can hardly be doubted that the old quaker schoolmaster succeeded with his pupil who was already so favorably inclined and it is more than probable that the daily example of one who lived out his precepts was strong in its influence upon a young and generous mind burke attended school at ballitore two years then at the age of fourteen he became a student at trinity college dublin and remained there five years at college he was unsystematic and careless of routine he seems to have done pretty much as he pleased and however methodical he became in after life his study during these five years was rambling and spasmodic the only definite knowledge we have of this period is given by burke himself in letters to his former friend richard shackleton son of his old schoolmaster what he did was done with a zest that at times became a feverish impatience first i was greatly taken with natural philosophy which while i should have given my mind to logic employed me incessantly this i call my furor mathematicus following in succession come his furor logicus furor historicus and furor peoticus each of which absorbed him for the time being it would be wrong however to think of burke as a trifler even in his youth he read in the library three hours every day and we may be sure he read as intelligently as eagerly it is more than probable that like a few other great minds he did not need a rigid system to guide him if he chose his subjects of study at pleasure there is every reason to believe he mastered them of intimate friends at the university we hear nothing goldsmith came one year later but there is no evidence that they knew each other it is probable that burke always reserved had little in common with his young associates his own musings with occasional attempts at writing poetry long walks through the country and frequent letters to and from richard shackleton employed him when not at his books two years after taking his degree burke went to london and established himself at the middle temple for the u

heavily one thing i m glad of we ll face it together daren we were kids together do you remember playing on the commons straddling the old water gates over the brooks stealing cider from the country presses barefoot boys going to school together we played post office with the girls and indians with the boys we made puppy love to dal and mel and helen and margie all of them then somehow the happy thoughtless years of youth passed it seems strange and sudden now but the war came we enlisted we had the same ideal you and i we went to france and you know what we did there together now we re on this ship getting into port of the good old u s good as bad as she is going home together thank god for that i want to be buried in woodlawn home home we feel its meaning but dare we ll have no home no place we are old we are through we have served we are done what we dreamed of as glory will be cold ashes to our lips bitter as gall you always were a dreamer an idealist a believer in god truth hope and womanhood in spite of the war these somehow survive in you but dare old friend steel yourself now against disappointment and disillusion used as lane was to his comrade s outbursts this one struck singularly home to lane s heart and made him mute the chill of his earlier misgiving returned augmented by a strange uneasiness a premonition of the unknown and dreadful future but he threw it off faith would not die in lane it could not die utterly because of what he felt in himself yet what was in store for him why was his hope so unquenchable there could be no resurgam for daren lane resignation should have brought him peace peace when every nerve in his shell shocked body racked him when he could not subdue a mounting hope that all would be well at home when he quivered at

world daren lane held to his maimed comrade while they stood bare headed and erect for that moment when the ship passed the statue lane knew what blair felt but nothing of what that feeling was could ever be spoken the deck of the ship was now crowded with passengers yet they were seemingly dead to anything more than a safe arrival at their destination they were not crippled american soldiers except these two there were none in service uniforms there across the windy space of water loomed the many eyed buildings suggestive of the great city a low roar of traffic came on the breeze passengers and crew of the liner were glad to dock before dark they took no notice of the rigid erect soldiers lane arm in arm with blair face to the front stood absorbed in his sense of a nameless sublimity for them while passing the statue of liberty the spirit of the first man who ever breathed of freedom for the human race burned as a white flame in the heart of lane and his comrade but it was not so much that spirit which held them erect aloof proud it was a supreme consciousness of immeasurable sacrifice for an ideal that existed only in the breasts of men and women kindred to them an unutterable and never to be spoken glory of the duty done for others but that they owed themselves they had sustained immense loss of health and happiness the future seemed like the gray cold gloomy expanse of the river and there could never be any reward except this white fire of their souls nameless but it was the increasing purpose that ran through the ages the ship docked at dark lane left blair at the rail gloomily gazing down at the confusion and bustle on the wharf and went below to search for their comrade red payson he found him in his stateroom half crouched on the berth apparently oblivious to the important moment it required a little effort to rouse payson he was a slight boy not over twenty two sallow faced and freckled with hair that gave him the only name his comrades knew him by lane packed the boy s few possessions and talked vehemently all the time red braced up ready to go but he had little to say and that with the weary nonchalance habitual with him lane helped him up on deck and the exertion slight as it was brought home to lane that he needed help himself they found maynard waiting well here we are the three musketeers said lane in a voice he tried to make cheerful where s the band inquired maynard sardonically gay old new york and me broke exclaimed red payson as if to himself then the three stood by the rail at the gangplank waiting for the hurried stream of passengers to disembark down on the wharf under the glaring white lights swarmed a crowd from which rose a babel of voices a whistle blew sharply at intervals the whirr and honk of taxicabs and the jangle of trolley cars sounded beyond the wide dark portal of the dock house the murky water below splashed between ship and pier deep voices rang out and merry laughs and shrill glad cries of welcome the bright light shone down upon a motley dark garbed mass moving slowly the spirit of the occasion was manifest when the three disabled soldiers the last passengers to disembark slowly and laboriously descended to the wharf no one offered to help them no one waited with a smile and hand clasp of welcome no one saw them except a burly policeman who evidently had charge of the traffic at the door he poked his club into the ribs of the one legged slowly shuffling maynard and said with cheerful gruffness step lively buddy step lively lane with his two comrades spent three

explanations at this time but there were those there who recognized them and one especially who noted the lithe trim figure and beautiful face of virginia maxon though he did not know even the name of

first speaker townsend j harper jr in a half whisper but i ll bet you a new car that i find out a week later with failing health and shattered nerves professor maxon sailed with his daughter for a long ocean voyage which he hoped would aid him in rapid recuperation and permit him to forget the nightmare memory of those three horrible days and nights in his workshop he believed that he had reached an unalterable decision never again to meddle with the mighty awe inspiring secrets of creation but with returning health and balance he found himself viewing his recent triumph with feelings of renewed hope and anticipation the morbid fears superinduced by the shock following the sudden demise of the first creature of his experiments had given place to a growing desire to further prosecute his labors until enduring success had crowned his efforts with an achievement which he might exhibit with pride to the scientific world his recent disastrous success had convinced him that neither ithaca nor any other abode of civilization was a safe place to continue his experiments but it was not until their cruising had brought them among the multitudinous islands of the east indies that the plan occurred to him that he finally adopted a plan the outcome of which could he then have foreseen would have sent him scurrying to the safety of his own country with the daughter who was to bear the full brunt of the horrors it entailed they were steaming up the china sea when the idea first suggested itself and as he sat idly during the long hot days the thought grew upon him expanding into a thousand wonderful possibilities until it became crystalized into what was a little short of an obsession the result was that at manila much to virginia s surprise he announced the abandonment of the balance of their purposed voyage taking immediate return passage to singapore his daughter did not question him as to the cause of this change in plans for since those three days that her father had kept himself locked in his workroom at home the girl had noticed a subtle change in her parent a marked disinclination to share with her his every confidence as had been his custom since the death of her mother while it grieved her immeasurably she was both too proud and too hurt to sue for a reestablishment of the old relations on all other topics than his scientific work their interests were as mutual as formerly but by what seemed a manner of tacit agreement this subject was taboo and so it was that they came to singapore without the girl having the slightest conception of her father s plans here they spent nearly a month during which time professor maxon was daily engaged in interviewing officials english residents and a motley horde of malays and chinamen virginia met socially several of the men with whom her father was engaged but it was only at the last moment that one of them let drop a hint of the purpose of the month s activity when virginia was present the conversation seemed always deftly guided from the subject of her father s immediate future and she was not long in discerning that it was in no sense through accident that this was true thereafter her wounded pride made easy the task of those who seemed combined to keep her in ignorance it was a dr von horn who had been oftenest with her father who gave her the first intimation of what was forthcoming afterward in recollecting the conversation it seemed to virginia that the young man had been directed to break the news to her that her father might be spared the ordeal it was evident then that he expected opposition but the girl was too loyal to let von horn know if she felt other than in harmony with the proposal and too proud to evince by surprise the fact that she was not wholly conversant with its every detail you are glad to be leaving singapore so soon he had asked although he knew that she had not been advised that an early departure was planned i am rather looking forward to it replied virginia and to a protracted residence on one of the pamarung islands continued von horn why not was her rather non committal reply though she had not the remotest idea of their location von horn admired her nerve though he rather wished that she would ask some questions it was difficult making progress in this way how could he explain the plans when she evinced not the slightest sign that she was not already entirely conversant with them we doubt if the work will be completed under two or three years answered the doctor that will be a long time in which to be isolated upon a savage little speck of land off the larger but no less savage borneo do you think that your bravery is equal to the demands that will be made upon it virginia laughed nor was there the slightest tremor in its note i am equal to whatever fate my father is equal to she said nor do i think that a life upon one of these beautiful little islands would be much of a hardship certainly not

willing to be his slave he listens with deep attention she explains that since her father s death she has been continuously persecuted by the village people on the double count of her italian blood

that he had not improved in the slightest degree since their last meeting and sam who imagined that he had long since grown to man s estate and put off childish things was embarrassed to discover that his aunt still affected him as of old that is to say she made him feel as if he had omitted to shave and in addition to that had swallowed some drug which had caused him to swell unpleasantly particularly about the hands and feet jolly morning said sam perseveringly so i imagine i have not yet been out thought i d look in and see how you were that was very kind of you the morning is my busy time but yes that was very kind of you there was another pause how do you like america said sam i dislike it exceedingly yes well of course some people do prohibition and all that personally it doesn t affect me i can take it or leave it alone the reason i dislike america began mrs hignett bridling i like it myself said sam i ve had a wonderful time everybody s treated me like a rich uncle i ve been in detroit you know and they practically gave me the city and asked me if i d like another to take home in my pocket never saw anything like it i might have been the missing heir i think america s the greatest invention on record and what brought you to america said mrs hignett unmoved by this rhapsody oh i came over to play golf in a tournament you know surely at your age said mrs hignett disapprovingly you could be better occupied do you spend your whole time playing golf oh no i hunt a bit and shoot a bit and i swim a good lot and i still play football occasionally i wonder your father does not insist on your doing some useful work he is beginning to harp on the subject rather i suppose i shall take a stab at it sooner or later father says i ought to get married too he is perfectly right i suppose old eustace will be getting hitched up one of these days said sam mrs hignett started violently why do you say that eh what makes you say that oh well he s a romantic sort of fellow writes poetry and all that there is no likelihood at all of eustace marrying he is of a shy and retiring temperament and sees few women he is almost a recluse sam was aware of this and had frequently regretted it he had always been fond of his cousin and in that half amused and rather patronising way in which men of thews and sinews are fond of the weaker brethren who run more to pallor and intellect and he had always felt that if eustace had not had to retire to windles to spend his life with a woman whom from his earliest years he had always considered the empress of the wash outs much might have been made of him both at school and at oxford eustace had been if not a sport at least a decidedly cheery old bean sam remembered eustace at school breaking gas globes with a slipper in a positively rollicking manner he remembered him at oxford playing up to him manfully at the piano on the occasion when he had done that imitation of frank tinney which had been such a hit at the trinity smoker yes eustace had had the makings of a pretty sound egg and it was too bad that he had allowed his mother to coop him up down in the country miles away from anywhere eustace is returning to england on saturday said mrs hignett she spoke a little wistfully she had not been parted from her son since he had come down from oxford and she would have liked to keep him with her till the end of her lecturing tour that however was out of the question it was imperative that while she was away he should be at windles nothing would have induced her to leave the place at the mercy of servants who might trample over the flower beds scratch the polished floors and forget to cover up the canary at night he sails on the atlantic that s splendid said sam i m sailing on the atlantic myself i ll go down to the office and see if we can t have a state room together but where is he going to live when he gets to england where is he going to live why at windles of course where else but i thought you were letting windles for the summer mrs hignett stared letting windles she spoke as one might address a lunatic what put that extraordinary idea into your head i thought father said something about your letting the place to some american nothing of the kind it seemed to sam that his aunt spoke somewhat vehemently even snappishly in correcting what was a perfectly natural mistake he could not know that the subject of letting windles for the summer was one which had long since begun to infuriate mrs hignett people had certainly asked her to let windles in fact people had pestered her there was a rich fat man an american named bennett whom she had met just before sailing at her brother s house in london invited down to windles for the day mr bennett had fallen in love with the place and had begged her to name her own price not content with this he had pursued her with his pleadings by means of the wireless telegraph while she was on the ocean and had not given up the struggle even when she reached new york he had egged on a friend of his a mr mortimer to continue the persecution in that city and this very morning among the letters on mrs hignett s table the buff envelope of a cable from mr bennett had peeped out nearly spoiling her breakfast no wonder then that sam s allusion to the affair had caused the authoress of the spreading light momentarily to lose her customary calm nothing will induce me ever to let windles she said with finality and rose significantly sam perceiving that the audience was at an end and glad of it also got up well i think i ll

of the drive i ll come and see you off no no mr hutton was playful but determined you must do no such thing i simply forbid you but i should like to come miss spence protested throwing a rapid

like a boy s he was proud of that run it was quite marvellously youthful still he was glad the drive was no longer at the last bend before passing out of sight of the house he halted and turned round miss spence was still standing on the steps smiling her smile he waved his hand and this time quite definitely and overtly wafted a kiss in her direction then breaking once more into his magnificent canter he rounded the last dark promontory of trees once out of sight of the house he let his high paces decline to a trot and finally to a walk he took out his handkerchief and began wiping his neck inside his collar what fools what fools had there ever been such an ass as poor dear janet spence never unless it was himself decidedly he was the more malignant fool since he at least was aware of his folly and still persisted in it why did he persist ah the problem that was himself the problem that was other people he had reached the gate a large prosperous looking motor was standing at the

lurked within oh teddy bear what an age you ve been it was a fresh and childish voice that spoke the words there was the faintest hint of cockney impurity about the vowel sounds mr hutton bent his

front window was stonily impassive the back of a statue your hands doris whispered oh you mustn t touch me they give me electric shocks mr hutton adored her for the virgin imbecility of the words how late in one s existence one makes the discovery of one s body the electricity isn t in me it s in you he kissed her again whispering her name several times doris doris doris the scientific appellation of the sea mouse he was thinking as he kissed the throat she offered him white and extended like the throat of a victim awaiting the sacrificial knife the sea mouse was a sausage with iridescent fur

of humiliation jacob felt a little thrill of triumph at the thought of mr bultiwell s three gardeners it took more than gardeners to grow such a rose as he was wearing he liked to fancy that it took personal care personal sympathy personal love the sweetest and rarest flowers must have their special atmosphere quite suddenly mr edward bultiwell laid down his times and glared across at jacob he was a large man with an ugly red face a neck which hung over his collar in rolls and a resonant voice directly he began to speak jacob began to shiver pratt he said am i to understand that the greeting which you offered to the occupants of this carriage when you entered was intended to include me i i certainly meant it to was the tremulous reply then let me beg that such a liberty be not repeated mr bultiwell continued brutally i look upon a man who has compounded with his creditors as a person temporarily at any rate outside the pale of converse with his fellows on er equal terms i look upon your presence in a first class carriage wearing a floral adornment mr bultiwell added with a jealous glance at the very beautiful rose which is to say the least of it conspicuous as er an impertinence to those who have had the misfortune to suffer from your insolvency the healthy colour faded from jacob s cheeks he had the air of one stricken by a lash dazed for the moment and bewildered my rose cost me nothing he faltered and my season ticket doesn t expire till next month i must go up to the city my help is needed with the books mr bultiwell shook his paper preparatory to disappearing behind it your presence here may be considered a matter of taste he fired off as a parting shot i call it damned bad taste mr jacob pratt sat like a hurt thing till the train stopped at the next station then he stumbled out on to the platform and making his way through an unaccountable mist he climbed somehow or other into a third class carriage richard dauncey the melancholy man who lived in the cottage opposite to his looked up at the newcomer s entrance and for the first time within his recollection jacob saw him smile good morning mr pratt the former said with a strenuous attempt at cordiality if you ll excuse my saying so that s the finest rose i ve ever seen in my life richard dauncey made his fortune by that speech and jacob had to swallow very hard and look very fixedly out of the window chapter i precisely two years later jacob pratt sat once more in his cottage sitting room contemplating the remains of a barely tasted breakfast before him read for the fiftieth time were the wonderful letters in his brain a most amazing confusion in his heart an almost hysterical joy presently mrs harris brought in his hat and stick you ll excuse my mentioning it sir she said looking at the former a little disparagingly but brush though i may there s no doing much with this hat of yours the nap s fair gone maybe you haven t noticed it sir but with the summer coming on a straw hat i ll buy a straw hat to day mrs harris jacob promised and you ll be home at the usual time for your supper sir i i expect so i am not quite sure mrs harris i shall be home sometime during the day all right mrs harris shook her head at the sight of the untasted egg you ll excuse my saying so sir she pronounced severely but there s no good work done on an empty stomach times is hard as we all know but eggs is cheap mrs harris jacob reminded her it is two years since i left one of your eggs i left it then because i was miserable i am leaving it this morning because i have had good news i can t eat later on later on mrs harris and a bit of good news is what you deserve sir the latter declared lingering while he cut his accustomed rose with fingers which trembled strangely thank you very much mrs harris he said when i come back to night i ll tell you all about it once more then two years almost to a day after mr edward bultiwell of the great firm of bultiwell and sons had laid down his newspaper and spoken his mind jacob was on his way to the station again wearing a choice rose in his buttonhole he had found no occasion to change his lodgings for he had been an economical man who took great care of his possessions even in the days of his prosperity and his moderate salary as traveller for a bermondsey firm of merchants brought him in quite enough for his simple needs he had to some extent lived down his disgrace the manager of the international stores nodded to him now a trifle condescendingly yet with tacit acknowledgement of the fact that in domestic affairs jacob was a man of principle who always paid his way the greengrocer s wife passed the time of day when not too preoccupied and the newspaper boy no longer clutched for his penny jacob generally met the melancholy man at the corner of the avenue and walked to the station with him and he still grew roses and worshipped them on the way to the station on this particular morning he amazed his friend richard he said i shall not travel to the city with you to day at least i shall not start with you i shall change carriages at wendley as i did once before the devil richard exclaimed they were passing the plate glass window of a new emporium and jacob paused to glance furtively at his reflection he was an exceedingly neat man and his care for his clothes and person had survived two years of impecuniosity nevertheless although he passed muster well enough to the casual observer there were indications in his attire of the inevitable conflict between a desire for adornment and the lack of means to indulge it his too often pressed trousers were thin at the seams his linen thoug

in the cathedral of worcester during the years he had served as master of fence at the english court the sons of royalty had learned to thrust and parry and cut as only de vac could teach the art and he had been as conscientious in the discharge of his duties as he had been in his unswerving hatred and contempt for his pupils and now the english king had put upon him such an insult as might only be wiped out by blood as the blow fell the wiry frenchman clicked his heels together and throwing down his foil he stood erect and rigid as a marble statue before his master white and livid was his tense drawn face but he spoke no word he might have struck the king but then there would have been left to him no alternative save death by his own hand for a king may not fight with a lesser mortal and he who strikes a king may not live the king s honor must be satisfied had a french king struck him de vac would have struck back and gloried in the fate which permitted him to die for the honor of france but an english king pooh a dog and who would die for a dog no de vac would find other means of satisfying his wounded pride he would revel in revenge against this man for whom he felt no loyalty if possible he would harm the whole of england if he could but he would bide his time he could afford to wait for his opportunity if by waiting he could encompass a more terrible revenge de vac had been born in paris the son of a french officer reputed the best swordsman in france the son had followed closely in the footsteps of his father until on the latter s death he could easily claim the title of his sire how he had left france and entered the service of john of england is not of this story all the bearing that the life of jules de vac has upon the history of england hinges upon but two of his many attributes his wonderful swordsmanship and his fearful hatred for his adopted country chapter ii south of the armory of westminster palace lay the gardens and here on the third day following the king s affront to de vac might have been a seen a black haired woman gowned in a violet cyclas richly embroidered with gold about the yoke and at the bottom of the loose pointed sleeves which reached almost to the similar bordering on the lower hem of the garment a richly wrought leathern girdle studded with precious stones and held in place by a huge carved buckle of gold clasped the garment about her waist so that the upper portion fell outward over the girdle after the manner of a blouse in the girdle was a long dagger of beautiful workmanship dainty sandals encased her feet while a wimple of violet silk bordered in gold fringe lay becomingly over her head and shoulders by her side walked a handsome boy of about three clad like his companion in gay colors his tiny surcoat of scarlet velvet was rich with embroidery while beneath was a close fitting tunic of white silk his doublet was of scarlet while his long hose of white were cross gartered with scarlet from his tiny sandals to his knees on the back of his brown curls sat a flat brimmed round crowned hat in which a single plume of white waved and nodded bravely at each move of the proud little head the child s features were well molded and his frank bright eyes gave an expression of boyish generosity to a face which otherwise would have been too arrogant and haughty for such a mere baby as he talked with his companion little flashes of peremptory authority and dignity which sat strangely upon one so tiny caused the young woman at times to turn her head from him that he might not see the smiles which she could scarce repress presently the boy took a ball from his tunic and pointing at a little bush near them said stand you there lady maud by yonder bush i would play at toss the young woman did as she was bid and when she had taken her place and turned to face him the boy threw the ball to her thus they played beneath the windows of the armory the boy running blithely after the ball when he missed it and laughing and shouting in happy glee when he made a particularly good catch in one of the windows of the armory overlooking the garden stood a grim gray old man leaning upon his folded arms his brows drawn together in a malignant scowl the corners of his mouth set in a stern cold line he looked upon the garden and the playing child and upon the lovely young woman beneath him but with eyes which did not see for de vac was working out a great problem the greatest of all his life for three days the old man had brooded over his grievance seeking for some means to be revenged upon the king for the insult which henry had put upon him many schemes had presented themselves to his shrewd and cunning mind but so far all had been rejected as unworthy of the terrible satisfaction which his wounded pride demanded his fancies had for the most part revolved about the unsettled political conditions of henry s reign for from these he felt he might wrest that opportunity which could be turned to his own personal uses and to the harm and possibly the undoing of the king for years an inmate of the palace and often a listener in the armory when the king played at sword with his friends and favorites de vac had heard much which passed between henry iii and his intimates that could well be turned to the king s harm by a shrewd and resourceful enemy with all england he knew the utter contempt in which henry held the terms of the magna charta which he so often violated along with his kingly oath to maintain it but what all england did not know de vac had gleaned from scraps of conversation dropped in the armory that henry was even now negotiating with the leaders of foreign mercenaries and with louis ix of france for a sufficient force of knights and men at arms to wage a relentless w

grew intenser focused itself as it were in a narrower snout mr hutton made a cinquecento gesture and kissed her extended hand it was the first time he had done such a thing the action seemed not to be

of the drive i ll come and see you off no no mr hutton was playful but determined you must do no such thing i simply forbid you but i should like to come miss spence protested throwing a rapid gioconda at him mr hutton held up his hand no he repeated and then with a gesture that was almost the blowing of a kiss he started to run down the drive lightly on his toes with long bounding strides like a boy s he was proud of that run it was quite marvellously youthful still he was glad the drive was no longer at the last bend before passing out of sight of the house he halted and turned round miss spence was still standing on the steps smiling her smile he waved his hand and this time quite definitely and overtly wafted a kiss in her direction then breaking once more into his magnificent canter he rounded the last dark promontory of trees once out of sight of the house he let his high paces decline to a trot and finally to a walk he took out his handkerchief and began wiping his neck inside his collar what fools what fools had there ever been such an ass as poor dear janet spence never unless it was himself decidedly he was the more malignant fool since he at least was aware of his folly and still persisted in it why did he persist ah the problem that was himself the problem that was other people he had reached the gate a large prosperous looking motor was standing at the side of the road home m nab the chauffeur touched his cap and stop at the cross roads on the way as usual mr hutton added as he opened the door of the car well he said speaking into the obscurity that

jeeves at any rate for the last five years he has been living at this place of his down in lincolnshire as confirmed a species shunning hermit as ever put fresh water in the tank every second day and refused to see a soul that s why i was so amazed when you told me he had suddenly risen to the surface like this i still can t believe it i am inclined to think that there must be some mistake and that this bird who has been calling here is some different variety of fink nottle the chap i know wears horn rimmed spectacles and has a face like a fish how does that check up with your data the gentleman who came to the flat wore horn rimmed spectacles sir and looked like something on a slab possibly there was a certain suggestion of the piscine sir then it must be gussie i suppose but what on earth can have brought him up to london i am in a position to explain that sir mr fink nottle confided to me his motive in visiting the metropolis he came because the young lady is here young lady yes sir you don t mean he s in love yes sir well i m dashed i m really dashed i positively am dashed jeeves and i was too i mean to say a joke s a joke but there are limits then i found my mind turning to another aspect of this rummy affair conceding the fact that gussie fink nottle against all the ruling of the form book might have fallen in love why should he have been haunting my flat like this no doubt the occasion was one of those when a fellow needs a friend but i couldn t see what had made him pick on me it wasn t as if he and i were in any way bosom we had seen a lot of each other at one time of course but in the last two years i hadn t had so much as a post card from him i put all this to jeeves odd his coming to me still if he did he did no argument about that it must have been a nasty jar for the poor perisher when he found i wasn t here no sir mr fink nottle did not call to see you sir pull yourself together jeeves you ve just told me that this is what he has been doing and assiduously at that it was i with whom he was desirous of establishing communication sir you but i didn t know you had ever met him i had not had that pleasure until he called here sir but it appears that mr sipperley a fellow student of whom mr fink nottle had been at the university recommended him to place his affairs in my hands the mystery had conked i saw all as i dare say you know jeeves s reputation as a counsellor has long been established among the cognoscenti and the first move of any of my little circle on discovering themselves in any form of soup is always to roll round and put the thing up to him and when he s got a out of a bad spot a puts b on to him and then when he has fixed up b b sends c along and so on if you get my drift and so forth that s how these big consulting practices like jeeves s grow old sippy i knew had been deeply impressed by the man s efforts on his behalf at the time when he was trying to get engaged to elizabeth moon so it was not to be wondered at that he should have advised gussie to apply pure routine you might say oh you re acting for him are you yes sir now i follow now i understand and what is gussie s trouble oddly enough sir precisely the same as that of mr sipperley when i was enabled to be of assistance to him no doubt you recall mr sipperley s predicament sir deeply attached to miss moon he suffered from a rooted diffidence which made it impossible for him to speak i nodded i remember yes i recall the sipperley case he couldn t bring himself to the scratch a marked coldness of the feet was there not i recollect you saying he was letting what was it letting something do something cats entered into it if i am not mistaken letting i dare not wait upon i would sir that s right but how about the cats like the poor cat i the adage sir exactly it beats me how you think up these things and gussie you say is in the same posish yes sir each time he endeavours to formulate a proposal of marriage his courage fails him and yet if he wants this female to be his wife he s got to say so what i mean only civil to mention it precisely sir i mused well i suppose this was inevitable jeeves i wouldn t have thought that this fink nottle would ever have fallen a victim to the divine p but if he has no wonder he finds the going sticky yes sir look at the life he s led yes sir i don t suppose he has spoken to a girl for years what a lesson this is to us jeeves not to shut ourselves up in country houses and stare into glass tanks you can t be the dominant male if you do that sort of thing in this life you can choose between two courses you can either shut yourself up in a country house and stare into tanks or you can be a dasher with the sex you can t do both no sir i mused once more gussie and i as i say had rather lost touch but all the same i was exercised about the poor fish as i am about all my pals close or distant who find themselves treading upon life s banana skins it seemed to me that he was up against it i threw my mind back to the last time i had seen him about two years ago it had been i had looked in at his place while on a motor trip and he had put me right off my feed by

again is a form of impression that recurs again and again at cleveland i felt a distinct note of optimism in the air this same note of optimism is found also at toledo at toronto in short i believe it indicates nothing more than that some one gave the visitor a cigar indeed it generally occurs during the familiar scene in which the visitor describes his cordial reception in an unsuspecting american town thus i was met at the station called in america the depot by a member of the municipal council driving his own motor car after giving me an excellent cigar he proceeded to drive me about the town to various points of interest including the municipal abattoir where he gave me another excellent cigar the carnegie public library the first national bank the courteous manager of which gave me an excellent cigar and the second congregational church where i had the pleasure of meeting the pastor the pastor who appeared a man of breadth and culture gave me another cigar in the evening a dinner admirably cooked and excellently served was tendered to me at a leading hotel and of course he took it after which his statement that he carried away from the town a feeling of optimism explains itself he had four cigars the dinner and half a page of impressions at twenty cents a word nor is it only by the theft of impressions that we suffer at the hands of these english discoverers of america it is a part of the system also that we have to submit to being lectured to by our talented visitors it is now quite understood that as soon as an english literary man finishes a book he is rushed across to america to tell the people of the united states and canada all about it and how he came to write it at home in his own country they don t care how he came to write it he s written it and that s enough but in america it is different one month after the distinguished author s book on the boyhood of botticelli has appeared in london he is seen to land in new york very quietly out of one of the back portholes of the olympic that same afternoon you will find him in an armchair in one of the big hotels giving off impressions of america to a group of reporters after which notices appear in all the papers to the effect that he will lecture in carnegie hall on botticelli the boy the audience is assured beforehand it consists of all the people who feel that they have to go because they know all about botticelli and all the people who feel that they have to go because they don t know anything about botticelli by this means the lecturer is able to rake the whole country from montreal to san francisco with botticelli the boy then he turns round labels his lecture botticelli the man and rakes it all back again all the way across the continent and back he emits impressions estimates of national character and surveys of american genius he sails from new york in a blaze of publicity with his cordon of reporters round him and a month later publishes his book america as i saw it it is widely read in america in the course of time a very considerable public feeling was aroused in the united states and canada over this state of affairs the lack of reciprocity in it seemed unfair it was felt or at least i felt that the time had come when some one ought to go over and take some impressions off england the choice of such a person my choice fell upon myself by an arrangement with the geographical society of america acting in conjunction with the royal geographical society of england to both of whom i communicated my proposal i went at my own expense it is scarcely feasible to give here full details in regard to my outfit and equipment though i hope to do so in a later and more extended account of my expedition suffice it to say that my outfit which was modelled on the equipment of english lecturers in america included a complete suit of clothes a dress shirt for lecturing in a fountain pen and a silk hat the dress shirt i may say for the benefit of other travellers proved invaluable the silk hat however is no longer used in england except perhaps for scrambling eggs in i pass over the details of my pleasant voyage from new york to liverpool during the last fifty years so many travellers have made the voyage across the atlantic that it is now impossible to obtain any impressions from the ocean of the slightest commercial value

enough to eat though i am thankful to say that i never have had to do that but to hunt others just for the fun of hunting is something i cannot understand at all and yet that is what men seem to do it for i guess the trouble is they never have been hunted themselves and don t know how it feels sometimes i think i ll hunt one some day just to teach him a lesson what are you laughing at peter at the idea of you hunting a man replied peter your heart is all right lightfoot but you are too timid and gentle to frighten any one big as you are i wouldn t fear you with a single swift bound lightfoot sprang out in front of peter he stamped his sharp hoofs lowered his handsome head until the sharp points of his antlers which people call horns pointed straight at peter lifted the hair along the back of his neck and made a motion as if to plunge at him his eyes which peter had always thought so soft and gentle seemed to flash fire oh cried peter in a faint frightened sounding voice and leaped to one side before it entered his foolish little head that lightfoot was just pretending lightfoot chuckled did you say i couldn t frighten any one he demanded i i didn t know you could look so terribly fierce stammered peter those antlers look really dangerous when you point them that way why why what is that hanging to them it looks like bits of old fur have you been tearing somebody s coat lightfoot peter s eyes were wide with wonder and suspicion chapter ii lightfoot s new antlers peter rabbit was puzzled he stared at lightfoot the deer a wee bit suspiciously have you been tearing somebody s coat he asked again he didn t like to think it of lightfoot whom he always had believed quite as gentle harmless and timid as himself but what else could he think lightfoot slowly shook his head no said he i haven t torn anybody s coat then what are those rags hanging on your antlers demanded peter lightfoot chuckled they are what is left of the coverings of my new antlers he explained what s that what do you mean by new antlers peter was sitting up very straight with his eyes fixed on lightfoot s antlers as though he never had seen them before just what i said retorted lightfoot what do you think of them i think they are the finest antlers i ve ever had when i get the rest of those rags off they will be as handsome a set as ever was grown in the green forest lightfoot rubbed his antlers against the trunk of a tree till some of the rags hanging to them dropped off peter blinked very hard he was trying to understand and he couldn t finally he said so what kind of a story are you trying to fill me up with he demanded indignantly do you mean to tell me that those are not the antlers that you have had as long as i ve known you how can anything hard like those antlers grow and if those are new ones where are the old ones show me the old ones and perhaps i ll believe that these are new ones the idea of trying to make me believe that antlers grow just like plants i ve seen bossy the cow all summer and i know she has got the same horns she had last summer new antlers indeed you are quite right peter quite right about bossy the cow she never has new horns but that isn t any reason why i shouldn t have new antlers is it replied lightfoot patiently her horns are quite different from my antlers i have a new pair every year you haven t seen me all summer have you peter no i don t remember that i have replied peter trying very hard to remember when he had last seen lightfoot i know you haven t retorted lightfoot i know it because i have been hiding in a place you never visit what have you been hiding for demanded peter for my new antlers to grow replied lightfoot when my new antlers are growing i want to be away by myself i don t like to be seen without them or with half grown ones besides i am very uncomfortable while the new antlers are growing and i want to be alone lightfoot spoke as if he really meant every word he said but still peter couldn t he just couldn t believe that those wonderful great antlers had grown out of lightfoot s head in a single summer where did you leave your old ones and when did they come off he asked and there was doubt in the very tone of his voice they dropped off last spring but i don t remember just where replied lightfoot i was too glad to be rid of them to notice where they dropped you see they were loose and uncomfortable and i hadn t any more use for them because i knew that my new ones would be bigger and better i ve got one more point on each than i had last year lightfoot began once more to rub his antlers against the tree to get off the queer rags hanging to them and to polish the points peter watched in silence for a few minutes then all his suspicions returning he said but you haven t told me anything about those rags hanging to your antlers and you haven t believed what i have already told you retorted lightfoot i don t like telling things to people who won t believe me chapter iii lightfoot tells how his antlers grew it is hard to believe what seems impossible and yet what seems impossible to you may be a very commonplace matter to some one else so it does not do to say that a thing cannot be possible just because you cannot understand how it can be peter rabbit wanted to believe what lightfoot the deer had just told him but somehow he couldn t if he had seen those antlers growing it would have been another matter but he hadn t seen lightfoot since the very last of winter and then lightfoot had worn just such handsome antlers as he now had so peter really couldn t be blamed for not being able to believe that those old ones had been lost and in their pla

jeeves at any rate for the last five years he has been living at this place of his down in lincolnshire as confirmed a species shunning hermit as ever put fresh water in the tank every second day and refused to see a soul that s why i was so amazed when you told me he had suddenly risen to the surface like this i still can t believe it i am inclined to think that there must be some mistake and that this bird who has been calling here is some different variety of fink nottle the chap i know wears horn rimmed spectacles and has a face like a fish how does that check up with your data the gentleman who came to the flat wore horn rimmed spectacles sir and looked like something on a slab possibly there was a certain suggestion of the piscine sir then it must be gussie i suppose but what on earth can have brought him up to london i am in a position to explain that sir mr fink nottle confided to me his motive in visiting the metropolis he came because the young lady is here young lady yes sir you don t mean he s in love yes sir well i m dashed i m really dashed i positively am dashed jeeves and i was too i mean to say a joke s a joke but there are limits then i found my mind turning to another aspect of this rummy affair conceding the fact that gussie fink nottle against all the ruling of the form book might have fallen in love why should he have been haunting my flat like this no doubt the occasion was one of those when a fellow needs a friend but i couldn t see what had made him pick on me it wasn t as if he and i were in any way bosom we had seen a lot of each other at one time of course but in the last two years i hadn t had so much as a post card from him i put all this to jeeves odd his coming to me still if he did he did no argument about that it must have been a nasty jar for the poor perisher when he found i wasn t here no sir mr fink nottle did not call to see you sir pull yourself together jeeves you ve just told me that this is what he has been doing and assiduously at that it was i with whom he was desirous of establishing communication sir you but i didn t know you had ever met him i had not had that pleasure until he called here sir but it appears that mr sipperley a fellow student of whom mr fink nottle had been at the university recommended him to place his affairs in my hands the mystery had conked i saw all as i dare say you know jeeves s reputation as a counsellor has long been established among the cognoscenti and the first move of any of my little circle on discovering themselves in any form of soup is always to roll

big consulting practices like jeeves s grow old sippy i knew had been deeply impressed by the man s efforts on his behalf at the time when he was trying to get engaged to elizabeth moon so it was not to be wondered at that he should have advised gussie to apply pure routine you might say oh you re acting for him are you yes sir now i follow now i understand and what is gussie s trouble oddly enough sir precisely the same as that of mr sipperley when i was enabled to be of assistance to him no doubt you recall mr sipperley s predicament sir deeply attached to miss moon he suffered from a rooted diffidence which made it impossible for him to speak i nodded i remember yes i recall the sipperley case he couldn t bring himself to the scratch a marked coldness of the feet was there not i recollect you saying he was letting what was it letting something do something cats entered into it if i am not mistaken letting i dare not wait upon i would sir that s right but how about the cats like the poor cat i the adage sir exactly it beats me how you think up these things and gussie you say is in the same posish yes sir each time he endeavours to formulate a proposal of marriage his courage fails him and yet if he wants this female to be his wife he s got to say so what i mean only civil to mention it precisely sir i mused well i suppose this was inevitable jeeves i wouldn t have thought that this fink nottle would ever have fallen a victim to the divine p but if he has no wonder he finds the going sticky yes sir look at the life he s led yes sir i don t suppose he has spoken to a girl for years what a lesson this is to us jeeves not to shut ourselves up in country houses and stare into glass tanks you can t be the dominant male if you do that sort of thing in this life you can choose between two courses you can either shut yourself up in a country house and stare into tanks or you can be a dasher with the sex you can t do both no sir i mused once more gussie and i

was seven years old large for his age a bold handsome lad with red hair mrs smith made a bargain with dick and led him back with her here panhandle took violent exception to having his pets killed or routed out by this boy he had never before seen he did not like his looks anyway but dick paid little heed to panhandle except once when mrs smith went into the house and then he knocked panhandle down for once panhandle did not squall he got up round eyed pale with his hands clenched he never said a word something was born in the depths of his gentle soul then dick tore a hole in the little wall of rocks that supported the porch and with a lighted torch on a stick he wormed his way in to rout out the skunks panhandle suddenly was thrilled and frightened by a bellowing from dick the boy came hurriedly backing out of the hole he fetched an odor with him that nearly suffocated panhandle so strange and raw and terrible was it dick s eyes were shut for the time being he had been blinded he bounced around like a chicken with its head cut off bawling wildly what had happened panhandle did not know but it certainly suited him goody goody he shouted holding his nose and edging away from the lad then panhandle saw smoke issuing from the hole under the porch the mother skunk and her kittens scampered out into the weeds he heard the crackle of flames that boy had dropped his torch under the porch screaming panhandle ran to alarm his mother but it was too late there were no men near at hand so nothing could be done panhandle stood crying beside his mother watching their little home burn to the ground somehow in his mind the boy dick had been to blame panhandle peered round to find him but he was gone never would panhandle forget that boy they walked to the uncle s house and spent the night there soon another home was under construction on the same site it was more of a shack than a house for building materials were scarce and the near approach of winter made hasty construction imperative winter came soon and panhandle and his mother were alone it was cold and they huddled over the little wood fire they had plenty to eat but were very uncomfortable in the one room shack bill smith came home but seldom that fall the valley had been overrun with homesteaders nesters they were called and these newcomers passed by often from the town drunk and rough panhandle used to lie awake a good deal during these lonely hours the moan of the prairie wind the mourn of wolves and yelp of coyotes became part of his existence he understood why his mother barred and blocked the one door placed the ax by the bed and the gun under her pillow even then he longed for the time when he would be old and big enough to protect her the lonely winter with its innumerable hours of solitude for mrs smith and the boy had incalculable influence upon his character she taught him much ways and things words and feelings that became an integral part of his life at last the long winter ended with spring came the gales of wind which though no longer cold were terrible in their violence many a night panhandle lay awake shrinking beside his mother fearing the shack would blow away over their heads many a day the sun was obscured and nothing could be cooked no work done while the dust storm raged as spring advanced with a lessening of the tornadoes a new and fascinating game came into panhandle s life it was to sit at the one little window and watch the cowboys ride by how he came to worship them they were on their way to the spring roundups his father had told him all about them panhandle would strain his eyes to get a first glimpse of them to count the shaggy prancing horses the lithe supple riders with their great sombreros their bright scarfs guns and chaps and boots and spurs their lassos how they fascinated panhandle ropes to whirl and throw at a running steer that was a game he resolved to play when he grew up and his mother discovering his interest made him a little reata and taught him how to throw it how to make loops and knots she told him how her people had owned horses thrown lassos run cattle panhandle was always watching for the cowboys when they passed by he would run to the other side of the shack where there was a knothole stuffed with a rag and through this he would peep until he was blinded by dust these were full days for the lad rousing in him wonder and awe eagerness and fear strange longings for he knew not what then one day his father brought home a black pony with three white feet and a white spot on his face panhandle was in rapture for him he could have burst for very joy but he could not speak it developed that his mother would not let him ride the pony except when she led it this roused as great a grief as possession was joy a beautiful little pony he could not ride ideas formed in his mind scintillated and grew into dark purpose one day he stole curly and led him out of sight behind the barn and mounting him rode down to the spring panhandle found himself alone he was free he was on the back of a horse mighty and incalculable fact curly felt the spirit of that occasion after drinking at the spring he broke into a lope panhandle stuck on somehow and turned the pony toward the house curly loped faster panhandle felt the wind in his hair he bounced up and down squealing with delight he twisted his hands in the flowing mane and held on at the top of the hill his joy became divided by fear curly kept on loping down the hill toward the house faster and faster panhandle bounced higher and higher up on his neck back on his haunches until suddenly his hold broke and he was thrown down

have awkward consequences darwin was given an imposing reputation as not only an evolutionist but as the evolutionist with the immense majority who never read his books the few who never read any others were led by them to concentrate exclusively on circumstantial selection as the explanation of all the transformations and adaptations which were the evidence for evolution and they presently found themselves so cut off by this specialization from the majority who knew darwin only by his spurious reputation that they were obliged to distinguish themselves not as darwinians but as neo darwinians before ten more years had elapsed the neo darwinians were practically running current science it was i was fifty i published my own view of evolution in a play called man and superman and i found that most people were unable to understand how i could be an evolutionist and not a neo darwinian or why i habitually derided neo darwinism as a ghastly idiocy and would fall on its professors slaughterously in public discussions it was in the hope of making me clear the matter up that the fabian society which was then organizing a series of lectures on prophets of the nineteenth century asked me to deliver a lecture on the prophet darwin i did so and scraps of that lecture which was never published variegate these pages political inadequacy of the human animal ten more years elapsed neo darwinism in politics had produced a european catastrophe of a magnitude so appalling and a scope so unpredictable that as i write these lines in it is still far from certain whether our civilization will survive it the circumstances of this catastrophe the boyish cinema fed romanticism which made it possible to impose it on the people as a crusade and especially the ignorance and errors of the victors of western europe when its violent phase had passed and the time for reconstruction arrived confirmed a doubt which had grown steadily in my mind during my forty years public work as a socialist namely whether the human animal as he exists at present is capable of solving the social problems raised by his own aggregation or as he calls it his civilization cowardice of the irreligious another observation i had made was that goodnatured unambitious men are cowards when they have no religion they are dominated and exploited not only by greedy and often half witted and half alive weaklings who will do anything for cigars champagne motor cars and the more childish and selfish uses of money but by able and sound administrators who can do nothing else with them than dominate and exploit them government and exploitation become synonymous under such circumstances and the world is finally ruled by the childish the brigands and the blackguards those who refuse to

of europe having knocked the other half down is trying to kick it to death and may succeed a procedure which is logically sound neo darwinism and the goodnatured majority are looking on in helpless horror or allowing themselves to be persuaded by the newspapers of their exploiters that the kicking is not only a sound commercial investment but an act of divine justice of which they are the ardent instruments but if man is really incapable of organizing a big civilization and cannot organize even a village or a tribe any too well what is the use of giving him a religion a religion may make him hunger and thirst for righteousness but will it endow him with the practical capacity to satisfy that appetite good intentions do not carry with them a grain of political science which is a very complicated one the most devoted and indefatigable the most able and disinterested students of this science in england as far as i know are my friends sidney and beatrice webb it has taken them forty years of preliminary work in the course of which they have published several treatises comparable to adam smith s wealth of nations to formulate a political constitution adequate to existing needs if this is the measure of what can be done in a lifetime by extraordinary ability keen natural aptitude exceptional opportunities and freedom from the preoccupations of bread winning what are we to expect from the parliament man to whom political science is as remote and distasteful as the differential calculus and to whom such an elementary but vital point as the law of economic rent is a pons asinorum never to be approached much less crossed or from the common voter who is mostly so hard at work all day earning a living that he cannot keep awake for five minutes over a book is there any hope in education the usual answer is that we must educate our masters that is ourselves we must teach citizenship and political science at school but must we there is no must about it the hard fact being that we must not teach political science or citizenship at school the schoolmaster who attempted it would soon find himself penniless in the streets without pupils if not in the dock pleading to a pompously worded indictment for sedition against the exploiters our schools teach the morality of feudalism corrupted by commercialism and hold up the military conqueror the robber baron and the profiteer as models of the illustrious and the successful in vain do the prophets who see through this imposture preach and teach a better gospel the individuals whom they convert are doomed to pass away in a few years and the new generations are dragged back in the schools to the morality of the fifteenth century and think themselves liberal when they are defending the ideas of henry vii and gentlemanly when they are opposing to them

tiny graciousness in short of weeness but compare this new york according to another discoverer of america gave me an impression of size of vastness there seemed to be a big ness about it not found in smaller places a third visitor writes new york struck me as hard cruel almost inhuman this i think was because his taxi driver had charged him three dollars the first thing that struck me in new york writes another was the statue of liberty but after all that was only natural it was the first thing that could reach him nor is it only the impressions of the metropolis that seem to fall short of reality let me quote a few others taken at random here and there over the continent i took from pittsburg says an english visitor an impression of something that i could hardly define an atmosphere rather than an idea all very well but after all had he the right to take it granted that pittsburg has an atmosphere rather than an idea the attempt to carry away this atmosphere surely borders on rapacity new orleans writes another visitor opened her arms to me and bestowed upon me the soft and languorous kiss of the caribbean this statement may or may not be true but in any case it hardly seems the fair thing to mention it chicago according to another book of discovery struck me as a large city situated as it is and where it is it seems destined to be a place of importance or here again is a form of impression that recurs again and again at cleveland i felt a distinct note of optimism in the air this same note of optimism is found also at toledo at toronto in short i believe it indicates nothing more than that some one gave the visitor a cigar indeed it generally occurs during the familiar scene in which the visitor describes his cordial reception in an unsuspecting american town thus i was met at the station called in america the depot by a member of the municipal council driving his own motor car after giving me an excellent cigar he proceeded to drive me about the town to various points of interest including the municipal abattoir where he gave me another excellent cigar the carnegie public library the first national bank the courteous manager of which gave me an excellent cigar and the second congregational church where i had the pleasure of meeting the pastor the pastor who appeared a man of breadth and culture gave me another cigar in the evening a dinner admirably cooked and excellently served was tendered to me at a leading hotel and of course he took it after which his statement that he carried away from the town a feeling of optimism explains itself he had four cigars the dinner and half a page of impressions at twenty cents a word nor is it only by the theft of impressions that we suffer at the hands of these english discoverers of america it is a part of the system also that we have to submit to being lectured to by our talented visitors it is now quite understood that as soon as an english literary man finishes a book he is rushed across to america to tell the people of the united states and canada all about it and how he came to write it at home in his own country they don t care how he came to write it he s written it and that s enough but in america it is different one month after the distinguished author s book on the boyhood of botticelli has appeared in london he is seen to land in new york very quietly out of one of the back portholes of the olympic that same afternoon you will find him in an armchair in one of the big hotels giving off impressions of america to a group of reporters after which notices appear in all the papers to the effect that he will lecture in carnegie hall on botticelli the boy the audience is assured beforehand it consists of all the people who feel that they have to go because they know all about botticelli and all the people who feel that they have to go because they don t know anything about botticelli by this means the lecturer is able to rake the whole country from montreal to san francisco with botticelli the boy then he turns round labels his lecture botticelli the man and rakes it all back again all the way across the continent and back he emits impressions estimates of national character and surveys of american genius he sails from new york in a blaze of publicity with his cordon of reporters round him and a month later publishes his book america as i saw it it is widely read in america in the course of time a very considerable public feeling was aroused in the united states and canada over this state of affairs the lack of reciprocity in it seemed unfair it was felt or at least i felt that the time had come when some one ought to go over and take some impressions off england the choice of such a person my choice fell upon myself by an arrangement with the geographical society of america acting in conjunction with the royal geographical society of england to both of whom i communicated my proposal i went at my own expense it is scarcely feasible to give here full details in regard to my outfit and equipment though i hope to do so in a later and more extended account of my expedition suffice it to say that my outfit which was modelled on the equipment of english lecturers in america included a complete suit of clothes a dress shirt for lecturing in a fountain pen and a silk hat the dress shirt i may say for the benefit of other travellers proved invaluable the silk hat however is no longer used in england except perhaps for scrambling eggs in i pass over the details of my pleasant voyage from new york to liverpool during the last fifty years so many travellers have made the voyage across the atlantic that it is now impossible to obtain any impressions from the ocean of the slightest commercial value

sense enough to see that ideas exist and eugenics itself in large quantities or small coming quickly or coming slowly urged from good motives or bad applied to a thousand people or applied to three eugenics itself is a thing no more to be bargained about than poisoning it is not really difficult to sum up the essence of eugenics though some of the eugenists seem to be rather vague about it the movement consists of two parts a moral basis which is common to all and a scheme of social application which varies a good deal for the moral basis it is obvious that man s ethical responsibility varies with his knowledge of consequences if i were in charge of a baby like dr johnson in that tower of vision and if the baby was ill through having eaten the soap i might possibly send for a doctor i might be calling him away from much more serious cases from the bedsides of babies whose diet had been far more deadly but i should be justified i could not be expected to know enough about his other patients to be obliged or even entitled to sacrifice to them the baby for whom i was primarily and directly responsible now the eugenic moral basis is this that the baby for whom we are primarily and directly responsible is the babe unborn that is that we know or may come to know enough of certain inevitable tendencies in biology to consider the fruit of some contemplated union in that direct and clear light of conscience which we can now only fix on the other partner in that union the one duty can conceivably be as definite as or more definite than the other the baby that does not exist can be considered even before the wife who does now it is essential to grasp that this is a comparatively new note in morality of course sane people always thought the aim of marriage was the procreation of children to the glory of god or according to the plan of nature but whether they counted such children as god s reward for service or nature s premium on sanity they always left the reward to god or the premium to nature as a less definable thing the only person and this is the point towards whom one could have precise duties was the partner in the process directly considering the partner s claims was the nearest one could get to indirectly considering the claims of posterity if the women of the harem sang praises of the hero as the moslem mounted his horse it was because this was the due of a man if the christian knight helped his wife off her horse it was because this was the due of a woman definite and detailed dues of this kind they did not predicate of the babe unborn regarding him in that agnostic and opportunist light in which mr browdie regarded the hypothetical child of miss squeers thinking these sex relations healthy they naturally hoped they would produce healthy children but that was all the moslem woman doubtless expected allah to send beautiful sons to an obedient wife but she would not have allowed any direct vision of such sons to alter the obedience itself she would not have said i will now be a disobedient wife as the learned leech informs me that great prophets are often the children of disobedient wives the knight doubtless hoped that the saints would help him to strong children if he did all the duties of his station one of which might be helping his wife off her horse but he would not have refrained from doing this because he had read in a book that a course of falling off horses often resulted in the birth of a genius both moslem and christian would have thought such speculations not only impious but utterly unpractical i quite agree with them but that is not the point here the point here is that a new school believes eugenics against ethics and it is proved by one familiar fact that the heroisms of history are actually the crimes of eugenics the eugenists books and articles are full of suggestions that non eugenic unions should and may come to be regarded as we regard sins that we should really feel that marrying an invalid is a kind of cruelty to children but history is full of the praises of people who have held sacred such ties to invalids of cases like those of colonel hutchinson and sir william temple who remained faithful to betrothals when beauty and health had been apparently blasted and though the illnesses of dorothy osborne and mrs hutchinson may not fall under the eugenic speculations i do not know it is obvious that they might have done so and certainly it would not have made any difference to men s moral opinion of the act i do not discuss here which morality i favour but i insist that they are opposite the eugenist really sets up as saints the very men whom hundreds of families have called sneaks to be consistent they ought to put up statues to the men who deserted their loves because of bodily misfortune with inscriptions celebrating the good eugenist who on his fianc e falling off a bicycle nobly refused to marry her or to the young hero who on hearing of an uncle with erysipelas magnanimously broke his word what is perfectly plain is this that mankind have hitherto held the bond between man and woman so sacred and the effect of it on the children so incalculable that they have always admired the maintenance of honour more than the maintenance of safety doubtless they thought that even the children might be none the worse for not being the children of cowards and shirkers but this was not the first thought the first commandment briefly we may say that while many moral systems have set restraints on sex almost as severe as any eugenist could set they have almost always had the character of securing the fidelity of the two sexes to each other and leaving the rest to god to introduce an ethic which makes that fidelity or infidelity vary with some calculation about heredity is that rarest of all t

emotions and will xv characteristics of mental phenomena the analysis of mind lecture i recent criticisms of consciousness there are certain occurrences which we are in the habit of calling mental among these we may take as typical believing and desiring the exact definition of the word mental will i hope emerge as the lectures proceed for the present i shall mean by it whatever occurrences would commonly be called mental i wish in these lectures to analyse as fully as i can what it is that really takes place when we e g believe or desire in this first lecture i shall be concerned to refute a theory which is widely held and which i formerly held myself the theory that the essence of everything mental is a certain quite peculiar something called consciousness conceived either as a relation to objects or as a pervading quality of psychical phenomena the reasons which i shall give against this theory will be mainly derived from previous authors there are two sorts of reasons which will divide my lecture into two parts direct reasons derived from analysis and its difficulties indirect reasons derived from observation of animals comparative psychology and of the insane and hysterical psycho analysis few things are more firmly established in popular philosophy than the distinction between mind and matter those who are not professional metaphysicians are willing to confess that they do not know what mind actually is or how matter is constituted but they remain convinced that there is an impassable gulf between the two and that both belong to what actually exists in the world philosophers on the other hand have maintained often that matter is a mere fiction imagined by mind and sometimes that mind is a mere property of a certain kind of matter those who maintain that mind is the reality and matter an evil dream are called idealists a word which has a different meaning in philosophy from that which it bears in ordinary life those who argue that matter is the reality and mind a mere property of protoplasm are called materialists they have been rare among philosophers but common at certain periods among men of science idealists materialists and ordinary mortals have been in agreement on one point that they knew sufficiently what they meant by the words mind and matter to be able to conduct their debate intelligently yet it was just in this point as to which they were at one that they seem to me to have been all alike in error the stuff of which the world of our experience is composed is in my belief neither mind nor matter but something more primitive than either both mind and matter seem to be composite and the stuff of which they are compounded lies in a sense between the two in a sense above them both like a common ancestor as regards matter i have set forth my reasons for this view on former occasions and i shall not now repeat them but the question of mind is more difficult and it is this question that i propose to discuss in these lectures a great deal of what i shall have to say is not original indeed much recent work in various fields has tended to show the necessity of such theories as those which i shall be advocating accordingly in this first lecture i shall try to give a brief description of the systems of ideas within which our investigation is to be carried on our knowledge of the external world allen unwin chapters iii and iv also mysticism and logic essays vii and viii if there is one thing that may be said in the popular estimation to characterize mind that one thing is consciousness we say that we are conscious of what we see and hear of what we remember and of our own thoughts and feelings most of us believe that tables and chairs are not conscious we think that when we sit in a chair we are aware of sitting in it but it is not aware of being sat in it cannot for a moment be doubted that we are right in believing that there is some difference between us and the chair in this respect so much may be taken as fact and as a datum for our inquiry but as soon as we try to say what exactly the difference is we become involved in perplexities is consciousness ultimate and simple something to be merely accepted and contemplated or is it something complex perhaps consisting in our way of behaving in the presence of objects or alternatively in the existence in us of things called ideas having a certain relation to objects though different from them and only symbolically representative of them such questions are not easy to answer but until they are answered we cannot profess to know what we mean by saying that we are possessed of consciousness before considering modern theories let us look first at consciousness from the standpoint of conventional psychology since this embodies views which naturally occur when we begin to reflect upon the subject for this purpose let us as a preliminary consider different ways of being conscious first there is the way of perception we perceive tables and chairs horses and dogs our friends traffic passing in the street in short anything which we recognize through the senses i leave on one side for the present the question whether pure sensation is to be regarded as a form of consciousness what i am speaking of now is perception where according to conventional psychology we go beyond the sensation to the thing which it represents when you hear a donkey bray you not only hear a noise but realize that it comes from a donkey when you see a table you not only see a coloured surface but realize that it is hard the addition of these elements that go beyond crude sensation is said to constitute perception we shall have more to say about this at a later stage for the moment i am merely

enough to eat though i am thankful to say that i never have had to do that but to hunt others just for the fun of hunting is something i cannot understand at all and yet that is what men seem to do it for i guess the trouble is they never have been hunted themselves and don t know how it feels sometimes i think i ll hunt one some day just to teach him a lesson what are you laughing at peter at the idea of you hunting a man replied peter your heart is all right lightfoot but you are too timid and gentle to frighten any one big as you are i wouldn t fear you with a single swift bound lightfoot sprang out in front of peter he stamped his sharp hoofs lowered his handsome head until the sharp points of his antlers which people call horns pointed straight at peter lifted the hair along the back of his neck and made a motion as if to plunge at him his eyes which peter had always thought so soft and gentle seemed to flash fire oh cried peter in a faint frightened sounding voice and leaped to one side before it entered his foolish little head that lightfoot was just pretending lightfoot chuckled did you say i couldn t frighten any one he demanded i i didn t know you could look so terribly fierce stammered peter those antlers look really dangerous when you point them that way why why what is that hanging to them it looks like bits of old fur have you been tearing somebody s coat lightfoot peter s eyes were wide with wonder and suspicion chapter ii lightfoot s new antlers peter rabbit was puzzled he stared at lightfoot the deer a wee bit suspiciously have you been tearing somebody s coat he asked again he didn t like to think it of lightfoot whom he always had believed quite as gentle harmless and timid as himself but what else could he think lightfoot slowly shook his head no said he i haven t torn anybody s coat then what are those rags hanging on your antlers demanded peter lightfoot chuckled they are what is left of the coverings of my new antlers he explained what s that what do you mean by new antlers peter was sitting up very straight with his eyes fixed on lightfoot s antlers as though he never had seen them before just what i said retorted lightfoot what do you think of them i think they are the finest antlers i ve ever had when i get the rest of those rags off they will be as handsome a set as ever was grown in the green forest lightfoot rubbed his antlers against the trunk of a tree till some of the rags hanging to them dropped off peter blinked very hard he was trying to understand and he couldn t finally he said so what kind of a story are you trying to fill me up with he demanded indignantly do you mean to tell me that those are not the antlers that you have had as long as i ve known you how can anything hard like those antlers grow and if those are new ones where are the old ones show me the old ones and perhaps i ll believe that these are new ones the idea of trying to make me believe that antlers grow just like plants i ve seen bossy the cow all summer and i know she has got the same horns she had last summer new antlers indeed you are quite right peter quite right about bossy the cow she never has new horns but that isn t any reason why i shouldn t have new antlers is it replied lightfoot patiently her horns are quite different from my antlers i have a new pair every year you haven t seen me all summer have you peter no i don t remember that i have replied peter trying very hard to remember when he had last seen lightfoot i know you haven t retorted lightfoot i know it because i have been hiding in a place you never visit what have you been hiding for demanded peter for my new antlers to grow replied lightfoot when my new antlers are growing i want to be away by myself i don t like to be seen without them or with half grown ones besides i am very uncomfortable while the new antlers are growing and i want to be alone lightfoot spoke as if he really meant every word he said but still peter couldn t he just couldn t believe that those wonderful great antlers had grown out of lightfoot s head in a single summer where did you leave your old ones and when did they come off he asked and there was doubt in the very tone of his voice they dropped off last spring but i don t remember just where replied lightfoot i was too glad to be rid of them to notice where they dropped you see they were loose and uncomfortable and i hadn t any more use for them because i knew that my new ones would be bigger and better i ve got one more point on each than i had last year lightfoot began once more to rub his antlers against the tree to get off the queer rags hanging to them and to polish the points peter watched in silence for a few minutes then all his suspicions returning he said but you haven t told me anything about those rags hanging to your antlers and you haven t believed what i have already told you retorted lightfoot i don t like telling things to people who won t believe me chapter iii lightfoot tells how his antlers grew it is hard to believe what seems impossible and yet what seems impossible to you may be a very commonplace matter to some one else so it does not do to say that a thing cannot be possible just because you cannot understand how it can be peter rabbit wanted to believe what lightfoot the deer had just told him but somehow he couldn t if he had seen those antlers growing it would have been another matter but he hadn t seen lightfoot since the very last of winter and then lightfoot had worn just such handsome antlers as he now had so peter really couldn t be blamed for not being able to believe that those old ones had been lost and in their pla

his patient acutely with his ears but you see how important it is said sir richmond and left his sentence unfinished i ll do what i can for you said the doctor and considered swiftly what line of talk he had best follow section this sense of a coming smash is epidemic said the doctor it s at the back of all sorts of mental trouble it is a new state of mind before the war it was abnormal a phase of neurasthenia now it is almost the normal state with whole classes of intelligent people intelligent i say the others always have been casual and adventurous and always will be a loss of confidence in the general background of life so that we seem to float over abysses we do said sir richmond and we have nothing but the old habits and ideas acquired in the days of our assurance there is a discord a jarring the doctor pursued his train of thought a new raw and dreadful sense of responsibility for the universe accompanied by a realization that the job is overwhelmingly too big for us we ve got to stand up to the job said sir richmond anyhow what else is there to do we may keep things together i ve got to do my bit and if only i could hold myself at it i could beat those fellows but that s where the devil of it comes in never have i been so desirous to work well in my life and never have i been so slack and weak willed and inaccurate sloppy indolent vicious the doctor was about to speak

unity i m not a man but a mob i ve got to recover my vigour at any cost again as the doctor was about to speak the word was taken out of his mouth and what i think of it dr martineau is this it s fatigue it s mental and moral fatigue too much effort on too high a level and too austere one strains and fags flags flags i meant to say one strains and flags and then the lower stuff in one the subconscious stuff takes control there was a flavour of popularized psychoanalysis about this and the doctor drew in the corners of his mouth and gave his head a critical slant m m but this only made sir richmond raise his voice and quicken his speech i want he said a good tonic a pick me up a stimulating harmless drug of some sort that s indicated anyhow to begin with something to pull me together as people say bring me up to the scratch again i don t like the use of drugs said the doctor the expectation of sir richmond s expression changed to disappointment but that s not reasonable he cried that s not reasonable that s superstition call a thing a drug and condemn it everything is a drug everything that affects you food stimulates or tranquillizes drink noise is a stimulant and quiet an opiate what is life but response to stimulants or reaction after them when i m exhausted i want food when i m overactive and sleepless i want tranquillizing when i m dispersed i want pulling together but we don t know how to use drugs the doctor objected but you ought to know dr martineau fixed his eye on a first floor window sill on the opposite side of harley street his manner suggested a lecturer holding on to his theme a day will come when we shall be able to manipulate drugs all sorts of drugs and work them in to our general way of living i have no prejudice against them at all a time will come when we shall correct our moods get down to our reserves of energy by their help suspend fatigue put off sleep during long spells of exertion at some sudden crisis for example when we shall know enough to know just how far to go with this that or the other stuff and how to wash out its after effects i quite agree with you in principle but that time hasn t come yet decades of research yet if we tried that sort of thing now we should be like children playing with poisons and explosives it s out of the question i ve been taking a few little things already easton syrup for example strychnine it carries you for a time and drops you by the way has it done you any good any nett good it has i can see broken your sleep the doctor turned round again to his patient and looked up into his troubled face given physiological trouble i don t mind resorting to a drug given structural injury i don t mind surgery but except for any little mischief your amateur drugging may have done you do not seem to me to be either sick or injured you ve no trouble either of structure or material you are worried ill in your mind and otherwise perfectly sound it s the current of your

alone it is evil we avoid classification we do not deny it but when a man is classified something is lost the majority of mankind live on paper currency they use terms which are merely good for so much reality they never see actual coinage i should go even further than that said eeldrop the majority not only have no language to express anything save generalized man they are for the most part unaware of themselves as anything but generalized men they are first of all government officials or pillars of the church or trade unionists or poets or unemployed this cataloguing is not only satisfactory to other people for practical purposes it is sufficient to themselves for their life of the spirit many are not quite real at any moment when wolstrip married i am sure he said to himself

from our point of view and not return upon itself to explain our point of view a philosophy about intuition is somewhat less likely to be intuitive than any other we must avoid having a platform but at least said appleplex we are individualists no nor anti intellectualists these also are labels the individualist is a member of a mob as fully as any other man and the mob of individualists is the most unpleasing because it has the least character nietzsche was a mob man just as bergson is an intellectualist we cannot escape the label but let it be one which carries no distinction and arouses

history have a queer fascination for me that perhaps has its roots in occurrences or dreams of which this is not the place to speak lastly now and again i read one of the latin or greek authors in a translation since i regret to say that my lack of education does not enable me to do so in the original but for modern fiction i have no taste although from time to time i sample it in a railway train and occasionally am amused by such excursions into the poetic and unreal so it came about that the more good bothered me to read this particular romance the more i determined that i would do nothing of the sort being a persistent person however when he went away about ten o clock at night he deposited it by my side under my nose indeed so that it might not be overlooked thus it came about that i could not help seeing some egyptian hieroglyphics in an oval on the cover also the title and underneath it your own name my friend all of which excited my curiosity especially the title which was brief and enigmatic consisting indeed of one word she i took up the work and on opening it the first thing my eye fell upon was a picture of a veiled woman the sight of which made my heart stand still so painfully did it remind me of a certain veiled woman whom once it had been my fortune to meet glancing from it to the printed page one word seemed to leap at me it was k r now of veiled women there are plenty in the world but were there also two k rs then i turned to the beginning and began to read this happened in the autumn when the sun does not rise till about six but it was broad daylight before i ceased from reading or rather rushing through that book oh what was i to make of it for here in its pages to say nothing of old billali who by the way lied probably to order when he told mr holly that no white man had visited his country for many generations and those gloomy man eating amahagger scoundrels once again i found myself face to face with she who commands now rendered as she who must be obeyed which means much the same thing in her case at least yes with ayesha the lovely the mystic the changeful and the imperious moreover the history filled up many gaps in my own limited experiences of that enigmatical being who was half divine though i think rather wicked or at any rate unmoral in her way and yet all woman it is true that it showed her in lights very different from and higher than those in which she had presented herself to me yet the substratum of her character was the same or rather of her characters for of these she seemed to have several in a single body being as she said of herself to me not one but many and not here but everywhere further i found the story of kallikrates which i had set down as a mere falsehood invented for my bewilderment expanded and explained or rather not explained since perhaps that she might deceive to me she had spoken of this murdered kallikrates without enthusiasm as a handsome person to whom because of an indiscretion of her youth she was bound by destiny and whose return somewhat to her sorrow she must wait at least she did so at first though in the end when she bared her heart at the moment of our farewell she vowed she loved him only and was appointed to him by a divine decree also i found other things of which i knew nothing such as the fire of life with its fatal gift of indefinite existence although i remember that like the giant rezu whom umslopogaas defeated she did talk of a cup of life of which she had drunk that might have been offered to my lips had i been politic bowed the knee and shown more faith in her and her supernatural pretensions lastly i saw the story of her end and as i read it i wept yes i confess i wept although i feel sure that she will return again now i understood why she had quailed and even seemed to shrivel when in my last interview with her stung beyond endurance by her witcheries and sarcasms i had suggested that even for her with all her powers fate might reserve one of its shrewdest blows some prescience had told her that if the words seemed random truth spoke through my lips although and this was the worst of it she did not know what weapon would deal the stroke or when and where it was doomed to fall i was amazed i was overcome but as i closed that book i made up my mind first that i would continue to preserve absolute silence as to ayesha and my dealings with her as during my life i was bound by oath to do and secondly that i would not cause my manuscript to be destroyed i did not feel that i had any right to do so in view of what already had been published to the world there let it lie to appear one day or not to appear as might be fated meanwhile my lips were sealed i would give good back his book without comment and buy another copy one more word it is clear that i did not touch more than the fringe of the real ayesha in a thousand ways she bewitched and deceived me so that i never plumbed her nature s depths perhaps this was my own fault because from the first i shewed a lack of faith in her and she wished to pay me back in her own fashion or perhaps she had other private reasons for her secrecy certainly the character she discovered to me differed in many ways from that which she revealed to mr holly and to leo vincey or kallikrates whom it seems once she slew in her jealousy and rage she told me as much

confess that they do not know what mind actually is or how matter is constituted but they remain convinced that there is an impassable gulf between the two and that both belong to what actually exists in the world philosophers on the other hand have maintained often that matter is a mere fiction imagined by mind and sometimes that mind is a mere property of a certain kind of matter those who maintain that mind is the reality and matter an evil dream are called idealists a word which has a different meaning in philosophy from that which it bears in ordinary life those who argue that matter is the reality and mind a mere property of protoplasm are called materialists they have been rare among philosophers but common at certain periods among men of science idealists materialists and ordinary mortals have been in agreement on one point that they knew sufficiently what they meant by the words mind and matter to be able to conduct their debate intelligently yet it was just in this point as to which they were at one that they seem to me to have been all alike in error the stuff of which the world of our experience is composed is in my belief neither mind nor matter but something more primitive than either both mind and matter seem to be composite and the stuff of which they are compounded lies in a sense between the two in a sense above them both like a common ancestor as regards matter i have set forth my reasons for this view on former occasions and i shall not now repeat them but the question of mind is more difficult and it is this question that i propose to discuss in these lectures a great deal of what i shall have to say is not original indeed much recent work in various fields has tended to show the necessity of such theories as those which i shall be advocating accordingly in this first lecture i shall try to give a brief description of the systems of ideas within which our investigation is to be carried on our knowledge of the external world allen unwin chapters iii and iv also mysticism and logic essays vii and viii if there is one thing that may be said in the popular estimation to characterize mind that one thing is consciousness we say that we are conscious of what we see and hear of what we remember and of our own thoughts and feelings most of us believe that tables and chairs are not conscious we think that when we sit in a chair we are aware of sitting in it but it is not aware of being sat in it cannot for a moment be doubted that we are right in believing that there is some difference between us and the chair in this respect so much may be taken as fact and as a datum for our inquiry but as soon as we try to say what exactly the difference is we become involved in perplexities is consciousness ultimate and simple something to be merely accepted and contemplated or is it something complex perhaps consisting in our way of behaving in the presence of objects or alternatively in the existence in us of things called ideas having a certain relation to objects though different from them and only symbolically representative of them such questions are not easy to answer but until they are answered we cannot profess to know what we mean by saying that we are possessed of consciousness before considering modern theories let us look first at consciousness from the standpoint of conventional psychology since this embodies views which naturally occur when we begin to reflect upon the subject for this purpose let us as a preliminary consider different ways of being conscious first there is the way of perception we perceive tables and chairs horses and dogs our friends traffic passing in the street in short anything which we recognize through the senses i leave on one side for the present the question whether pure sensation is to be regarded as a form of consciousness what i am speaking of now is perception where according to conventional psychology we go beyond the sensation to the thing which it represents when you hear a donkey bray you not only hear a noise but realize that it comes from a donkey when you see a table you not only see a coloured surface but realize that it is hard the addition of these elements that go beyond crude sensation is said to constitute perception we shall have more to say about this at a later stage for the moment i am merely

desolation which i shall never forget are for the most part unutterably bad of course we cried out that shakespeare wrote books and milton and shelley oh yes she interrupted us you ve been well taught i can see but you are not members of the london library here her sobs broke forth anew at length recovering a little she opened one of the pile of books which she always carried about with her from a window or in a garden or some such name as that it was called and it was written by a man called benton or henson or something of that kind she read the first few pages we listened in silence but that s not a book someone said so she chose another this time it was a history but i have forgotten the writer s name our trepidation increased as she went on not a word of it seemed to be true and the style in which it was written was execrable poetry poetry we cried impatiently read us poetry i cannot describe the desolation which fell upon us as she opened a little volume and mouthed out the verbose sentimental foolery which it contained it must have been written by a woman one of us urged but no she told us that it was written by a young man one of the most famous poets of the day i leave you to imagine what the shock of the discovery was though we all cried and begged her to read no more she persisted and read us extracts from the lives of the lord chancellors when she had finished jane the eldest and wisest of us rose to her feet and said that she for one was not convinced why she asked if men write such rubbish as this should our mothers have wasted their youth in bringing them into the world we were all silent and in the silence poor poll could be heard sobbing out why why did my father teach me to read clorinda was the first to come to her senses it s all our fault she said every one of us knows how to read but no one save poll has ever taken the trouble to do it i for one have taken it for granted that it was a woman s duty to spend her youth in bearing children i venerated my mother for bearing ten still more my grandmother for bearing fifteen it was i confess my own ambition to bear twenty we have gone on all these ages supposing that men were equally industrious and that their works were of equal merit while we have borne the children they we supposed have borne the books and the pictures we have populated the world they have civilized it but now that we can read what prevents us from judging the results before we bring another child into the world we must swear that we will find out what the world is like so we made ourselves into a society for asking questions one of us was to visit a man of war another was to hide herself in a scholar s study another was to attend a meeting of business men while all were to read books look at pictures go to concerts keep our eyes open in the streets and ask questions perpetually we were very young you can judge of our simplicity when i tell you that before parting that night we agreed that the objects of life were to produce good people and good books our questions were to be directed to finding out how far these objects were now attained by men we vowed solemnly that we would not bear a single child until we were satisfied off we went then some to the british museum others to the king s navy some to oxford others to cambridge we visited the royal academy and the tate heard modern music in concert rooms went to the law courts and saw new plays no one dined out without asking her partner certain questions and carefully noting his replies at intervals we met together and compared our observations oh those were merry meetings never have i laughed so much as i did when rose read her notes upon honour and described how she had dressed herself as an x thiopian prince and gone aboard one of his majesty s ships discovering the hoax the captain visited her now disguised as a private gentleman and demanded that honour should be satisfied but how she asked how he bellowed with the cane of course seeing that he was beside himself with rage and expecting that her last moment had come she bent over and received to her amazement six light taps upon the behind the honour of the british navy is avenged he cried and raising herself she saw him with the sweat pouring down his face holding out a trembling right hand away she exclaimed striking an attitude and imitating the ferocity of his own expression my honour has still to be satisfied spoken like a gentleman he returned and fell into profound thought if six strokes avenge the honour of the king s navy he mused how many avenge the honour of a private gentleman he said he would prefer to lay the case before his brother officers she replied haughtily that she could not wait he praised her sensibility let me see he cried suddenly did your father keep a carriage no she said or a riding horse we had a donkey she bethought her which drew the mowing machine at this his face lighted my mother s name she added for god s sake man don t mention your mother s name he shrieked trembling like an aspen and flushing to the roots of his hair and it was ten minutes at least before she could induce him to proceed at length he decreed that if she gave him four strokes and a half in the small of the back at a spot indicated by himself the half conceded he said in recognition of the fact that her great grandmother s uncle was killed at trafalgar it was his opinion that her honour would be as good as new this was done they retired to a restaurant drank two bottles of wine for which he insisted upon paying and parted with protestations of eternal friendship then we had fanny s account of her visi

that he had not improved in the slightest degree since their last meeting and sam who imagined that he had long since grown to man s estate and put off childish things was embarrassed to discover that his aunt still affected him as of old that is to say she made him feel as if he had omitted to shave and in addition to that had swallowed some drug which had caused him to swell unpleasantly particularly about the hands and feet jolly morning said sam perseveringly so i imagine i have not yet been out thought i d look in and see how you were that was very kind of you the morning is my busy time but yes that was very kind of you there was another pause how do you like america said sam i dislike it exceedingly yes well of course some people do prohibition and all that personally it doesn t affect me i can take it or leave it alone the reason i dislike america began mrs hignett bridling i like it myself said sam i ve had a wonderful time everybody s treated me like a rich uncle i ve been in detroit you know and they practically gave me the city and asked me if i d like another to take home in my pocket never saw anything like it i might have been the missing heir i think america s the greatest invention on record and what brought you to america said mrs hignett unmoved by this rhapsody oh i came over to play golf in a tournament you know surely at your age said mrs hignett disapprovingly you could be better occupied do you spend your whole time playing golf oh no i hunt a bit and shoot a bit and i swim a good lot and i still play football occasionally i wonder your father does not insist on your doing some useful work he is beginning to harp on the subject rather i suppose i shall take a stab at it sooner or later father says i ought to get married too he is perfectly right i suppose old eustace will be getting hitched up one of these days said sam mrs hignett started violently why do you say that eh what makes you say that oh well he s a romantic sort of fellow writes poetry and all that there is no likelihood at all of eustace marrying he is of a shy and retiring temperament and sees few women he is almost a recluse sam was aware of this and had frequently regretted it he had always been fond of his cousin and in that half amused and rather patronising way in which men of thews and sinews are fond of the weaker brethren who run more to pallor and intellect and he had always felt that if eustace had not had to retire to windles to spend his life with a woman whom from his earliest years he had always considered the empress of the wash outs much might have been made of him both at school and at oxford eustace had been if not a sport at least a decidedly cheery old bean sam remembered eustace at school breaking gas globes with a slipper in a positively rollicking manner he remembered him at oxford playing up to him manfully at the piano on the occasion when he had done that imitation of frank tinney which had been such a hit at the trinity smoker yes eustace had had the makings of a pretty sound egg and it was too bad that he had allowed his mother to coop him up down in the country miles away from anywhere eustace is returning to england on saturday said mrs hignett she spoke a little wistfully she had not been parted from her son since he had come down from oxford and she would have liked to keep him with her till the end of her lecturing tour that however was out of the question it was imperative that while she was away he should be at windles nothing would have induced her to leave the place at the mercy of servants who might trample over the flower beds scratch the polished floors and forget to cover up the canary at night he sails on the atlantic that s splendid said sam i m sailing on the atlantic myself i ll go down to the office and see if we can t have a state room together but where is he going to live when he gets to england where is he going to live why at windles of course where else but i thought you were letting windles for the summer mrs hignett stared letting windles she spoke as one might address a lunatic what put that extraordinary idea into your head i thought father said something about your letting the place to some american nothing of the kind it seemed to sam that his aunt spoke somewhat vehemently even snappishly in correcting what was a perfectly natural mistake he could not know that the subject of letting windles for the summer was one which had long since begun to infuriate mrs hignett people had certainly asked her to let windles in fact people had pestered her there was a rich fat man an american named bennett whom she had met just before sailing at her brother s house in london invited down to windles for the day mr bennett had fallen in love with the place and had begged her to name her own price not content with this he had pursued her with his pleadings by means of the wireless telegraph while she was on the ocean and had not given up the struggle even when she reached new york he had egged on a friend of his a mr mortimer to continue the persecution in that city and this very morning among the letters on mrs hignett s table the buff envelope of a cable from mr bennett had peeped out nearly spoiling her breakfast no wonder then that sam s allusion to the affair had caused the authoress of the spreading light momentarily to lose her customary calm nothing will induce me ever to let windles she said with finality and rose significantly sam perceiving that the audience was at an end and glad of it also got up well i think i ll

history have a queer fascination for me that perhaps has its roots in occurrences or dreams of which this is not the place to speak lastly now and again i read one of the latin or greek authors in a translation since i regret to say that my lack of education does not enable me to do so in the original but for modern fiction i have no taste although from time to time i sample it in a railway train and occasionally am amused by such excursions into the poetic and unreal so it came about that the more good bothered me to read this particular romance the more i determined that i would do nothing of the sort being a persistent person however when he went away about ten o clock at night he deposited it by my side under my nose indeed so that it might not be overlooked thus it came about that i could not help seeing some egyptian hieroglyphics in an oval on the cover also the title and underneath it your own name my friend all of which excited my curiosity especially the title which was brief and enigmatic consisting indeed of one word she i took up the work and on opening it the first thing my eye fell upon was a picture of a veiled woman the sight of which made my heart stand still so painfully did it remind me of a certain veiled woman whom once it had been my fortune to meet glancing from it to the printed page one word seemed to leap at me it was k r now of veiled women there are plenty in the world but were there also two k rs then i turned to the beginning and began to read this happened in the autumn when the sun does not rise till about six but it was broad daylight before i ceased from reading or rather rushing through that book oh what was i to make of it for here in its pages to say nothing of old billali who by the way lied probably to order when he told mr holly that no white man had visited his country for many generations and those gloomy man eating amahagger scoundrels once again i found myself face to face with she who commands now rendered as she who must be obeyed which means much the same thing in her case at least yes with ayesha the lovely the mystic the changeful and the imperious moreover the history filled up many gaps in my own limited experiences of that enigmatical being who was half divine though i think rather wicked or at any rate unmoral in her way and yet all woman it is true that it showed her in lights very different from and higher than those in which she had presented herself to me yet the substratum of her character was the same or rather of her characters for of these she seemed to have several in a single body being as she said of herself to me not one but many and not here but everywhere further i found the story of kallikrates which i had set down as a mere falsehood invented for my bewilderment expanded and explained or rather not explained since perhaps that she might deceive to me she had spoken of this murdered kallikrates without enthusiasm as a handsome person to whom because of an indiscretion of her youth she was bound by destiny and whose return somewhat to her sorrow she must wait at least she did so at first though in the end when she bared her heart at the moment of our farewell she vowed she loved him only and was appointed to him by a divine decree also i found other things of which i knew nothing such as the fire of life with its fatal gift of indefinite existence although i remember that like the giant rezu whom umslopogaas defeated she did talk of a cup of life of which she had drunk that might have been offered to my lips had i been politic bowed the knee and shown more faith in her and her supernatural pretensions lastly i saw the story of her end and as i read it i wept yes i confess i wept although i feel sure that she will return again now i understood why she had quailed and even seemed to shrivel when in my last interview with her stung beyond endurance by her witcheries and sarcasms i had suggested that even for her with all her powers fate might reserve one of its shrewdest blows some prescience had told her that if the words seemed random truth spoke through my lips although and this was the worst of it she did not know what weapon would deal the stroke or when and where it was doomed to fall i was amazed i was overcome but as i closed that book i made up my mind first that i would continue to preserve absolute silence as to ayesha and my dealings with her as during my life i was bound by oath to do and secondly that i would not cause my manuscript to be destroyed i did not feel that i had any right to do so in view of what already had been published to the world there let it lie to appear one day or not to appear as might be fated meanwhile my lips were sealed i would give good back his book without comment and buy another copy one more word it is clear that i did not touch more than the fringe of the real ayesha in a thousand ways she bewitched and deceived me so that i never plumbed her nature s depths perhaps this was my own fault because from the first i shewed a lack of faith in her and she wished to pay me back in her own fashion or perhaps she had other private reasons for her secrecy certainly the character she discovered to me differed in many ways from that which she revealed to mr holly and to leo vincey or kallikrates whom it seems once she slew in her jealousy and rage she told me as much as she thought it fit that i should know and no more allan quatermain the grange yorkshire she and allan chapter i the talisman i believe it was the old egyptians a very wise people probably indeed

too having received a good many knocks at home he kept the hard head out of sight and played at poetry and romance with his literary wife and his sturdy passionate girls he was a man of courage not given to complaining bearing his burdens by himself no he did not let the world intrude far into his home he had a delicate sensitive wife whose poetry won some fame in the narrow world of letters he himself with his tough old barbarian fighting spirit had an almost child like delight in verse in sweet poetry and in the delightful game of a cultured home his blood was strong even to coarseness but that only made the home more vigorous more robust and christmassy there was always a touch of christmas about him now he was well off if there was poetry after dinner there were also chocolates and nuts and good little out of the way things to be munching well then into this family came egbert he was made of quite a different paste the girls and the father were strong limbed thick blooded people true english as holly trees and hawthorn are english their culture was grafted on to them as one might perhaps graft a common pink rose on to a thornstem it flowered oddly enough but it did not alter their blood and egbert was a born rose the age long breeding had left him with a delightful spontaneous passion he was not clever nor even literary no but the intonation of his voice and the movement of his supple handsome body and the fine texture of his flesh and his hair the slight arch of his nose the quickness of his blue eyes would easily take the place of poetry winifred loved him loved him this southerner as a higher being a higher being mind you not a deeper and as for him he loved her in passion with every fibre of him she was the very warm stuff of life to him wonderful then those days at crockham cottage the first days all alone save for the woman who came to work in the mornings marvellous days when she had all his tall supple fine fleshed youth to herself for herself and he had her like a ruddy fire into which he could cast himself for rejuvenation ah that it might never end this passion this marriage the flame of their two bodies burnt again into that old cottage that was haunted already by so much by gone physical desire you could not be in the dark room for an hour without the influences coming over you the hot blood desire of by gone yeomen there in this old den where they had lusted and bred for so many generations the silent house dark with thick timbered walls and the big black chimney place and the sense of secrecy dark with low little windows sunk into the earth dark like a lair where strong beasts had lurked and mated lonely at night and lonely by day left to themselves and their own intensity for so many generations it seemed to cast a spell on the two young people they became different there was a curious secret glow about them a certain slumbering flame hard to understand that enveloped them both they too felt that they did not belong to the london world any more crockham had changed their blood the sense of the snakes that lived and slept even in their own garden in the sun so that he going forward with the spade would see a curious coiled brownish pile on the black soil which suddenly would start up hiss and dazzle rapidly away hissing one day winifred heard the strangest scream from the flower bed under the low window of the living room ah the strangest scream like the very soul of the dark past crying aloud she ran out and saw a long brown snake on the flower bed and in its flat mouth the one hind leg of a frog was striving to escape and screaming its strange tiny bellowing scream she looked at the snake and from its sullen flat head it looked at her obstinately she gave a cry and it released the frog and slid angrily away that was crockham the spear of modern invention had not passed through it and it lay there secret primitive savage as when the saxons first came and egbert and she were caught there caught out of the world he was not idle nor was she there were plenty of things to be done the house to be put into final repair after the workmen had gone cushions and curtains to sew the paths to make the water to fetch and attend to and then the slope of the deep soiled neglected garden to level to terrace with little terraces and paths and to fill with flowers he worked away in his shirt sleeves worked all day intermittently doing this thing and the other and she quiet and rich in herself seeing him stooping and labouring away by himself would come to help him to be near him he of course was an amateur a born amateur he worked so hard and did so little and nothing he ever did would hold together for long if he terraced the garden he held up the earth with a couple of long narrow planks that soon began to bend with the pressure from behind and would not need many years to rot through and break and let the soil slither all down again in a heap towards the stream bed but there you are he had not been brought up to come to grips with anything and he thought it would do nay he did not think there was anything else except little temporary contrivances possible he who had such a passion for his old enduring cottage and for the old enduring things of the bygone england curious that the sense of permanency in the past had such a hold over him whilst in the present he was all amateurish and sketchy winifred could not criticize him town bred everything seemed to her splendid and the very digging and shovelling itself seemed romantic but neither egbert nor she yet

reached an unalterable decision never again to meddle with the mighty awe inspiring secrets of creation but with returning health and balance he found himself viewing his recent triumph with feelings of renewed hope and anticipation the morbid fears superinduced by the shock following the sudden demise of the first creature of his experiments had given place to a growing desire to further prosecute his labors until enduring success had crowned his efforts with an achievement which he might exhibit with pride to the scientific world his recent disastrous success had convinced him that neither ithaca nor any other abode of civilization was a safe place to continue his experiments but it was not until their cruising had brought them among the multitudinous islands of the east indies that the plan occurred to him that he finally adopted a plan the outcome of which could he then have foreseen would have sent him scurrying to the safety of his own country with the daughter who was to bear the full brunt of the horrors it entailed they were steaming up the china sea when the idea first suggested itself and as he sat idly during the long hot days the thought grew upon him expanding into a thousand wonderful possibilities until it became crystalized into what was a little short of an obsession the result was that at manila much to virginia s surprise he announced the abandonment of the balance of their purposed voyage taking immediate return passage to singapore his daughter did not question him as to the cause of this change in plans for since those three days that her father had kept himself locked in his workroom at home the girl had noticed a subtle change in her parent a marked disinclination to share with her his every confidence as had been his custom since the death of her mother while it grieved her immeasurably she was both too proud and too hurt to sue for a reestablishment of the old relations on all other topics than his scientific work their interests were as mutual as formerly but by what seemed a manner of tacit agreement this subject was taboo and so it was that they came to singapore without the girl having the slightest conception of her father s plans here they spent nearly a month during which time professor maxon was daily engaged in interviewing officials english residents and a motley horde of malays and chinamen virginia met socially several of the men with whom her father was engaged but it was only at the last moment that one of them let drop a hint of the purpose of the month s activity when virginia was present the conversation seemed always deftly guided from the subject of her father s immediate future and she was not long in discerning that it was in no sense through accident that this was true thereafter her wounded pride made easy the task of those who seemed combined to keep her in ignorance it was a dr von horn who had been oftenest with her father who gave her the first intimation of what was forthcoming afterward in recollecting the conversation it seemed to virginia that the young man had been directed to break the news to her that her father might be spared the ordeal it was evident then that he expected opposition but the girl was too loyal to let von horn know if she felt other than in harmony with the proposal and too proud to evince by surprise the fact that she was not wholly conversant with its every detail you are glad to be leaving singapore so soon he had asked although he knew that she had not been advised that an early departure was planned i am rather looking forward to it replied virginia and to a protracted residence on one of the pamarung islands continued von horn why not was her rather non committal reply though she had not the remotest idea of their location von horn admired her nerve though he rather wished that she would ask some questions it was difficult making progress in this way how could he explain the plans when she evinced not the slightest sign that she was not already entirely conversant with them we doubt if the work will be completed under two or three years answered the doctor that will be a long time in which to be isolated upon a savage little speck of land off the larger but no less savage borneo do you think that your bravery is equal to the demands that will be made upon it virginia laughed nor was there the slightest tremor in its note i am equal to whatever fate my father is equal to she said nor do i think that a life upon one of these beautiful little islands would be much of a hardship certainly not if it will help to promote the success of his scientific experiments she used the last words on a chance that she might have hit upon the true reason for the contemplated isolation from

myths now begin to hypnotize us again our own impulse towards our own scientific way of understanding being almost spent and so besides myths we find the same mathematic figures cosmic graphs which remain among the aboriginal peoples in all continents mystic figures and signs whose true cosmic or scientific significance is lost yet which continue in use for purposes of conjuring or divining if my reader finds this bosh and abracadabra all right for him only i have no more regard for his little crowings on his own little dunghill myself i am not so sure that i am one of the one and onlies i

human splendor unfolding through the earth s changing periods floods and fire and convulsions and ice arrest intervene between the great glamorous civilizations of mankind but nothing will ever quench humanity and the human potentiality to evolve something magnificent out of a renewed chaos i do not believe in evolution but in the strangeness and rainbow change of ever renewed creative civilizations so much then for my claim to remarkable discoveries i believe i am only trying to stammer out the first terms of a forgotten knowledge but i have no desire to revive dead kings or dead sages it is not for me to arrange fossils and decipher hieroglyphic phrases i couldn t do it if i wanted to but then i can do something else the soul must take the hint from the relics our scientists have so marvelously gathered out of the forgotten past and from the hint develop a new living utterance the spark is from dead wisdom but the fire is life and as an example a very simple one of how a scientist of the most innocent modern sort may hint at truths which when stated he would laugh at as fantastic nonsense let us quote a word from the already old fashioned golden bough it must have appeared to the ancient aryan that the sun was periodically recruited from the fire which resided in the sacred oak exactly the fire which resided in the tree of life that is life itself so we must read it must have appeared to the ancient aryan that the sun was periodically recruited from life which is what the early greek philosophers were always saying and which still seems to me the real truth the clue to the cosmos instead of life being drawn from the sun it is the emanation from life itself that is from all the living plants and creatures which nourish the sun of course my dear critic the ancient aryans were just doddering the old duffers or babbling the babes but as for me i have some respect for my ancestors and believe they had more up their sleeve than just the marvel of the unborn me one last weary little word this pseudo philosophy of mine pollyanalytics as one of my respected critics might say is deduced from the novels and poems not the reverse the novels and poems come unwatched out of one s pen and then the absolute need which one has for some sort of satisfactory mental attitude towards oneself and things in general makes one try to abstract some definite conclusions from one s experiences as a writer and as a man the novels and poems are pure passionate experience these pollyanalytics are inferences made afterwards from the experience and finally it seems to me that even art is utterly dependent on philosophy or if you prefer it on a metaphysic the metaphysic or philosophy may not be anywhere very accurately stated and may be quite unconscious in the artist yet it is a metaphysic that governs men at the time and is by all men more or less comprehended and lived men live and see according to some gradually developing and gradually withering vision this vision exists also as a dynamic idea or metaphysic exists first as such then it is unfolded into life and art our vision our belief our metaphysic is wearing woefully thin and the art is wearing absolutely threadbare we have no future neither for our hopes nor our aims nor our art it has all gone gray and opaque we ve got to rip the old veil of a vision across and find what the heart really believes in after all and what the heart really wants for the next future and we ve got to put it down in terms of belief and of knowledge and then go forward again to the fulfillment in life and art rip the veil of the old vision across and walk through the rent and if i try to do this well why not if i try to write down what i see why not if a publisher likes to print the book all right and if anybody wants to read it let him but why anybody should read one single word if he doesn t want to i don t see unless of course he is a critic who needs to scribble a dollar

psychoanalysis as if freud had invented and described nothing but an unconscious in all his theory the unconscious is not of course the clue to the freudian theory the real clue is sex a sexual motive is to be attributed to all human activity now this is going too far we are bound to admit than an element of sex enters into all human activity but so does an element of greed and of many other things

history have a queer fascination for me that perhaps has its roots in occurrences or dreams of which this is not the place to speak lastly now and again i read one of the latin or greek authors in a translation since i regret to say that my lack of education does not enable me to do so in the original but for modern fiction i have no taste although from time to time i sample it in a railway train and occasionally am amused by such excursions into the poetic and unreal so it came about that the more good bothered me to read this particular romance the more i determined that i would do nothing of the sort being a persistent person however when he went away about ten o clock at night he deposited it by my side under my nose indeed so that it might not be overlooked thus it came about that i could not help seeing some egyptian hieroglyphics in an oval on the cover also the title and underneath it your own name my friend all of which excited my curiosity especially the title which was brief and enigmatic consisting indeed of one word she i took up the work and on opening it the first thing my eye fell upon was a picture of a veiled woman the sight of which made my heart stand still so painfully did it remind me of a certain veiled woman whom once it had been my fortune to meet glancing from it to the printed page one word seemed to leap at me it was k r now of veiled women there are plenty in the world but were there also two k rs then i turned to the beginning and began to read this happened in the autumn when the sun does not rise till about six but it was broad daylight before i ceased from reading or rather rushing through that book oh what was i to make of it for here in its pages to say nothing of old billali who by the way lied probably to order when he told mr holly that no white man had visited his country for many generations and those gloomy man eating amahagger scoundrels once again i found myself face to face with she who commands now rendered as she who must be obeyed which means much the same thing in her case at least yes with ayesha the lovely the mystic the changeful and the imperious moreover the history filled up many gaps in my own limited experiences of that enigmatical being who was half divine though i think rather wicked or at any rate unmoral in her way and yet all woman it is true that it showed her in lights very different from and higher than those in which she had presented herself to me yet the substratum of her character was the same or rather of her characters for of these she seemed to have several in a single body being as she said of herself to me not one but many and not here but everywhere further i found the story of kallikrates which i had set down as a mere falsehood invented for my bewilderment expanded and explained or rather not explained since perhaps that she might deceive to me she had spoken of this murdered kallikrates without enthusiasm as a handsome person to whom because of an indiscretion of her youth she was bound by destiny and whose return somewhat to her sorrow she must wait at least she did so at first though in the end when she bared her heart at the moment of our farewell she vowed she loved him only and was appointed to him by a divine decree also i found other things of which i knew nothing such as the fire of life with its fatal gift of indefinite existence although i remember that like the giant rezu whom umslopogaas defeated she did talk of a cup of life of which she had drunk that might have been offered to my lips had i been politic bowed the knee and shown more faith in her and her supernatural pretensions lastly i saw the story of her end and as i read it i wept yes i confess i wept although i feel sure that she will return again now i understood why she had quailed and even seemed to shrivel when in my last interview with her stung beyond endurance by her witcheries and sarcasms i had suggested that even for her with all her powers fate might reserve one of its shrewdest blows some prescience had told her that if the words seemed random truth spoke through my lips although and this was the worst of it she did not know what weapon would deal the stroke or when and where it was doomed to fall i was amazed i was overcome but as i closed that book i made up my mind first that i would continue to preserve absolute silence as to ayesha and my dealings with her as during my life i was bound by oath to do and secondly that i would not cause my manuscript to be destroyed i did not feel that i had any right to do so in view of what already had been published to the world there let it lie to appear one day or not to appear as might be fated meanwhile my lips were sealed i would give good back his book without comment and buy another copy one more word it is clear that i did not touch more than the fringe of the real ayesha in a thousand ways she bewitched and deceived me so that i never plumbed her nature s depths perhaps this was my own fault because from the first i shewed a lack of faith in her and she wished to pay me back in her own fashion or perhaps she had other private reasons for her secrecy certainly the character she discovered to me differed in many ways from that which she revealed to mr holly and to leo vincey or kallikrates whom it seems once she slew in her jealousy and rage she told me as much as she thought it fit that i should know and no more allan quatermain the grange yorkshire she and allan chapter i the talisman i believe it was the old egyptians a very wise people probably indeed

resemblance to an owl perched upon the edge of its nest hole he was busily engaged in doing nothing and in staring into nothingness as according to tom was his habit when communing with what he tom called his dratted speerits customer said tom in a harsh voice sorry to disturb you at your prayers guv nor but not having two pair of hands i can t serve a crowd meaning the old woman of the undergarments and myself mr potts slid off his stool and prepared for action when he saw however who the customer was he bristled that is the only word for it the truth is that although between us there was an inward and spiritual sympathy there was also an outward and visible hostility twice i had outbid mr potts at a local auction for articles which he desired moreover after the fashion of every good collector he felt it to be his duty to hate me as another collector lastly several times i had offered him smaller sums for antiques upon which he set a certain monetary value it is true that long ago i had given up this bargaining for the reason that mr potts would never take less than he asked indeed he followed the example of the vendor of the sibylline books in ancient rome he did not destroy the goods indeed after the fashion of that person and demand the price of all of them for the one that remained but invariably he put up his figure by per cent and nothing would induce him to take off one farthing what do you want sir he said grumpily vests hose collars or socks oh socks i think i replied at hazard thinking that they would be easiest to carry whereupon mr potts produced some peculiarly objectionable and shapeless woollen articles which he almost threw at me saying that they were all he had in stock now i detest woollen socks and never wear them still i made a purchase thinking with sympathy of my old gardener whose feet they would soon be scratching and while the parcel was being tied up said in an insinuating voice anything fresh upstairs mr potts no sir he answered shortly at least not much and if there were what s the use of showing them to you after the business about that clock it was you wanted for it mr potts i asked no sir it was and now it s per cent on to that you can work out the sum for yourself well let s have another look at it mr potts i replied humbly whereon with a grunt and a muttered injunction to tom to mind the shop he led the way upstairs now the house in which mr potts dwelt had once been of considerable pretensions and was very very old elizabethan i should think although it had been refronted with a horrible stucco to suit modern tastes the oak staircase was good though narrow and led to numerous small rooms upon two floors above some of which rooms were panelled and had oak beams now whitewashed like the panelling at least they had once been whitewashed probably in the last generation these rooms were literally crammed with every sort of old furniture most of it decrepit though for many of the articles dealers would have given a good price but at dealers mr potts drew the line not one of them had ever set a foot upon that oaken stair to the attics the place was filled with this furniture and other articles such as books china samplers with the glass broken and i know not what besides piled in heaps upon the floor indeed where mr potts slept was a mystery either it must have been under the counter in his shop or perhaps at nights he inhabited a worm eaten jacobean bedstead which stood in an attic for i observed a kind of pathway to it running through a number of legless chairs also some dirty blankets between the moth riddled curtains not far from this bedstead propped in an intoxicated way against the sloping wall of the old house stood the clock which i desired it was one of the first regulator clocks with a wooden pendulum used by the maker himself to check the time keeping of all his other clocks and enclosed in a chaste and perfect mahogany case of the very best style of its period so beautiful was it indeed that it had been an instance of love at first sight between us and although there was an estrangement on the matter of settlements or in other words over the question of price now i felt that never more could that clock and i be parted so i agreed to give old potts the or to be accurate s which he asked on the per cent rise principle thankful in my heart that he had not made it more and prepared to go as i turned however my eye fell upon a large chest of the almost indestructible yellow cypress wood of which were made it is said the doors of st peter s at rome that stood for eight hundred years and for aught i know are still standing as good as on the day when they were put up marriage coffer said potts answering my unspoken question italian about i suggested may be so or perhaps dutch made by italian artists but older than that for somebody has burnt on the lid with a hot iron not for sale not for sale at all much too good to sell just you look inside it the old key is tied to the spring lock never saw such poker work in my life gods and goddesses and i don t know what and venus sitting in the middle in a wreath of flowers with nothing on and holding

emotions and will xv characteristics of mental phenomena the analysis of mind lecture i recent criticisms of consciousness there are certain occurrences which we are in the habit of calling mental among these we may take as typical believing and desiring the exact definition of the word mental will i hope emerge as the lectures proceed for the present i shall mean by it whatever occurrences would commonly be called mental i wish in these lectures to analyse as fully as i can what it is that really takes place when we e g believe or desire in this first lecture i shall be concerned to refute a theory which is widely held and which i formerly held myself the theory that the essence of everything mental is a certain quite peculiar something called consciousness conceived either as a relation to objects or as a pervading quality of psychical phenomena the reasons which i shall give against this theory will be mainly derived from previous authors there are two sorts of reasons which will divide my lecture into two parts direct reasons derived from analysis and its difficulties indirect reasons derived from observation of animals comparative psychology and of the insane and hysterical psycho analysis few things are more firmly established in popular philosophy than the distinction between mind and matter those who are not professional metaphysicians are willing to confess that they do not know what mind actually is or how matter is constituted but they remain convinced that there is an impassable gulf between the two and that both belong to what actually exists in the world philosophers on the other hand have maintained often that matter is a mere fiction imagined by mind and sometimes that mind is a mere property of a certain kind of matter those who maintain that mind is the reality and matter an evil dream are called idealists a word which has a different meaning in philosophy from that which it bears in ordinary life those who argue that matter is the reality and mind a mere property of protoplasm are called materialists they have been rare among philosophers but common at certain periods among men of science idealists materialists and ordinary mortals have been in agreement on one point that they knew sufficiently what they meant by the words mind and matter to be able to conduct their debate intelligently yet it was just in this point as to which they were at one that they seem to me to have been all alike in error the stuff of which the world of our experience is composed is in my belief neither mind nor matter but something more primitive than either both mind and matter seem to be composite and the stuff of which they are compounded lies in a sense between the two in a sense above them both like a common ancestor as regards matter i have set forth my reasons for this view on former occasions and i shall not now repeat them but the question of mind is more difficult and it is this question that i propose to discuss in these lectures a great deal of what i shall have to say is not original indeed much recent work in various fields has tended to show the necessity of such theories as those which i shall be advocating accordingly in this first lecture i shall try to give a brief description of the systems of ideas within which our investigation is to be carried on our knowledge of the external world allen unwin chapters iii and iv also mysticism and logic essays vii and viii if there is one thing that may be said in the popular estimation to characterize mind that one thing is consciousness we say that we are conscious of what we see and hear of what we remember and of our own thoughts and feelings most of us believe that tables and chairs are not conscious we think that when we sit in a chair we are aware of sitting in it but it is not aware of being sat in it cannot for a moment be doubted that we are right in believing that there is some difference between us and the chair in this respect so much may be taken as fact and as a datum for our inquiry but as soon as we try to say what exactly the difference is we become involved in perplexities is consciousness ultimate and simple something to be merely accepted and contemplated or is it something complex perhaps consisting in our way of behaving in the presence of objects or alternatively in the existence in us of things called ideas having a certain relation to objects though different from them and only symbolically representative of them such questions are not easy to answer but until they are answered we cannot profess to know what we mean by saying that we are possessed of consciousness before considering modern theories let us look first at consciousness from the standpoint of conventional psychology since this embodies views which naturally occur when we begin to reflect upon the subject for this purpose let us as a preliminary consider different ways of being conscious first there is the way of perception we perceive tables and chairs horses and dogs our friends traffic passing in the street in short anything which we recognize through the senses i leave on one side for the present the question whether pure sensation is to be regarded as a form of consciousness what i am speaking of now is perception where according to conventional psychology we go beyond the sensation to the thing which it represents when you hear a donkey bray you not only hear a noise but realize that it comes from a donkey when you see a table you not only see a coloured surface but realize that it is hard the addition of these elements that go beyond crude sensation is said to constitute perception we shall have more to say about this at a later stage for the moment i am merely

far south as vinovia the governor shrugged his shoulders these things concern us no longer said he then a bitter smile broke upon his aquiline clean shaven face whom think you that i see in audience this morning nay i know not caradoc and regnus and celticus the icenian who like so many of the richer britons have been educated at rome and who would lay before me their plans as to the ruling of this country and what is their plan that they themselves should do it the roman soldier laughed well they will have their will said he as he saluted and turned upon his heel farewell your excellency there are hard days coming for you and for me an hour later the british deputation was ushered into the presence of the governor they were good steadfast men men who with a whole heart and at some risk to themselves had taken up their country s cause so far as they could see it at the same time they well knew that under the mild and beneficent rule of rome it was only when they passed from words to deeds that their backs or their necks would be in danger they stood now earnest and a little abashed before the throne of the viceroy celticus was a swarthy black bearded little iberian caradoc and regnus were tall middle aged men of the fair flaxen british type all three were dressed in the draped yellow toga after the latin fashion instead of in the brac and tunic which distinguished their more insular fellow countrymen well asked the governor we are here said celticus boldly as the spokesmen of a great number of our fellow countrymen for the purpose of sending our petition through you to the emperor and to the roman senate that we may urge upon them the policy of allowing us to govern this country after our own ancient fashion he paused as if awaiting some outburst as an answer to his own temerity but the governor merely nodded his head as a sign that he should proceed we had laws of our own before ever c sar set foot in britain which have served their purpose since first our forefathers came from the land of ham we are not a child among the nations but our history goes back in our own traditions further even than that of rome and we are galled by this yoke which you have laid upon us are not our laws just asked the governor the code of c sar is just but it is always the code of c sar our own laws were made for our own uses and our own circumstances and we would fain have them again you speak roman as if you had been bred in the forum you wear a roman toga your hair is filleted in roman fashion are not these the gifts of rome we would take all the learning and all the arts that rome or greece could give but we would still be britain and ruled by britons the viceroy smiled by the rood of saint helena said he had you spoken thus to some of my heathen ancestors there would have been an end to your politics that you have dared to stand before my face and say as much is a proof for ever of the gentleness of our rule but i would reason with you for a moment upon this your request you know well that this land has never been one kingdom but was always under many chiefs and many tribes who have made war upon each other would you in very truth have it so again those were in the evil pagan days the days of the druid and the oak grove your excellency but now we are held together by a gospel of peace the viceroy shook his head if all the world were of the same way of thinking then it would be easier said he it may be that this blessed doctrine of peace will be little help to you when you are face to face with strong men who still worship the god of war what would you do against the picts of the north your excellency knows that many of the bravest legionaries are of british blood these are our defence but discipline man the power to command the knowledge of war the strength to act it is in these things that you would fail too long have you leaned upon the crutch the times may be hard but when we have gone through them britain will be herself again nay she will be under a different and a harsher master said the roman already the pirates swarm upon the eastern coast were it not for our roman count of the saxon shore they would land to morrow i see the day when britain may indeed be one but that will be because you and your fellows are either dead or are driven into the mountains of the west all goes into the melting pot and if a better albion should come forth from it it will be after ages of strife and neither you nor your people will have part or lot in it regnus the tall young celt smiled with the help of god and our own right arms we should hope for a better end said he give us but the chance and we will bear the brunt you are as men that are lost said the viceroy sadly i see this

settled order will leave no trace behind for learn that it will indeed be as you wish and that this very day the orders have come to me that the legions are to go the three britons looked at each

sense enough to see that ideas exist and eugenics itself in large quantities or small coming quickly or coming slowly urged from good motives or bad applied to a thousand people or applied to three eugenics itself is a thing no more to be bargained about than poisoning it is not really difficult to sum up the essence of eugenics though some of the eugenists seem to be rather vague about it the movement consists of two parts a moral basis which is common to all and a scheme of social application which varies a good deal for the moral basis it is obvious that man s ethical responsibility varies with his knowledge of consequences if i were in charge of a baby like dr johnson in that tower of vision and if the baby was ill through having eaten the soap i might possibly send for a doctor i might be calling him away from much more serious cases from the bedsides of babies whose diet had been far more deadly but i should be justified i could not be expected to know enough about his other patients to be obliged or even entitled to sacrifice to them the baby for whom i was primarily and directly responsible now the eugenic moral basis is this that the baby for whom we are primarily and directly responsible is the babe unborn that is that we know or may come to know enough of certain inevitable tendencies in biology to consider the fruit of some contemplated union in that direct and clear light of conscience which we can now only fix on the other partner in that union the one duty can conceivably be as definite as or more definite than the other the baby that does not exist can be considered even before the wife who does now it is essential to grasp that this is a comparatively new note in morality of course sane people always thought the aim of marriage was the procreation of children to the glory of god or according to the plan of nature but whether they counted such children as god s reward for service or nature s premium on sanity they always left the reward to god or the premium to nature as a less definable thing the only person and this is the point towards whom one could have precise duties was the partner in the process directly considering the partner s claims was the nearest one could get to indirectly considering the claims of posterity if the women of the harem sang praises of the hero as the moslem mounted his horse it was because this was the due of a man if the christian knight helped his wife off her horse it was because this was the due of a woman definite and detailed dues of this kind they did not predicate of the babe unborn regarding him in that agnostic and opportunist light in which mr browdie regarded the hypothetical child of miss squeers thinking these sex relations healthy they naturally hoped they would produce healthy children but that was all the moslem woman doubtless expected allah to send beautiful sons to an obedient wife but she would not have allowed any direct vision of such sons to alter the obedience itself she would not have said i will now be a disobedient wife as the learned leech informs me that great prophets are often the children of disobedient wives the knight doubtless hoped that the saints would help him to strong children if he did all the duties of his station one of which might be helping his wife off her horse but he would not have refrained from doing this because he had read in a book that a course of falling off horses often resulted in the birth of a genius both moslem and christian would have thought such speculations not only impious but utterly unpractical i quite agree with them but that is not the point here the point here is that a new school believes eugenics against ethics and it is proved by one familiar fact that the heroisms of history are actually the crimes of eugenics the eugenists books and articles are full of suggestions that non eugenic unions should and may come to be regarded as we regard sins that we should really feel that marrying an invalid is a kind of cruelty to children but history is full of the praises of people who have held sacred such ties to invalids of cases like those of colonel hutchinson and sir william temple who remained faithful to betrothals when beauty and health had been apparently blasted and though the illnesses of dorothy osborne and mrs hutchinson may not fall under the eugenic speculations i do not know it is obvious that they might have done so and certainly it would not have made any difference to men s moral opinion of the act i do not discuss here which morality i favour but i insist that they are opposite the eugenist really sets up as saints the very men whom hundreds of families have called sneaks to be consistent they ought to put up statues to the men who deserted their loves because of bodily misfortune with inscriptions celebrating the good eugenist who on his fianc e falling off a bicycle nobly refused to marry her or to the young hero who on hearing of an uncle with erysipelas magnanimously broke his word what is perfectly plain is this that mankind have hitherto held the bond between man and woman so sacred and the effect of it on the children so incalculable that they have always admired the maintenance of honour more than the maintenance of safety doubtless they thought that even the children might be none the worse for not being the children of cowards and shirkers but this was not the first thought the first commandment briefly we may say that while many moral systems have set restraints on sex almost as severe as any eugenist could set they have almost always had the character of securing the fidelity of the two sexes to each other and leaving the rest to god to introduce an ethic which makes that fidelity or infidelity vary with some calculation about heredity is that rarest of all t

history have a queer fascination for me that perhaps has its roots in occurrences or dreams of which this is not the place to speak lastly now and again i read one of the latin or greek authors in a translation since i regret to say that my lack of education does not enable me to do so in the original but for modern fiction i have no taste although from time to time i sample it in a railway train and occasionally am amused by such excursions into the poetic and unreal so it came about that the more good bothered me to read this particular romance the more i determined that i would do nothing of the sort being a persistent person however when he went away about ten o clock at night he deposited it by my side under my nose indeed so that it might not be overlooked thus it came about that i could not help seeing some egyptian hieroglyphics in an oval on the cover also the title and underneath it your own name my friend all of which excited my curiosity especially the title which was brief and enigmatic consisting indeed of one word she i took up the work and on opening it the first thing my eye fell upon was a picture of a veiled woman the sight of which made my heart stand still so painfully did it remind me of a certain veiled woman whom once it had been my fortune to meet glancing from it to the printed page one word seemed to leap at me it was k r now of veiled women there are plenty in the world but were there also two k rs then i turned to the beginning and began to read this happened in the autumn when the sun does not rise till about six but it was broad daylight before i ceased from reading or rather rushing through that book oh what was i to make of it for here in its pages to say nothing of old billali who by the way lied probably to order when he told mr holly that no white man had visited his country for many generations and those gloomy man eating amahagger scoundrels once again i found myself face to face with she who commands now rendered as she who must be obeyed which means much the same thing in her case at least yes with ayesha the lovely the mystic the changeful and the imperious moreover the history filled up many gaps in my own limited experiences of that enigmatical being who was half divine though i think rather wicked or at any rate unmoral in her way and yet all woman it is true that it showed her in lights very different from and higher than those in which she had presented herself to me yet the substratum of her character was the same or rather of her characters for of these she seemed to have several in a single body being as she said of herself to me not one but many and not here but everywhere further i found the story of kallikrates which i had set down as a mere falsehood invented for my bewilderment expanded and explained or rather not explained since perhaps that she might deceive to me she had spoken of this murdered kallikrates without enthusiasm as a handsome person to whom because of an indiscretion of her youth she was bound by destiny and whose return somewhat to her sorrow she must wait at least she did so at first though in the end when she bared her heart at the moment of our farewell she vowed she loved him only and was appointed to him by a divine decree also i found other things of which i knew nothing such as the fire of life with its fatal gift of indefinite existence although i remember that like the giant rezu whom umslopogaas defeated she did talk of a cup of life of which she had drunk that might have been offered to my lips had i been politic bowed the knee and shown more faith in her and her supernatural pretensions lastly i saw the story of her end and as i read it i wept yes i confess i wept although i feel sure that she will return again now i understood why she had quailed and even seemed to shrivel when in my last interview with her stung beyond endurance by her witcheries and sarcasms i had suggested that even for her with all her powers fate might reserve one of its shrewdest blows some prescience had told her that if the words seemed random truth spoke through my lips although and this was the worst of it she did not know what weapon would deal the stroke or when and where it was doomed to fall i was amazed i was overcome but as i closed that book i made up my mind first that i would continue to preserve absolute silence as to ayesha and my dealings with her as during my life i was bound by oath to do and secondly that i would not cause my manuscript to be destroyed i did not feel that i had any right to do so in view of what already had been published to the world there let it lie to appear one day or not to appear as might be fated meanwhile my lips were sealed i would give good back his book without comment and buy another copy one more word it is clear that i did not touch more than the fringe of the real ayesha in a thousand ways she bewitched and deceived me so that i never plumbed her nature s depths perhaps this was my own fault because from the first i shewed a lack of faith in her and she wished to pay me back in her own fashion or perhaps she had other private reasons for her secrecy certainly the character she discovered to me differed in many ways from that which she revealed to mr holly and to leo vincey or kallikrates whom it seems once she slew in her jealousy and rage she told me as much as she thought it fit that i should know and no more allan quatermain the grange yorkshire she and allan chapter i the talisman i believe it was the old egyptians a very wise people probably indeed

with disgust with rage with melancholy and even with self contempt but even at the worst i had an uneasy consciousness that i would have to go back to them an outcast of the islands belongs to those novels of mine that were never laid aside and though it brought me the qualification of exotic writer i don t think the charge was at all justified for the life of me i don t see that there is the slightest exotic spirit in the conception or style of that novel it is certainly the most tropical of my eastern tales the mere scenery got a great hold on me as i went on perhaps because i may just as well confess that the story itself was never very near my heart it engaged my imagination much more than my affection as to my feeling for willems it was but the regard one cannot help having for one s own creation obviously i could not be indifferent to a man on whose head i had brought so much evil simply by imagining him such as he appears in the novel and that too on a very slight foundation the man who suggested willems to me was not particularly interesting in himself my interest was aroused by his dependent position his strange dubious status of a mistrusted disliked worn out european living on the reluctant toleration of that settlement hidden in the heart of the forest land up that sombre stream which our ship was the only white men s ship to visit with his hollow clean shaved cheeks a heavy grey moustache and eyes without any expression whatever clad always in a spotless sleeping suit much befrogged in front which left his lean neck wholly uncovered and with his bare feet in a pair of straw slippers he wandered silently amongst the houses in daylight almost as dumb as an animal and apparently much more homeless i don t know what he did with himself at night he must have had a place a hut a palm leaf shed some sort of hovel where he kept his razor and his change of sleeping suits an air of futile mystery hung over him something not exactly dark but obviously ugly the only definite statement i could extract from anybody was that it was he who had brought the arabs into the river that must have happened many years before but how did he bring them into the river he could hardly have done it in his arms like a lot of kittens i knew that almayer founded the chronology of all his misfortunes on the date of that fateful advent and yet the very first time we dined with almayer there was willems sitting at table with us in the manner of the skeleton at the feast obviously shunned by everybody never addressed by any one and for all recognition of his existence getting now and then from almayer a venomous glance which i observed with great surprise in the course of the whole evening he ventured one single remark which i didn t catch because his articulation was imperfect as of a man who had forgotten how to speak i was the only person who seemed aware of the sound willems subsided presently he retired pointedly unnoticed into the forest maybe its immensity was there within three hundred yards of the verandah ready to swallow up anything almayer conversing with my captain did not stop talking while he glared angrily at the retreating back didn t that fellow bring the arabs into the river nevertheless willems turned up next morning on almayer s verandah from the bridge of the steamer i could see plainly these two breakfasting together t te xa t te and i suppose in dead silence one with his air of being no longer interested in this world and the other raising his eyes now and then with intense dislike it was clear that in those days willems lived on almayer s charity yet on returning two months later to sambir i heard that he had gone on an expedition up the river in charge of a steam launch belonging to the arabs to make some discovery or other on account of the strange reluctance that everyone manifested to talk about willems it was impossible for me to get at the rights of that transaction moreover i was a newcomer the youngest of the company and i suspect not judged quite fit as yet for a full confidence i was not much concerned about that exclusion the faint suggestion of plots and mysteries pertaining to all matters touching almayer s affairs amused me vastly almayer was obviously very much affected i believe he missed willems immensely he wore an air of sinister preoccupation and talked confidentially with my captain i could catch only snatches of mumbled sentences then one morning as i came along the deck to take my place at the breakfast table almayer checked himself in his low toned discourse my captain s face was perfectly impenetrable there was a moment of profound silence and then as if unable to contain himself almayer burst out in a loud vicious tone one thing s certain if he finds anything worth having up there they will poison him like a dog disconnected though it was that phrase as food for thought was distinctly worth hearing we left the river three days afterwards and i never returned to sambir but whatever happened to the protagonist of my willems nobody can deny that i have recorded for him a less squalid fate j c nigger of the narcissus to my readers in america from that evening when james wait joined the ship late for the muster of the crew to the moment when he left us in the open sea shrouded in sailcloth through the open port i had

peaked ranges two days ride took us across country to the segi with this wonderful canyon i was familiar that is as familiar as several visits could make a man with such a bewildering place in fact i had named it deception pass the segi had innumerable branches all more or less the same size and sometimes it was difficult to tell the main canyon from one of its tributaries the walls were rugged and crumbling of a red or yellow hue upward of a thousand feet in height and indented by spruce sided notches there were a number of ruined cliff dwellings the most accessible of which was keet seel i could imagine no more picturesque spot a huge wind worn cavern with a vast slanted stained wall held upon a projecting ledge or shelf the long line of cliff dwellings these silent little stone houses with their vacant black eye like windows had strange power to make me ponder and then dream next day upon resuming our journey it pleased me to try to find the trail to betatakin the most noted and surely the most wonderful and beautiful ruin in all the west in many places there was no trail at all and i encountered difficulties but in the end without much loss of time i entered the narrow rugged entrance of the canyon i had named surprise valley sight of the great dark cave thrilled me as i thought it might have thrilled bess and venters who had lived for me their imagined lives of loneliness here in this wild spot with the sight of those lofty walls and the scent of the dry sweet sage there rushed over me a strange feeling that riders of the purple sage was true my dream people of romance had really lived there once upon a time i climbed high upon the huge stones and along the smooth red walls where pay larkin once had glided with swift sure steps and i entered the musty cliff dwellings and called out to hear the weird and sonorous echoes and i wandered through the thickets and upon the grassy spruce shaded benches never for a moment free of the story i had conceived there something of awe and sadness abided with me i could not enter into the merry pranks and investigations of my party surprise valley seemed a part of my past my dreams my very self i left it haunted by its loneliness and silence and beauty by the story it had given me that night we camped at bubbling spring which once had been a geyser of considerable power wetherill told a story of an old navajo who had lived there for a long time according to the indian tale the old chief resided there without complaining of this geyser that was wont to inundate his fields but one season the unreliable waterspout made great and persistent endeavor to drown him and his people and horses whereupon the old navajo took his gun and shot repeatedly at the geyser and thundered aloud his anger to the great spirit the geyser ebbed away and from that day never burst forth again illustration weird and wonderful monuments in monument valley illustration sunset on the desert illustration cave of the cliff dwellers somewhere under the great bulge of navajo mountain i calculated that we were coming to the edge of the plateau the white bobbing pack horses disappeared and then our extra mustangs it is no unusual thing for a man to use three mounts on this trip then two of our indians disappeared but wetherill waited for us and so did nas ta bega the piute who first took wetherill down into nonnezoshe boco as i came up i thought we had indeed reached the end of the world it s down in there said wetherill with a laugh nas ta bega made a slow sweeping gesture there is always something so significant and impressive about an indian when he points anywhere it is as if he says there way beyond over the ranges is a place i know and it is far the fact was that i looked at the piute s dark inscrutable face before i looked out into the void my gaze then seemed impelled and held by things afar a vast yellow and purple corrugated world of distance apparently now on a level with my eyes i was drawn by the beauty and grandeur of that scene and then i was transfixed almost by fear by the realization that i dared to venture down into this wild and upflung fastness i kept looking afar sweeping the three quarter circle of horizon till my judgment of distance was confounded and my sense of proportion dwarfed one moment and magnified the next wetherill was pointing and explaining but i had not grasped all he said you can see two hundred miles into utah he went on that bright rough surface like a washboard is wind worn rock those little lines of cleavage are canyons there are a thousand canyons down there and only a few have we been in that long purple ragged line is the grand canyon of the colorado and there that blue fork in the red that s where the san juan comes in and there s escalante canyon i had to adopt the indian s method of studying unlimited spaces in the desert to look with slow contracted eyes from near to far the pack train and the drivers had begun to zigzag down a long slope bare of rock with scant strips of green and here and there a cedar half a mile down the slope merged in what seemed a green level but i knew it was not level this level was a

of humiliation jacob felt a little thrill of triumph at the thought of mr bultiwell s three gardeners it took more than gardeners to grow such a rose as he was wearing he liked to fancy that it took personal care personal sympathy personal love the sweetest and rarest flowers must have their special atmosphere quite suddenly mr edward bultiwell laid down his times and glared across at jacob he was a large man with an ugly red face a neck which hung over his collar in rolls and a resonant voice directly he began to speak jacob began to shiver pratt he said am i to understand that the greeting which you offered to the occupants of this carriage when you entered was intended to include me i i certainly meant it to was the tremulous reply then let me beg that such a liberty be not repeated mr bultiwell continued brutally i look upon a man who has compounded with his creditors as a person temporarily at any rate outside the pale of converse with his fellows on er equal terms i look upon your presence in a first class carriage wearing a floral adornment mr bultiwell added with a jealous glance at the very beautiful rose which is to say the least of it conspicuous as er an impertinence to those who have had the misfortune to suffer from your insolvency the healthy colour faded from jacob s cheeks he had the air of one stricken by a lash dazed for the moment and bewildered my rose cost me nothing he faltered and my season ticket doesn t expire till next month i must go up to the city my help is needed with the books mr bultiwell shook his paper preparatory to disappearing behind it your presence here may be considered a matter of taste he fired off as a parting shot i call it damned bad taste mr jacob pratt sat like a hurt thing till the train stopped at the next station then he stumbled out on to the platform and making his way through an unaccountable mist he climbed somehow or other into a third class carriage richard dauncey the melancholy man who lived in the cottage opposite to his looked up at the newcomer s entrance and for the first time within his recollection jacob saw him smile good morning mr pratt the former said with a strenuous attempt at cordiality if you ll excuse my saying so that s the finest rose i ve ever seen in my life richard dauncey made his fortune by that speech and jacob had to swallow very hard and look very fixedly out of the window chapter i precisely two years later jacob pratt sat once more in his cottage sitting room contemplating the remains of a barely tasted breakfast before him read for the fiftieth time were the wonderful letters in his brain a most amazing confusion in his heart an almost hysterical joy presently mrs harris brought in his hat and stick you ll excuse my mentioning it sir she said looking at the former a little disparagingly but brush though i may there s no doing much with this hat of yours the nap s fair gone maybe you haven t noticed it sir but with the summer coming on a straw hat i ll buy a straw hat to day mrs harris jacob promised and you ll be home at the usual time for your supper sir i i expect so i am not quite sure mrs harris i shall be home sometime during the day all right mrs harris shook her head at the sight of the untasted egg you ll excuse my saying so sir she pronounced severely but there s no good work done on an empty stomach times is hard as we all know but eggs is cheap mrs harris jacob reminded her it is two years since i left one of your eggs i left it then because i was miserable i am leaving it this morning because i have had good news i can t eat later on later on mrs harris and a bit of good news is what you deserve sir the latter declared lingering while he cut his accustomed rose with fingers which trembled strangely thank you very much mrs harris he said when i come back to night i ll tell you all about it once more then two years almost to a day after mr edward bultiwell of the great firm of bultiwell and sons had laid down his newspaper and spoken his mind jacob was on his way to the station again wearing a choice rose in his buttonhole he had found no occasion to change his lodgings for he had been an economical man who took great care of his possessions even in the days of his prosperity and his moderate salary as traveller for a bermondsey firm of merchants brought him in quite enough for his simple needs he had to some extent lived down his disgrace the manager of the international stores nodded to him now a trifle condescendingly yet with tacit acknowledgement of the fact that in domestic affairs jacob was a man of principle who always paid his way the greengrocer s wife passed the time of day when not too preoccupied and the newspaper boy no longer clutched for his penny jacob generally met the melancholy man at the corner of the avenue and walked to the station with him and he still grew roses and worshipped them on the way to the station on this particular morning he amazed his friend richard he said i shall not travel to the city with you to day at least i shall not start with you i shall change carriages at wendley as i did once before the devil richard exclaimed they were passing the plate glass window of a new emporium and jacob paused to glance furtively at his reflection he was an exceedingly neat man and his care for his clothes and person had survived two years of impecuniosity nevertheless although he passed muster well enough to the casual observer there were indications in his attire of the inevitable conflict between a desire for adornment and the lack of means to indulge it his too often pressed trousers were thin at the seams his linen thoug

passengers and crew of the liner were glad to dock before dark they took no notice of the rigid erect soldiers lane arm in arm with blair face to the front stood absorbed in his sense of a nameless sublimity for them while passing the statue of liberty the spirit of the first man who ever breathed of freedom for the human race burned as a white flame in the heart of lane and his comrade but it was not so much that spirit which held them erect aloof proud it was a supreme consciousness of immeasurable sacrifice for an ideal that existed only in the breasts of men and women kindred to them an unutterable and never to be spoken glory of the duty done for others but that they owed themselves they had sustained immense loss of health and happiness the future seemed like the gray cold gloomy expanse of the river and there could never be any reward except this white fire of their souls nameless but it was the increasing purpose that ran through the ages the ship docked at dark lane left blair at the rail gloomily gazing down at the confusion and bustle on the wharf and went below to search for their comrade red payson he found him in his stateroom half crouched on the berth apparently oblivious to the important moment it required a little effort to rouse payson he was a slight boy not over twenty two sallow faced and freckled with hair that gave him the only name his comrades knew him by lane packed the boy s few possessions and talked vehemently all the time red braced up ready to go but he had little to say and that with the weary nonchalance habitual with him

of taxicabs and the jangle of trolley cars sounded beyond the wide dark portal of the dock house the murky water below splashed between ship and pier deep voices rang out and merry laughs and shrill glad cries of welcome the bright light shone down upon a motley dark garbed mass moving slowly the spirit of the occasion was manifest when the three disabled soldiers the last passengers to disembark

enough to eat though i am thankful to say that i never have had to do that but to hunt others just for the fun of hunting is something i cannot understand at all and yet that is what men seem to do it for i guess the trouble is they never have been hunted themselves and don t know how it feels sometimes i think i ll hunt one some day just to teach him a lesson what are you laughing at peter at the idea of you hunting a man replied peter your heart is all right lightfoot but you are too timid and gentle to frighten any one big as you are i wouldn t fear you with a single swift bound lightfoot sprang out in front of peter he stamped his sharp hoofs lowered his handsome head until the sharp points of his antlers which people call horns pointed straight at peter lifted the hair along the back of his neck and made a motion as if to plunge at him his eyes which peter had always thought so soft and gentle seemed to flash fire oh cried peter in a faint frightened sounding voice and leaped to one side before it entered his foolish little head that lightfoot was just pretending lightfoot chuckled did you say i couldn t frighten any one he demanded i i didn t know you could look so terribly fierce stammered peter those antlers look really dangerous when you point them that way why why what is that hanging to them it looks like bits of old fur have you been tearing somebody s coat lightfoot peter s eyes were wide with wonder and suspicion chapter ii lightfoot s new antlers peter rabbit was puzzled he stared at lightfoot the deer a wee bit suspiciously have you been tearing somebody s coat he asked again he didn t like to think it of lightfoot whom he always had believed quite as gentle harmless and timid as himself but what else could he think lightfoot slowly shook his head no said he i haven t torn anybody s coat then what are those rags hanging on your antlers demanded peter lightfoot chuckled they are what is left of the coverings of my new antlers he explained what s that what do you mean by new antlers peter was sitting up very straight with his eyes fixed on lightfoot s antlers as though he never had seen them before just what i said retorted lightfoot what do you think of them i think they are the finest antlers i ve ever had when i get the rest of those rags off they will be as handsome a set as ever was grown in the green forest lightfoot rubbed his antlers against the trunk of a tree till some of the rags hanging to them dropped off peter blinked very hard he was trying to understand and he couldn t finally he said so what kind of a story are you trying to fill me up with he demanded indignantly do you mean to tell me that those are not the antlers that you have had as long as i ve known you how can anything hard like those antlers grow and if those are new ones where are the old ones show me the old ones and perhaps i ll believe that these are new ones the idea of trying to make me believe that antlers grow just like plants i ve seen bossy the cow all summer and i know she has got the same horns she had last summer new antlers indeed you are quite right peter quite right about bossy the cow she never has new horns but that isn t any reason why i shouldn t have new antlers is it replied lightfoot patiently her horns are quite different from my antlers i have a new pair every year you haven t seen me all summer have you peter no i don t remember that i have replied peter trying very hard to remember when he had last seen lightfoot i know you haven t retorted lightfoot i know it because i have been hiding in a place you never visit what have you been hiding for demanded peter for my new antlers to grow replied lightfoot when my new antlers are growing i want to be away by myself i don t like to be seen without them or with half grown ones besides i am very uncomfortable while the new antlers are growing and i want to be alone lightfoot spoke as if he really meant every word he said but still peter couldn t he just couldn t believe that those wonderful great antlers had grown out of lightfoot s head in a single summer where did you leave your old ones and when did they come off he asked and there was doubt in the very tone of his voice they dropped off last spring but i don t remember just where replied lightfoot i was too glad to be rid of them to notice where they dropped you see they were loose and uncomfortable and i hadn t any more use for them because i knew that my new ones would be bigger and better i ve got one more point on each than i had last year lightfoot began once more to rub his antlers against the tree to get off the queer rags hanging to them and to polish the points peter watched in silence for a few minutes then all his suspicions returning he said but you haven t told me anything about those rags hanging to your antlers and you haven t believed what i have already told you retorted lightfoot i don t like telling things to people who won t believe me chapter iii lightfoot tells how his antlers grew it is hard to believe what seems impossible and yet what seems impossible to you may be a very commonplace matter to some one else so it does not do to say that a thing cannot be possible just because you cannot understand how it can be peter rabbit wanted to believe what lightfoot the deer had just told him but somehow he couldn t if he had seen those antlers growing it would have been another matter but he hadn t seen lightfoot since the very last of winter and then lightfoot had worn just such handsome antlers as he now had so peter really couldn

tiny graciousness in short of weeness but compare this new york according to another discoverer of america gave me an impression of size of vastness there seemed to be a big ness about it not found in smaller places a third visitor writes new york struck me as hard cruel almost inhuman this i think was because his taxi driver had charged him three dollars the first thing that struck me in new york writes another was the statue of liberty but after all that was only natural it was the first thing that could reach him nor is it only the impressions of the metropolis that seem to fall short of reality let me quote a few others taken at random here and there over the continent i took from pittsburg says an english visitor an impression of something that i could hardly define an atmosphere rather than an idea all very well but after all had he the right to take it granted that pittsburg has an atmosphere rather than an idea the attempt to carry away this atmosphere surely borders on rapacity new orleans writes another visitor opened her arms to me and bestowed upon me the soft and languorous kiss of the caribbean this statement may or may not be true but in any case it hardly seems the fair thing to mention it chicago according to another book of discovery struck me as a large city situated as it is and where it is it seems destined to be a place of importance or here again is a form of impression that recurs again and again at cleveland i felt a distinct note of optimism in the air this same note of optimism is found also at toledo at toronto in short i believe it indicates nothing more than that some one gave the visitor a cigar indeed it generally occurs during the familiar scene in which the visitor describes his cordial reception in an unsuspecting american town thus i was met at the station called in america the depot by a member of the municipal council driving his own motor car after giving me an excellent cigar he proceeded to drive me about the town to various points of interest including the municipal abattoir where he gave me another excellent cigar the carnegie public library the first national bank the courteous manager of which gave me an excellent cigar and the second congregational church where i had the pleasure of meeting the pastor the pastor who appeared a man of breadth and culture gave me another cigar in the evening a dinner admirably cooked and excellently served was tendered to me at a leading hotel and of course he took it after which his statement that he carried away from the town a feeling of optimism explains itself he had four cigars the dinner and half a page of impressions at twenty cents a word nor is it only by the theft of impressions that we suffer at the hands of these english discoverers of america it is a part of the system also that we have to submit to being lectured to by our talented visitors it is now quite understood that as soon as an english literary man finishes a book he is rushed across to america to tell the people of the united states and canada all about it and how he came to write it at home in his own country they don t care how he came to write it he s written it and that s enough but in america it is different one month after the distinguished author s book on the boyhood of botticelli has appeared in london he is seen to land in new york very quietly out of one of the back portholes of the olympic that same afternoon you will find him in an armchair in one of the big hotels giving off impressions of america to a group of reporters after which notices appear in all the papers to the effect that he will lecture in carnegie hall on botticelli the boy the audience is assured beforehand it consists of all the people who feel that they have to go because they know all about botticelli and all the people who feel that they have to go because they don t know anything about botticelli by this means the lecturer is able to rake the whole country from montreal to san francisco with botticelli the boy then he turns round labels his lecture botticelli the man and rakes it all back again all the way across the continent and back he emits impressions estimates of national character and surveys of american genius he sails from new york in a blaze of publicity with his cordon of reporters round him and a month later publishes his book america as i saw it it is widely read in america in the course of time a very considerable public feeling was aroused in the united states and canada over this state of affairs the lack of reciprocity in it seemed unfair it was felt or at least i felt that the time had come when some one ought to go over and take some impressions off england the choice of such a person my choice fell upon myself by an arrangement with the geographical society of america acting in conjunction with the royal geographical society of england to both of whom i communicated my proposal i went at my own expense it is scarcely feasible to give here full details in regard to my outfit and equipment though i hope to do so in a later and more extended account of my expedition suffice it to say that my outfit which was modelled on the equipment of english lecturers in america included a complete suit of clothes a dress shirt for lecturing in a fountain pen and a silk hat the dress shirt i may say for the benefit of other travellers proved invaluable the silk hat however is no longer used in england except perhaps for scrambling eggs in i pass over the details of my pleasant voyage from new york to liverpool

bergson he writes very entertainingly on the structure of the eye of the frog not at all interrupted his friend our philosophy is quite irrelevant the essential is that our philosophy should spring from our point of view and not return upon itself to explain our point of view a philosophy about intuition is somewhat less likely to be intuitive than any other we must avoid having a platform but

of fellow writes poetry and all that there is no likelihood at all of eustace marrying he is of a shy and retiring temperament and sees few women he is almost a recluse sam was aware of this and had frequently regretted it he had always been fond of his cousin and in that half amused and rather patronising way in which men of thews and sinews are fond of the weaker brethren who run more to pallor and intellect and he had always felt that if eustace had not had to retire to windles to spend his life with a woman whom from his earliest years he had always considered the empress of the wash outs much might have been made of him both at school and at oxford eustace had been if not a sport at least a decidedly cheery old bean sam remembered eustace at school breaking gas globes with a slipper in a positively rollicking manner he remembered him at oxford playing up to him manfully at the piano on the occasion when he had done that imitation of frank tinney which had been such a hit at the trinity smoker yes eustace had had the makings of a pretty sound egg and it was too bad that he had allowed his mother to coop him up down in the country miles away from anywhere eustace is returning to england on saturday said mrs hignett she spoke a little wistfully she had not been parted from her son since he had come down from oxford and she would have liked to keep him with her till the end of her lecturing tour that however was out of the question it was imperative that while she was away he should be at windles nothing would have induced her to leave the place at the mercy of servants who might trample over the flower beds scratch the polished floors and forget to cover up the canary at night he sails on the atlantic that s splendid said sam i m sailing on the atlantic myself i ll go down to the office and see if we can t have a state room together but where is he going to live when he gets to england where is he going to live why at windles of course where else but i thought you were letting windles for the summer mrs hignett stared letting windles she spoke as one might address a lunatic what put that extraordinary idea into your head i thought father said something about your letting the place to some american nothing of the kind it seemed to sam that his aunt spoke somewhat vehemently even snappishly in correcting what was a perfectly natural mistake he could not know that the subject of letting windles for the summer was one which had long since begun to infuriate mrs hignett people had certainly asked her to let windles in fact people had pestered her there was a rich fat man an american named bennett whom she had met just before sailing at her brother s house in london invited down to windles for the day mr bennett had fallen in love with the place and had begged her to name her own price not content with this he had pursued her with his pleadings by means of the wireless telegraph while she was on the ocean and had not given up the struggle even when she reached new york he had egged on a friend of his a mr mortimer to continue the persecution in that city and this very morning among the letters on mrs hignett s table the buff envelope of a cable from mr bennett had peeped out nearly spoiling her breakfast no wonder then that sam s allusion to the affair had caused the authoress of the spreading light momentarily to lose her customary calm nothing will induce me ever to let windles she said with finality and rose significantly sam perceiving that the audience was at an end and glad of it also got up well i think i ll be going down and seeing about that state room

in the cathedral of worcester during the years he had served as master of fence at the english court the sons of royalty had learned to thrust and parry and cut as only de vac could teach the art and he had been as conscientious in the discharge of his duties as he had been in his unswerving hatred and contempt for his pupils and now the english king had put upon him such an insult as might only be wiped out by blood as the blow fell the wiry frenchman clicked his heels together and throwing down his foil he stood erect and rigid as a marble statue before his master white and livid was his tense drawn face but he spoke no word he might have struck the king but then there would have been left to him no alternative save death by his own hand for a king may not fight with a lesser mortal and he who strikes a king may not live the king s honor must be satisfied had a french king struck him de vac would have struck back and gloried in the fate which permitted him to die for the honor of france but an english king pooh a dog and who would die for a dog no de vac would find other means of satisfying his wounded pride he would revel in revenge against this man for whom he felt no loyalty if possible he would harm the whole of england if he could but he would bide his time he could afford to wait for his opportunity if by waiting he could encompass a more terrible revenge de vac had been born in paris the son of a french officer reputed the best swordsman in france the son had followed closely in the footsteps of his father until on the latter s death he could easily claim the title of his sire how he had left france and entered the service of john of england is not of this story all the bearing that the life of jules de vac has upon the history of england hinges upon but two of his many attributes his wonderful swordsmanship and his fearful hatred for his adopted country chapter ii south of the armory of westminster palace lay the gardens and here on the third day following the king s affront to de vac might have been a seen a black haired woman gowned in a violet cyclas richly embroidered with gold about the yoke and at the bottom of the loose pointed sleeves which reached almost to the similar bordering on the lower hem of the garment a richly wrought leathern girdle studded with precious stones and held in place by a huge carved buckle of gold clasped the garment about her waist so that the upper portion fell outward over the girdle after the manner of a blouse in the girdle was a long dagger of beautiful workmanship dainty sandals encased her feet while a wimple of violet silk bordered in gold fringe lay becomingly over her head and shoulders by her side walked a handsome boy of about three clad like his companion in gay colors his tiny surcoat of scarlet velvet was rich with embroidery while beneath was a close fitting tunic of white silk his doublet was of scarlet while his long hose of white were cross gartered with scarlet from his tiny sandals to his knees on the back of his brown curls sat a flat brimmed round crowned hat in which a single plume of white waved and nodded bravely at each move of the proud little head the child s features were well molded and his frank bright eyes gave an expression of boyish generosity to a face which otherwise would have been too arrogant and haughty for such a mere baby as he talked with his companion little flashes of peremptory authority and dignity which sat strangely upon one so tiny caused the young woman at times to turn her head from him that he might not see the smiles which she could scarce repress presently the boy took a ball from his tunic and pointing at a little bush near them said stand you there lady maud by yonder bush i would play at toss the young woman did as she was bid and when she had taken her place and turned to face him the boy threw the ball to her thus they played beneath the windows of the armory the boy running blithely after the ball when he missed it and laughing and shouting in happy glee when he made a particularly good catch in one of the windows of the armory overlooking the garden stood a grim gray old man leaning upon his folded arms his brows drawn together in a malignant scowl the corners of his mouth set in a stern cold line he looked upon the garden and the playing child and upon the lovely young woman beneath him but with eyes which did not see for de vac was working out a great problem the greatest of all his life for three days the old man had brooded over his grievance seeking for some means to be revenged upon the king for the insult which henry had put upon him many schemes had presented themselves to his shrewd and cunning mind but so far all had been rejected as unworthy of the terrible satisfaction which his wounded pride demanded his fancies had for the most part revolved about the unsettled political conditions of henry s reign for from these he felt he might wrest that opportunity which could be turned to his own personal uses and to the harm and possibly the undoing of the king for years an inmate of the palace and often a listener in the armory when the king played at sword with his friends and favorites de vac had heard much which passed between henry iii and his intimates that could well be turned to the king s harm by a shrewd and resourceful enemy with all england he knew the utter contempt in which henry held the terms of the magna charta which he so often violated along with his kingly oath to maintain it but what all england did not know de vac had gleaned from scraps of conversation dropped in the armory that henry was even now negotiating with the leaders of foreign mercenaries and with louis ix of france for a sufficient force of knights and men at arms to wage a relentless w

rock came a noise and rush like that of a railway train and a great motor car appeared it topped the crest of cliff black against the sun like a battle chariot rushing to destruction in some wild epic march automatically put out his hand in one futile gesture as if to catch a falling tea cup in a drawing room for the fraction of a flash it seemed to leave the ledge of rock like a flying ship then the very sky seemed to turn over like a wheel and it lay a ruin amid the tall grasses below a line of gray smoke going up slowly from it into the silent air a little lower the figure of a man with gray hair lay tumbled down the steep green slope his limbs lying all at random and his face turned away the eccentric fisherman dropped his net and walked swiftly toward the spot his new acquaintance following him as they drew near there seemed a sort of monstrous irony in the fact that the dead machine was still throbbing and thundering as busily as a factory while the man lay so still he was unquestionably dead the blood flowed in the grass from a hopelessly fatal fracture at the back of the skull but the face which was turned to the sun was uninjured and strangely arresting in itself it was one of those cases of a strange face so unmistakable as to feel familiar we feel somehow that we ought to recognize it even though we do not it was of the broad square sort with great jaws almost like that of a highly intellectual ape the wide mouth shut so tight as to be traced by a mere line the nose short with the sort of nostrils that seem to gape with an appetite for the air the oddest thing about the face was that one of the eyebrows was cocked up at a much sharper angle than the other march thought he had never seen a face so naturally alive as that dead one and its ugly energy seemed all the stranger for its halo of hoary hair some papers lay half fallen out of the pocket and from among them march extracted a card case he read the name on the card aloud sir humphrey turnbull i m sure i ve heard that name somewhere his companion only gave a sort of a little sigh and was silent for a moment as if ruminating then he merely said the poor fellow is quite gone and added some scientific terms in which his auditor once more found himself out of his depth as things are continued the same curiously well informed person it will be more legal for us to leave the body as it is until the police are informed in fact i think it will be well if nobody except the police is informed don t be surprised if i seem to be keeping it dark from some of our neighbors round here then as if prompted to regularize his rather abrupt confidence he said i ve come down to see my cousin at torwood my name is horne fisher might be a pun on my pottering about here mightn t it is sir howard horne your cousin asked march i m going to torwood park to see him myself only about his public work of course and the wonderful stand he is making for his principles i think this budget is the greatest thing in english history if it fails it will be the most heroic failure in english history are you an admirer of your great kinsman mr fisher rather said mr fisher he s the best shot i know then as if sincerely repentant of his nonchalance he added with a sort of enthusiasm no but really he s a beautiful shot as if fired by his own words he took a sort of leap at the ledges of the rock above him and scaled them with a sudden agility in startling contrast to his general lassitude he had stood for some seconds on the headland above with his aquiline profile under the panama hat relieved against the sky and peering over the countryside before his companion had collected himself sufficiently to scramble up after him the level above was a stretch of common turf on which the tracks of the fated car were plowed plainly enough but the brink of it was broken as with rocky teeth broken boulders of all shapes and sizes lay near the edge it was almost incredible that any one could have deliberately driven into such a death trap especially in broad daylight i can t make head or tail of it said march was he blind or blind drunk neither by the look of him replied the other then it was suicide it doesn t seem a cozy way of doing it remarked the man called fisher besides i don t fancy poor old puggy would commit suicide somehow poor old who inquired the wondering journalist did you know this unfortunate man nobody knew him exactly replied fisher with some vagueness but one knew him of course he d been a terror in his time in parliament and the courts and so on especially in that row about the aliens who were deported as undesirables when he wanted one of em hanged for murder he was so sick about it that he retired from the bench since then he mostly motored about by himself but he was coming to torwood too for the week end and i don t see why he should deliberately break his neck almost at the very door i believe hoggs i mean my cousin howard was coming down specially to meet him torwood park doesn t belong to your cousin inquired march no it used to belong to the winthrops you know replied the other now a new man s got it a man from montreal named jenkins hoggs comes for the shooting i told you he was a lovely shot this repeated eulogy on the great social statesman affected harold march as if somebody had defined napoleon as a distinguished

you think you are talking to a norman serf you will please to remember you are in england but if you are not satisfied with my apology i will ride with you a few miles into the country and we will then try with equal arms where the chastisement is to fall the norman put his hand to his dagger but there was an ominous growl from some men who had paused to listen to the quarrel you are an insolent boor wulf of steyning and some day i will punish you as you deserve some day the saxon laughed we shall i hope see you and all your tribe sent across the channel there are few of us here who would not see your backs with pleasure what is this an imperious voice demanded and turning round wulf saw william the norman bishop of london who followed by several monks and pages had pushed his way through the crowd walter fitz urse what means this altercation the saxon ran against me of set purpose my lord walter fitz urse said in tones of deep humility and because i complained he challenged me to ride with him into the country to fight and then he said he hoped that some day all the normans would be sent across the channel is this so the prelate said sternly to wulf did you thus insult not only my page but all of us his countrymen i ran against him by accident wulf said looking up fearlessly in the prelate s face i apologized though i know not that i was more in fault than he but instead of taking my apology as one of gentle blood should do he spoke like a churl and threatened me with chastisement and then i did say that i hoped he and all other normans in the land would some day be packed across the channel your ears ought to be slit as an insolent varlet i meant no insolence my lord bishop and as to the slitting of my ears i fancy earl harold my master would have something to say on that score the prelate was about to reply but glancing at the angry faces of the growing crowd he said coldly i shall lay the matter before him come walter enough of this you are also somewhat to blame for not having received more courteously the apologies of this saucy page the crowd fell back with angry mutterings as he turned and followed by walter fitz urse and the ecclesiastics made his way along the street to the principal entrance of the palace without waiting to watch his departure wulf the saxon page pushed his way through the crowd and went off at full speed to carry the message with which he had been charged our king is a good king a squarely built man whose bare arms with the knotted muscles showing through the skin and hands begrimed with charcoal indicated that he was a smith remarked to a gossip as the little crowd broke up but it is a grievous pity that he was brought up a norman still more that he was not left in peace to pass his life as a monk as he desired he fills the land with his normans soon as an english bishop dies straightway a norman is clapped into his place all the offices at court are filled with them and it is seldom a word of honest english is spoken in the palace the norman castles are rising over the land and his favourites divide among them the territory of every english earl or thane who incurs the king s displeasure were it not for earl harold one might as well be under norman sway altogether nay nay neighbour ulred matters are not so bad as that i dare say they would have been as you say had it not been for earl godwin and his sons but it was a great check that godwin gave them when he returned after his banishment and the norman bishops and nobles hurried across the seas in a panic for years now the king has left all matters in the hands of harold and is well content if only he can fast and pray like any monk and give all his thoughts and treasure to the building of yonder abbey we want neither a monk nor a norman over us the smith said roughly still less one who is both norman and monk i would rather have a dane like canute who was a strong man and a firm one than this king who i doubt not is full of good intentions and is a holy and pious monarch but who is not strong enough for a ruler he leaves it to another to preserve england in peace to keep in order the great earls of mercia and the north to hold the land against harold of norway sweyn and others and above all to watch the normans across the water a monk is well enough in a convent but truly tis bad for a country to have a monk as its king there have been some war loving prelates ulred men as ambitious as any of the great earls and more dangerous because they have learning ay there have been great prelates the smith agreed look at lyfing of worcester to whom next only to godwin the king owed his throne he was an englishman first and a bishop afterwards and was a proof if needed that a man can be a great churchman and a great patriot and statesman too it was he rather than godwin who overcame the opposition of the danish party and got the witan at last to acquiesce in the choice of london and wessex and to give their vote to edward well was it he did so for had he failed we should have had as great a struggle in england as when alfred battled against the danes we of london and the men of wessex under the great earl were bent upon being ruled by a prince of our own blood the last two danish kings had shown us that anything is better than being governed by the northmen it was lyfing who persuaded the earl of mercia to side with wessex rather than with northumbria but since lyfing what great englishman have we had in the church every bishopric was granted by edward to norman priests

which will divide my lecture into two parts direct reasons derived from analysis and its difficulties indirect reasons derived from observation of animals comparative psychology and of the insane and hysterical psycho analysis few things are more firmly established in popular philosophy than the distinction between mind and matter those who are not professional metaphysicians are willing to confess that they do not know what mind actually is or how matter is constituted but they remain convinced that there is an impassable gulf between the two and that both belong to what actually exists in the world philosophers on the other hand have maintained often that matter is a mere fiction imagined by mind and sometimes that mind is a mere property of a certain kind of matter those who maintain that mind is the reality and matter an evil dream are called idealists a word which has a different meaning in philosophy from that which it bears in ordinary life those who argue that matter is the reality and mind a mere property of protoplasm are called materialists they have been rare among philosophers but common at certain periods among men of science idealists materialists and ordinary mortals have been in agreement on one point that they knew sufficiently what they meant by the words mind and matter to be able to conduct their debate intelligently yet it was just in this point as to which they were at one that they seem to me to have been all alike in error the stuff of which the world of our experience is composed is in my belief neither mind nor matter but something more primitive than either both mind and matter seem to be composite and the stuff of which they are compounded lies in a sense between the two in a sense above them both like a common ancestor as regards matter i have set forth my reasons for this view on former occasions and i shall not now repeat them but the question of mind is more difficult and it is this question that i propose to discuss in these lectures a great deal of what i shall have to say is not original indeed much recent work in various fields has tended to show the necessity of such theories as those which i shall be advocating accordingly in this first lecture i shall try to give a brief description of the systems of ideas within which our investigation is to be carried on our knowledge of the external world allen unwin chapters iii and iv also mysticism and logic essays vii and viii if there is one thing that may be said in the popular estimation to characterize mind that one thing is consciousness we say that we are conscious of what we see and hear of what we remember and of our own thoughts and feelings most of us believe that tables and chairs are not conscious we think that when we sit in a chair we are aware of sitting in it but it is not aware of being sat in it cannot for a moment be doubted that we are right in believing that there is some difference between us and the chair in this respect so much may be taken as fact and as a datum for our inquiry but as soon as we try to say what exactly the difference is we become involved in perplexities is consciousness ultimate and simple something to be merely accepted and contemplated or is it something complex perhaps consisting in our way of behaving in the presence of objects or alternatively in the existence in us of things called ideas having a certain relation to objects though different from them and only symbolically representative of them such questions are not easy to answer but until they are answered we cannot profess to know what we mean by saying that we are possessed of consciousness before considering modern theories let us look first at consciousness from the standpoint of conventional psychology since this embodies views which naturally occur when we begin to reflect upon the subject for this purpose let us as a preliminary consider different ways of being conscious first there is the way of perception we perceive tables and chairs horses and dogs our friends traffic passing in the street in short anything which we recognize through the senses i leave on one side for the present the question whether pure sensation is to be regarded as a form of consciousness what i am speaking of now is perception where according to conventional psychology we go beyond the sensation to the thing which it represents when you hear a donkey bray you not only hear a noise but realize that it comes from a donkey when you see a table you not only see a coloured surface but realize that it is hard the addition of these elements that go beyond crude sensation is said to constitute perception we shall have more to say about this at a later stage for the moment i am merely

you think you are talking to a norman serf you will please to remember you are in england but if you are not satisfied with my apology i will ride with you a few miles into the country and we will then try with equal arms where the chastisement is to fall the norman put his hand to his dagger but there was an ominous growl from some men who had paused to listen to the quarrel you are an insolent boor wulf of steyning and some day i will punish you as you deserve some day the saxon laughed we shall i hope see you and all your tribe sent across the channel there are few of us here who would not see your backs with pleasure what is this an imperious voice demanded and turning round wulf saw william the norman bishop of london who followed by several monks and pages had pushed his way through the crowd walter fitz urse what means this altercation the saxon ran against me of set purpose my lord walter fitz urse said in tones of deep humility and because i complained he challenged me to ride with him into the country to fight and then he said he hoped that some day all the normans would be sent across the channel is this so the prelate said sternly to wulf did you thus insult not only my page but all of us his countrymen i ran against him by accident wulf said looking up fearlessly in the prelate s face i apologized though i know not that i was more in fault than he but instead of taking my apology as one of gentle blood should do he spoke like a churl and threatened me with chastisement and then i did say that i hoped he and all other normans in the land would some day be packed across the channel your ears ought to be slit as an insolent varlet i meant no insolence my lord bishop and as to the slitting of my ears i fancy earl harold my master would have something to say on that score the prelate was about to reply but glancing at the angry faces of the growing crowd he said coldly i shall lay the matter before him come walter enough of this you are also somewhat to blame for not having received more courteously the apologies of this saucy page the crowd fell back with angry mutterings as he turned and followed by walter fitz urse and the ecclesiastics made his way along the street to the principal entrance of the palace without waiting to watch his departure wulf the saxon page pushed his way through the crowd and went off at full speed to carry the message with which he had been charged our king is a good king a squarely built man whose bare arms with the knotted muscles showing through the skin and hands begrimed with charcoal indicated that he was a smith remarked to a gossip as the little crowd broke up but it is a grievous pity that he was brought up a norman still more that he was not left in peace to pass his life as a monk as he desired he fills the land with his normans soon as an english bishop dies straightway a norman is clapped into his place all the offices at court are filled with them and it is seldom a word of honest english is spoken in the palace the norman castles are rising over the land and his favourites divide among them the territory of every english earl or thane who incurs the king s displeasure were it not for earl harold one might as well be under norman sway altogether nay nay neighbour ulred matters are not so bad as that i dare say they would have been as you say had it not been for earl godwin and his sons but it was a great check that godwin gave them when he returned after his banishment and the norman bishops and nobles hurried across the seas in a panic for years now the king has left all matters in the hands of harold and is well content if only he can fast and pray like any monk and give all his thoughts and treasure to the building of yonder abbey we want neither a monk nor a norman over us the smith said roughly still less one who is both norman and monk i would rather have a dane like canute who was a strong man and a firm one than this king who i doubt not is full of good intentions and is a holy and pious monarch but who is not strong enough for a ruler he leaves it to another to preserve england in peace to keep in order the great earls of mercia and the north to hold the land against harold of norway sweyn and others and above all to watch the normans across the water a monk is well enough in a convent but truly tis bad for a country to have a monk as its king there have been some war loving prelates ulred men as ambitious as any of the great earls and more dangerous because they have learning ay there have been great prelates the smith agreed look at lyfing of worcester to whom next only to godwin the king owed his throne he was an englishman first and a bishop afterwards and was a proof if needed that a man can be a great churchman and a great patriot and statesman too it was he rather than godwin who overcame the opposition of the danish party and got the witan at last to acquiesce in the choice of london and wessex and to give their vote to edward well was it he did so for had he failed we should have had as great a struggle in england as when alfred battled against the danes we of london and the men of wessex under the great earl were bent upon being ruled by a prince of our own blood the last two danish kings had shown us that anything is better than being governed by the northmen it was lyfing who persuaded the earl of mercia to side with wessex rather than with northumbria but since lyfing what great englishman have we had in the church every bishopric was granted by edward to norman priests until godwin and his sons got the upper hand after their exile since then most of them have been given to germans it wou

smaller places a third visitor writes new york struck me as hard cruel almost inhuman this i think was because his taxi driver had charged him three dollars the first thing that struck me in new york writes another was the statue of liberty but after all that was only natural it was the first thing that could reach him nor is it only the impressions of the metropolis that seem to fall short of reality let me quote a few others taken at random here and there over the continent i took from pittsburg says an english visitor an impression of something that i could hardly define an atmosphere rather than an idea all very well but after all had he the right to take it granted that pittsburg has an atmosphere rather than an idea the attempt to carry away this atmosphere surely borders on rapacity new orleans writes another visitor opened her arms to me and bestowed upon me the soft and languorous kiss of the caribbean this statement may or may not be true but in any case it hardly seems the fair thing to mention it chicago according to another book of discovery struck me as a large city situated as it is and where it is it seems destined to be a place of importance or here again is a form of impression that recurs again and again at cleveland i felt a distinct note of optimism in the air this same note of optimism is found also at toledo at toronto in short i believe it indicates nothing more than that some one gave the visitor a cigar indeed it generally occurs during the familiar scene in which the visitor describes his cordial reception in an unsuspecting american town thus i was met at the station called in america the depot by a member of the municipal council driving his own motor car after giving me an excellent cigar he proceeded to drive me about the town to various points of interest including the municipal abattoir where he gave me another excellent cigar the carnegie public library the first national bank the courteous manager of which gave me an excellent cigar and the second congregational church where i had the pleasure of meeting the pastor the pastor who appeared a man of breadth and culture gave me another cigar in the evening a dinner admirably cooked and excellently served was tendered to me at a leading hotel and of course he took it after which his statement that he carried away from the town a feeling of optimism explains itself he had four cigars the dinner and half a page of impressions at twenty cents a word nor is it only by the theft of impressions that we suffer at the hands of these english discoverers of america it is a part of the system also that we have to submit to being lectured to by our talented visitors it is now quite understood that as soon as an english literary man finishes a book he is rushed across to america to tell the people of the united states and canada all about it and how he came to write it at home in his own country they don t care how he came to write it he s written it and that s enough but in america it is different one month after the distinguished author s book on the boyhood of botticelli has appeared in london he is seen to land in new york very quietly out of one of the back portholes of the olympic that same afternoon you will find him in an armchair in one of the big hotels giving off impressions of america to a group of reporters after which notices appear in all the papers to the effect that he will lecture in carnegie hall on botticelli the boy the audience is assured beforehand it consists of all the people who feel that they have to go because they know all about botticelli and all the people who feel that they have to go because they don t know anything about botticelli by this means the lecturer is able to rake the whole country from montreal to san francisco with botticelli the boy then he turns round labels his lecture botticelli the man and rakes it all back again all the way across the continent and back he emits impressions estimates of national character and surveys of american genius he sails from new york in a blaze of publicity with his cordon of reporters round him and a month later publishes his book america as i saw it it is widely read in america in the course of time a very considerable public feeling was aroused in the united states and canada over this state of affairs the lack of reciprocity in it seemed unfair it was felt or at least i felt that the time had come when some one ought to go over and take some impressions off england the choice of such a person my choice fell upon myself by an arrangement with the geographical society of america acting in conjunction with the royal geographical society of england to both of whom i communicated my proposal i went at my own expense it is scarcely feasible to give here full details in regard to my outfit and equipment though i hope to do so in a later and more extended account of my expedition suffice it to say that my outfit which was modelled on the equipment of english lecturers in america included a complete suit of clothes a dress shirt for lecturing in a fountain pen and a silk hat the dress shirt i may say for the benefit of other travellers proved invaluable the silk hat however is no longer used in england except perhaps for scrambling eggs in i pass over the details of my pleasant voyage from new york to liverpool

crassus you will carry out the orders i will send out the messengers within an hour this very morning there has come news that the barbarians are through the old gap in the wall and their outriders as far south as vinovia the governor shrugged his shoulders these things concern us no longer said he then a bitter smile broke upon his aquiline clean shaven face whom think you that i see in audience this morning nay i know not caradoc and regnus and celticus the icenian who like so many of the richer britons have been educated at rome and who would lay before me their plans as to the ruling of this country and what is their plan that they themselves should do it the roman soldier laughed well they will have their will said he as he saluted and turned upon his heel farewell your excellency there are hard days coming for you and for me an hour later the british deputation was ushered into the presence of the governor they were good steadfast men men who with a whole heart and at some risk to themselves had taken up their country s cause so far as they could see it at the same time they well knew that under the mild and beneficent rule of rome it was only when they passed from words to deeds that their backs or their necks would be in danger they stood now earnest and a little abashed before the throne of the viceroy celticus was a swarthy black bearded little iberian caradoc and regnus were tall middle aged men of the fair flaxen british type all three were dressed in the draped yellow toga after the latin fashion instead of in the brac and tunic which distinguished their more insular fellow countrymen well asked the governor we are here said celticus boldly as the spokesmen of a great number of our fellow countrymen for the purpose of sending our petition through you to the emperor and to the roman senate that we may urge upon them the policy of allowing us to govern this country after our own ancient fashion he paused as if awaiting some outburst as an answer to his own temerity but the governor merely nodded his head as a sign that he should proceed we had laws of our own before ever c sar set foot in britain which have served their purpose since first our forefathers came from the land of ham we are not a child among the nations but our history goes back in our own traditions further even than that of rome and we are galled by this yoke which you have laid upon us are not our laws just asked the governor the code of c sar is just but it is always the code of c sar our own laws were made for our own uses and our own circumstances and we would fain have them again you speak roman as if you had been bred in the forum you wear a roman toga your hair is filleted in roman fashion are not these the gifts of rome we would take all the learning and all the arts that rome or greece could give but we would still be britain and ruled by britons the viceroy smiled by the rood of saint helena said he had you spoken thus to some of my heathen ancestors there would have been an end to your politics that you have dared to stand before my face and say as much is a proof for ever of the gentleness of our rule but i would reason with you for a moment upon this your request you know well that this land has never been one kingdom but was always under many chiefs and many tribes who have made war upon each other would you in very truth have it so again those were in the evil pagan days the days of the druid and the oak grove your excellency but now we are held together by a gospel of peace the viceroy shook his head if all the world were of the same way of thinking then it would be easier said he it may be that this blessed doctrine of peace will be little help to you when you are face to face with strong men who still worship the god of war what would you do against the picts of the north your excellency knows that many of the bravest legionaries are of british blood these are our defence but discipline man the power to command the knowledge of war the strength to act it is in these things that you would fail too long have you leaned upon the crutch the times may be hard but when we have gone through them britain will be herself again nay she will be under a different and a harsher master said the roman already the pirates swarm upon the eastern coast were it not for our roman count of the saxon shore they would land to morrow i see the day when britain may indeed be one but that will be because you and your fellows are either dead or are driven into the mountains of the west all goes into the melting pot and if a better albion should come forth from it it will be after ages of strife and neither you nor your people will have part or lot in it regnus the tall young celt smiled with the help of god and our own right arms we should hope for a better end said he give us but the chance and we will bear the brunt you are as men that are lost said the viceroy sadly i see this broad land with its gardens and orchards its fair villas and its walled towns its bridges and its roads all the work of rome surely it will pass even as a dream and these three hundred years of settled order will leave no trace behind for learn that it will indeed be as you wish and that this very day the orders have come to me that the legions are to go the three britons looked at each

fiftieth time were the wonderful letters in his brain a most amazing confusion in his heart an almost hysterical joy presently mrs harris brought in his hat and stick you ll excuse my mentioning it sir she said looking at the former a little disparagingly but brush though i may there s no doing much with this hat of yours the nap s fair gone maybe you haven t noticed it sir but with the summer coming on a straw hat i ll buy a straw hat to day mrs harris jacob promised and you ll be home at the usual time for your supper sir i i expect so i am not quite sure mrs harris i shall be home sometime during the day all right mrs harris shook her head at the sight of the untasted egg you ll excuse my saying so sir she pronounced severely but there s no good work done on an empty stomach times is hard as we all know but eggs is cheap mrs harris jacob reminded her it is two years since i left one of your eggs i left it then because i was miserable i am leaving it this morning because i have had good news i can t eat later on later on mrs harris and a bit of good news is what you deserve sir the latter declared lingering while he cut his accustomed rose with fingers which trembled strangely thank you very much mrs harris he said when i come back to night i ll tell you all about it once more then two years almost to a day after mr edward bultiwell of the great firm of bultiwell and sons had laid down his newspaper and spoken his mind jacob was on his way to the station again wearing a choice rose in his buttonhole he had found no occasion to change his lodgings for he had been an economical man who took great care of his possessions even in the days of his prosperity and his moderate salary as traveller for a bermondsey firm of merchants brought him in quite enough for his simple needs he had to some extent lived down his disgrace the manager of the international stores nodded to him now a trifle condescendingly yet with tacit acknowledgement of the fact that in domestic affairs jacob was a man of principle who always paid his way the greengrocer s wife passed the time of day when not too preoccupied and the newspaper boy no longer clutched for his penny jacob generally met the melancholy man at the corner of the avenue and walked to the station with him and he still grew roses and worshipped them on the way to the station on this particular morning he amazed his friend richard he said i shall not travel to the city with you to day at least i shall not start with you i shall change carriages at wendley as i did once before the devil richard exclaimed they were passing the plate glass window of a new emporium and jacob paused to glance furtively at his reflection he was an exceedingly neat man and his care for his clothes and person had survived two years of impecuniosity nevertheless although he passed muster well enough to the casual observer there were indications in his attire of the inevitable conflict between a desire for adornment and the lack of means to indulge it his too often pressed trousers were thin at the seams his linen thoug

japonica on brass trays are lit from above by swinging coloured lamps at intervals are stalls laden with fruit and cheroots all is mysterious solemn beautiful a deep burmese gong tolls people emerge from the four staircases that lead up to the platform men women and children all in gala attire the young people conversing gesticulating smiling the older people more subdued carry beads and votive

amongst them the few who hear her shrug their shoulders smile and pass on they are incredulous she goes from group to group but the people turn from her with disdain then the great doors open and the king is seen the girl throws herself oriental fashion in his path her beauty and her pathos arrest his attention and he waves aside those who would interfere she implores the king s protection she is willing to be his slave he listens with deep attention she explains that since her father s death she has been continuously persecuted by the village people on the double count of her italian blood and her poverty the girl invites him to come to her hut in the forest and verify what she says with a gesture he signifies that he will follow where she leads she rises the crowd gathers round all are

trees its trackless paths its indescribable silence the curtain discovers mah phru and the king who expresses his amazement at the loneliness and the poverty of her lot she explains that poverty is not what frightens her but the enmity of those who live yonder and who make it almost impossible for her to sell her cucumbers or her pineapples the king s gaze never leaves the face or figure of the girl he declares that he will protect her that he will build her a home here in the shadow of the loneliness around them he has two years of an unfettered freedom for those years he can command his

enough to eat though i am thankful to say that i never have had to do that but to hunt others just for the fun of hunting is something i cannot understand at all and yet that is what men seem to do it for i guess the trouble is they never have been hunted themselves and don t know how it feels sometimes i think i ll hunt one some day just to teach him a lesson what are you laughing at peter at the idea of you hunting a man replied peter your heart is all right lightfoot but you are too timid and gentle to frighten any one big as you are i wouldn t fear you with a single swift bound lightfoot sprang out in front of peter he stamped his sharp hoofs lowered his handsome head until the sharp points of his antlers which people call horns pointed straight at peter lifted the hair along the back of his neck and made a motion as if to plunge at him his eyes which peter had always thought so soft and gentle seemed to flash fire oh cried peter in a faint frightened sounding voice and leaped to one side before it entered his foolish little head that lightfoot was just pretending lightfoot chuckled did you say i couldn t frighten any one he demanded i i didn t know you could look so terribly fierce stammered peter those antlers look really dangerous when you point them that way why why what is that hanging to them it looks like bits of old fur have you been tearing somebody s coat lightfoot peter s eyes were wide with wonder and suspicion chapter ii lightfoot s new antlers peter rabbit was puzzled he stared at lightfoot the deer a wee bit suspiciously have you been tearing somebody s coat he asked again he didn t like to think it of lightfoot whom he always had believed quite as gentle harmless and timid as himself but what else could he think lightfoot slowly shook his head no said he i haven t torn anybody s coat then what are those rags hanging on your antlers demanded peter lightfoot chuckled they are what is left of the coverings of my new antlers he explained what s that what do you mean by new antlers peter was sitting up very straight with his eyes fixed on lightfoot s antlers as though he never had seen them before just what i said retorted lightfoot what do you think of them i think they are the finest antlers i ve ever had when i get the rest of those rags off they will be as handsome a set as ever was grown in the green forest lightfoot rubbed his antlers against the trunk of a tree till some of the rags hanging to them dropped off peter blinked very hard he was trying to understand and he couldn t finally he said so what kind of a story are you trying to fill me up with he demanded indignantly do you mean to tell me that those are not the antlers that you have had as long as i ve known you how can anything hard like those antlers grow and if those are new ones where are the old ones show me the old ones and perhaps i ll believe that these are new ones the idea of trying to make me believe that antlers grow just like plants i ve seen bossy the cow all summer and i know she has got the same horns she had last summer new antlers indeed you are quite right peter quite right about bossy the cow she never has new horns but that isn t any reason why i shouldn t have new antlers is it replied lightfoot patiently her horns are quite different from my antlers i have a new pair every year you haven t seen me all summer have you peter no i don t remember that i have replied peter trying very hard to remember when he had last seen lightfoot i know you haven t retorted lightfoot i know it because i have been hiding in a place you never visit what have you been hiding for demanded peter for my new antlers to grow replied lightfoot when my new antlers are growing i want to be away by myself i don t like to be seen without them or with half grown ones besides i am very uncomfortable while the new antlers are growing and i want to be alone lightfoot spoke as if he really meant every word he said but still peter couldn t he just couldn t believe that those wonderful great antlers had grown out of lightfoot s head in a single summer where did you leave your old ones and when did they come off he asked and there was doubt in the very tone of his voice they dropped off last spring but i don t remember just where replied lightfoot i was too glad to be rid of them to notice where they dropped you see they were loose and uncomfortable and i hadn t any more use for them because i knew that my new ones would be bigger and better i ve got one more point on each than i had last year lightfoot began once more to rub his antlers against the tree to get off the queer rags hanging to them and to polish the points peter watched in silence for a few minutes then all his suspicions returning he said but you haven t told me anything about those rags hanging to your antlers and you haven t believed what i have already told you retorted lightfoot i don t like telling things to people who won t believe me chapter iii lightfoot tells how his antlers grew it is hard to believe what seems impossible and yet what seems impossible to you may be a very commonplace matter to some one else so it does not do to say that a thing cannot be possible just because you cannot understand how it can be peter rabbit wanted to believe what lightfoot the deer had just told him but somehow he couldn t if he had seen those antlers growing it would have been another matter but he hadn t seen lightfoot since the very last of winter and then lightfoot had worn just such handsome antlers as he now had so peter really couldn

of an evening to watch the sun set over the sea of yellow corn and the high green elms beyond which divide the cornfields from the maidenhead thicket an old agricultural labourer he had a grey face and grey hair and throat beard he stooped a good deal and struck me as being very feeble and long past work but he told me that he still did some work in the fields the older farmers who had employed him for many years past gave him a little to do he also had his old age pension and his children helped to keep him in comfort he was quite well off he said compared to many there was a subdued and sombre cheerfulness in him and when i questioned him about his early life he talked very freely in his slow old peasant way he was born in a village in the vale of aylesbury and began work as a ploughboy on a very big farm he had a good master and was well fed the food being bacon vegetables and homemade bread also suet pudding three times a week but what he remembered best was a rice pudding which came by chance in his way during his first year on the farm there was some of the pudding left in a dish after the family had dined and the farmer said to his wife give it to the boy so he had it and never tasted anything so nice in all his life how he enjoyed that pudding he remembered it now as if it had been yesterday though it was sixty five years ago he then went on to talk of the changes that had been going on in the world since that happy time but the greatest change of all was in the appearance of things he had had a hard life and the hardest time was when he was a ploughboy and had to work so hard that he was tired to death at the end of every day yet at four o clock in the morning he was ready and glad to get up and go out to work all day again because everything looked so bright and it made him happy just to look up at the sky and listen to the birds in those days there were larks the number of larks was wonderful the sound of their singing filled the whole air he didn t want any greater happiness than to hear them singing over his head a few days ago not more than half a mile from where we were standing he was crossing a field when a lark got up singing near him and went singing over his head he stopped to listen and said to himself well now that do remind me of old times for you know he went on it is a rare thing to hear a lark now what s become of all the birds i used to see i don t know i remember there was a very pretty bird at that time called the yellow hammer a bird all a shining yellow the prettiest of all the birds he never saw nor heard that bird now he assured me that was how the old man talked and i never told him that yellow hammers could be seen and heard all day long anywhere on the common beyond the green wall of the elms and that a lark was singing loudly high up over our heads while he was talking of the larks he had listened to sixty five years ago in the vale of aylesbury and saying that it was a rare thing to hear that bird now iii as a tree falls at the green dragon where i refreshed myself at noon with bread and cheese and beer i was startlingly reminded of a simple and i suppose familiar psychological fact yet one which we are never conscious of except at rare moments when by chance it is thrust upon us there are many green dragons in this world of wayside inns even as there are many white harts red lions silent women and other incredible things but when i add that my inn is in a wiltshire village the headquarters of certain gentlemen who follow a form of sport which has long been practically obsolete in this country and indeed throughout the civilised world some of my readers will have no difficulty in identifying it after lunching i had an hour s pleasant conversation with the genial landlord and his buxom good looking wife they were both natives of a new forest village and glad to talk about it with one who knew it intimately during our talk i happened to use the words i forget what about as a tree falls so must it lie the landlady turned on me her dark hampshire eyes with a sudden startled and pained look in them and cried oh please don t say that why not i asked it is in the bible and a quite common saying i know she returned but i can t bear it i hate to hear it she would say no more but my curiosity was stirred and i set about persuading her to tell me ah yes i said i can guess why it s something in your past life a sad story of one of your family one very much loved perhaps who got into trouble and was refused all help from those who might have saved him no she said it all happened before my time long before i never knew her and then presently she told me the story when her father was a young man he lived and worked with his father a farmer in hampshire and a widower there were several brothers and sisters and one of the sisters named eunice was most loved by all of them and was her father s favourite on account of her beauty and sweet disposition unfortunately she became engaged to a young man who was not liked by the father and when she refused to break her engagement to please him he was dreadfully angry and told her that if she went against him and threw herself away on that worthless fellow he would forbid her the house and would never see or speak to her again being of an affectionate disposition and fond of her father it grieved her sorely to disobey him but her love compelled her and by and by she went away and was married in a neighbouring village where her lover had his home it was not a happy marriage and after a few anxious years she fell into a wasting illness and when it became known to her that she was near her end she sent a message by a brother to the old father to come and see her before s

emotions and will xv characteristics of mental phenomena the analysis of mind lecture i recent criticisms of consciousness there are certain occurrences which we are in the habit of calling mental among these we may take as typical believing and desiring the exact definition of the word mental will i hope emerge as the lectures proceed for the present i shall mean by it whatever occurrences would commonly be called mental i wish in these lectures to analyse as fully as i can what it is that really takes place when we e g believe or desire in this first lecture i shall be concerned to refute a theory which is widely held and which i formerly held myself the theory that the essence of everything mental is a certain quite peculiar something called consciousness conceived either as a relation to objects or as a pervading quality of psychical phenomena the reasons which i shall give against this theory will be mainly derived from previous authors there are two sorts of reasons which will divide my lecture into two parts direct reasons derived from analysis and its difficulties indirect reasons derived from observation of animals comparative psychology and of the insane and hysterical psycho analysis few things are more firmly established in popular philosophy than the distinction between mind and matter those who are not professional metaphysicians are willing to confess that they do not know what mind actually is or how matter is constituted but they remain convinced that there is an impassable gulf between the two and that both belong to what actually exists in the world philosophers on the other hand have maintained often that matter is a mere fiction imagined by mind and sometimes that mind is a mere property of a certain kind of matter those who maintain that mind is the reality and matter an evil dream are called idealists a word which has a different meaning in philosophy from that which it bears in ordinary life those who argue that matter is the reality and mind a mere property of protoplasm are called materialists they have been rare among philosophers but common at certain periods among men of science idealists materialists and ordinary mortals have been in agreement on one point that they knew sufficiently what they meant by the words mind and matter to be able to conduct their debate intelligently yet it was just in this point as to which they were at one that they seem to me to have been all alike in error the stuff of which the world of our experience is composed is in my belief neither mind nor matter but something more primitive than either both mind and matter seem to be composite and the stuff of which they are compounded lies in a sense between the two in a sense above them both like a common ancestor as regards matter i have set forth my reasons for this view on former occasions and i shall not now repeat them but the question of mind is more difficult and it is this question that i propose to discuss in these lectures a great deal of what i shall have to say is not original indeed much recent work in various fields has tended to show the necessity of such theories as those which i shall be advocating accordingly in this first lecture i shall try to give a brief description of the systems of ideas within which our investigation is to be carried on our knowledge of the external world allen unwin chapters iii and iv also mysticism and logic essays vii and viii if there is one thing that may be said in the popular estimation to characterize mind that one thing is consciousness we say that we are conscious of what we see and hear of what we remember and of our own thoughts and feelings most of us believe that tables and chairs are not conscious we think that when we sit in a chair we are aware of sitting in it but it is not aware of being sat in it cannot for a moment be doubted that we are right in believing that there is some difference between us and the chair in this respect so much may be taken as fact and as a datum for our inquiry but as soon as we try to say what exactly the difference is we become involved in perplexities is consciousness ultimate and simple something to be merely accepted and contemplated or is it something complex perhaps consisting in our way of behaving in the presence of objects or alternatively in the existence in us of things called ideas having a certain relation to objects though different from them and only symbolically representative of them such questions are not easy to answer but until they are answered we cannot profess to know what we mean by saying that we are possessed of consciousness before considering modern theories let us look first at consciousness from the standpoint of conventional psychology since this embodies views which naturally occur when we begin to reflect upon the subject for this purpose let us as a preliminary consider different ways of being conscious first there is the way of perception we perceive tables and chairs horses and dogs our friends traffic passing in the street in short anything which we recognize through the senses i leave on one side for the present the question whether pure sensation is to be regarded as a form of consciousness what i am speaking of now is perception where according to conventional psychology we go beyond the sensation to the thing which it represents when you hear a donkey bray you not only hear a noise but realize that it comes from a donkey when you see a table you not only see a coloured surface but realize that it is hard the addition of these elements that go beyond crude sensation is said to constitute perception we shall have more to say about this at a later stage for the moment i am merely

flower gardens below and the rocks almost covered by the full swelling tide tall and looking slimmer than ever in his plain dinner garb there were some indications of an hour of strange and unexpected suffering in the tired face of the man who gazed out in somewhat dazed fashion at the little panorama which he had been looking forward so eagerly to seeing again throughout the long journey down from town he had felt an unusual and almost boyish enthusiasm for his coming holiday he had thought of his tennis racquet and fishing rods wondered about his golf clubs and his guns even the unexpected encounter with miller had done little more than leave an unpleasant taste in his mouth and then on his way down from up over as the natives called that little strip of moorland overhead he had

a touch of rouge upon her cheeks and the unscreened evening sunlight was scarcely kind to her rather wan features and carefully arranged complexion she still had her claims to beauty however tallente admitted that to himself as he stood there appraising her with a strange and almost impersonal regard his wife of thirteen years she was beautiful notwithstanding the strained look of anxiety which at

tumultuous tomb he put it down again shook his head and sighed what genius i had then he reflected echoing the aged swift it was nearly six months since the book had been published he was glad to think he would never write anything of the same sort again who could have been reading it he wondered anne perhaps he liked to think so perhaps too she had at last recognised herself in the hamadryad

came out hoping that the poem would tell her what he hadn t dared to say she had never referred to it he shut his eyes and saw a vision of her in a red velvet cloak swaying into the little restaurant

with disgust with rage with melancholy and even with self contempt but even at the worst i had an uneasy consciousness that i would have to go back to them an outcast of the islands belongs to those novels of mine that were never laid aside and though it brought me the qualification of exotic writer i don t think the charge was at all justified for the life of me i don t see that there is the slightest exotic spirit in the conception or style of that novel it is certainly the most tropical of my eastern tales the mere scenery got a great hold on me as i went on perhaps because i may just as well confess that the story itself was never very near my heart it engaged my imagination much more than my affection as to my feeling for willems it was but the regard one cannot help having for one s own creation obviously i could not be indifferent to a man on whose head i had brought so much evil simply by imagining him such as he appears in the novel and that too on a very slight foundation the man who suggested willems to me was not particularly interesting in himself my interest was aroused by his dependent position his strange dubious status of a mistrusted disliked worn out european living on the reluctant toleration of that settlement hidden in the heart of the forest land up that sombre stream which our ship was the only white men s ship to visit with his hollow clean shaved cheeks a heavy grey moustache and eyes without any expression whatever clad always in a spotless sleeping suit much befrogged in front which left his lean neck wholly uncovered and with his bare feet in a pair of straw slippers he wandered silently amongst the houses in daylight almost as dumb as an animal and apparently much more homeless i don t know what he did with himself at night he must have had a place a hut a palm leaf shed some sort of hovel where he kept his razor and his change of sleeping suits an air of futile mystery hung over him something not exactly dark but obviously ugly the only definite statement i could extract from anybody was that it was he who had brought the arabs into the river that must have happened many years before but how did he bring them into the river he could hardly have done it in his arms like a lot of kittens i knew that almayer founded the chronology of all his misfortunes on the date of that fateful advent and yet the very first time we dined with almayer there was willems sitting at table with us in the manner of the skeleton at the feast obviously shunned by everybody never addressed by any one and for all recognition of his existence getting now and then from almayer a venomous glance which i observed with great surprise in the course of the whole evening he ventured one single remark which i didn t catch because his articulation was imperfect as of a man who had forgotten how to speak i was the only person who seemed aware of the sound willems subsided presently he retired pointedly unnoticed into the forest maybe its immensity was there within three hundred yards of the verandah ready to swallow up anything almayer conversing with my captain did not stop talking while he glared angrily at the retreating back didn t that fellow bring the arabs into the river nevertheless willems turned up next morning on almayer s verandah from the bridge of the steamer i could see plainly these two breakfasting together t te xa t te and i suppose in dead silence one with his air of being no longer interested in this world and the other raising his eyes now and then with intense dislike it was clear that in those days willems lived on almayer s charity yet on returning two months later to sambir i heard that he had gone on an expedition up the river in charge of a steam launch belonging to the arabs to make some discovery or other on account of the strange reluctance that everyone manifested to talk about willems it was impossible for me to get at the rights of that transaction moreover i was a newcomer the youngest of the company and i suspect not judged quite fit as yet for a full confidence i was not much concerned about that exclusion the faint suggestion of plots and mysteries pertaining to all matters touching almayer s affairs amused me vastly almayer was obviously very much affected i believe he missed willems immensely he wore an air of sinister preoccupation and talked confidentially with my captain i could catch only snatches of mumbled sentences then one morning as i came along the deck to take my place at the breakfast table almayer checked himself in his low toned discourse my captain s face was perfectly impenetrable there was a moment of profound silence and then as if unable to contain himself almayer burst out in a loud vicious tone one thing s certain if he finds anything worth having up there they will poison him like a dog disconnected though it was that phrase as food for thought was distinctly worth hearing we left the river three days afterwards and i never returned to sambir but whatever happened to the protagonist of my willems nobody can deny that i have recorded for him a less squalid fate j c nigger of the narcissus to my readers in america from that evening when james wait joined the ship late for the muster of the crew to the moment when he left us in the open sea shrouded in sailcloth through the open port i had much to do with him he was in my watch a negro in a british forecastle is a lonely being he has no chums yet james wait afraid of death and making her his accomplice was an impostor of some character mastering our compassion scornful of our sentimentalism triumphing over our suspicions but in the book he is nothing he is merely the centre of the ship s collective psychology and the pivot

there was a brief silence during which nigel knowing his uncle s humours leaned back in his chair and waited upon the table was a little pile of closely written manuscript and by their side several black bound code books upon which the f o private still remained though almost obliterated with time lord dorminster s occupation was apparent he was decoding a message of unusual length presently he turned away from the table however and faced his nephew his hands travelled to his waistcoat pocket he drew out a cigarette from a thin gold case lit it and began to smoke then he crossed his legs and leaned a little farther back in his chair nigel he said we are living in strange times no one denies that sir was the grave assent lord dorminster glanced at the calendar which stood upon the desk to day he continued is the twenty third day of march nineteen hundred and thirty four fifteen years ago that terrible peace treaty was signed since then you know what the history of our country has been i am not blowing my own trumpet when i say that nearly every man with true political insight has been cast adrift at the present moment the country is in the hands of a body of highly respectable and well meaning men who as a parish council might conduct the affairs of dorminster town with unqualified success as statesmen they do not exist it seems to me nigel that you and i are going to see in reality that spectre which terrified the world twenty years ago we are going to see the breaking up of a mighty empire tell me what has happened or is going to happen nigel begged well for one thing his uncle replied the emperor of the east is preparing for a visit to europe he will be here probably next month you know whom i mean of course prince shan nigel exclaimed prince shan of china lord dorminster assented his coming links up many things which had been puzzling me i tell you nigel what happens during prince shan s visit will probably decide the destinies of this country and yet i wouldn t mind betting you a thousand to one that there isn t a single official of the government who has the slightest idea as to why he is coming or that he is coming at all do you know nigel asked i can only surmise let us leave prince shan for the moment nigel now listen you go about a great deal what do people say about me honestly i mean speak with your face to the light they call you a faddist and a scaremonger nigel confessed yet there are one or two especially at the st philip s club diplomatists and ambassadors whose place in the world has passed away who think and believe differently you know sir that i am amongst them lord dorminster nodded kindly well he said i fancy i am about to prove myself seven years ago it was he went on reminiscently when the new national party came into supreme power you know one of their first battle cries down with all secret treaties down with all secret diplomacy let nothing exist but an honest commercial understanding between the different countries of the world how germany and russia howled with joy in place of an english statesman with his country s broad interests at heart we have in berlin and petrograd half a dozen representatives of the great industries whose object in their own words is i believe to develop friendly commercialism and a feeling of brotherhood between the nations not only our ambassadors but our secret service were swept clean out of existence i remember going to broadley the day he was appointed foreign minister and i asked him a simple question i asked him whether he did not consider it his duty to keep his finger upon the pulses of the other great nations however friendly they might seem to keep himself assured that all these expressions of good will were honourable and that in the heart of the german nation that great craving for revenge which is the natural heritage of the present generation had really become dissipated broadley smiled at me lord dorminster he said the chief cause of wars in the past has been suspicion we look upon espionage as a disgraceful practice it is the people of germany with whom we are in touch now not a military oligarchy and the people of germany no more desire war than we do besides there is the league of nations those were broadley s views then and they are his views to day you know what i did nigel assented cautiously i suppose it is an open secret amongst a few of us he observed you have been running an unofficial secret service of your own precisely i have had a few agents at work for over a year and when i have finished decoding this last dispatch i shall have evidence which will prove beyond a doubt that we are on the threshold of terrible events the worst of it is well we have been found out what do you mean nigel asked quickly his uncle s sensitive lips quivered you knew sidwell quite well sidwell was found stabbed to the heart in a caf in petrograd three weeks ago lord dorminster announced an official report of the enquiry into his death informs his relatives that his death was due to a quarrel with some russian sailors over one of the women of the quarter where he was found horrible nigel muttered

reverse direction by reducing the principles of mechanics to those of electricity and this especially as confidence in the strict validity of the equations of newton s mechanics was shaken by the experiments with beta rays and rapid kathode rays this dualism still confronts us in unextenuated form in the theory of hertz where matter appears not only as the bearer of velocities kinetic energy and mechanical pressures but also as the bearer of electromagnetic fields since such fields also occur in vacuo i e in free ether the ether also appears as bearer of electromagnetic fields the ether appears indistinguishable in its functions from ordinary matter within matter it takes part in the motion of matter and in empty space it has everywhere a velocity so that the ether has a definitely assigned velocity throughout the whole of space there is no fundamental difference between hertz s ether and ponderable matter which in part subsists in the ether the hertz theory suffered not only from the defect of ascribing to matter and ether on the one hand mechanical states and on the other hand electrical states which do not stand in any conceivable relation to each other it was also at variance with the result of fizeau s important experiment on the velocity of the propagation of light in moving fluids and with other established experimental results such was the state of things when h a lorentz entered upon the scene he brought theory into harmony with experience by means of a wonderful simplification of theoretical principles he achieved this the most important advance in the theory of electricity since maxwell by taking from ether its mechanical and from matter its electromagnetic qualities as in empty space so too in the interior of material bodies the ether and not matter viewed atomistically was exclusively the seat of electromagnetic fields according to lorentz the elementary particles of matter alone are capable of carrying out movements their electromagnetic activity is entirely confined to the carrying of electric charges thus lorentz succeeded in reducing all electromagnetic happenings to maxwell s equations for free space as to the mechanical nature of the lorentzian ether it may be said of it in a somewhat playful spirit that immobility is the only mechanical property of which it has not been deprived by h a lorentz it may be added that the whole change in the conception of the ether which the special theory of relativity brought about consisted in taking away from the ether its last mechanical quality namely its immobility how this is to be understood will forthwith be expounded the space time theory and the kinematics of the special theory of relativity were modelled on the maxwell lorentz theory of the electromagnetic field this theory therefore satisfies the conditions of the special theory of relativity but when viewed from the latter it acquires a novel aspect for if k be a system of co ordinates relatively to which the lorentzian ether is at rest the maxwell lorentz equations are valid primarily with reference to k but by the special theory of relativity the same equations without any change of meaning also hold in relation to any new system of co ordinates k which is moving in uniform translation relatively to k now comes the anxious question why must i in the theory distinguish the k system above all k systems which are physically equivalent to it in all respects by assuming that the ether is at rest relatively to the k system for the theoretician such an asymmetry in the theoretical structure with no corresponding asymmetry in the system of experience is intolerable if we assume the ether to be at rest relatively to k but in motion relatively to k the physical equivalence of k and k seems to me from the logical standpoint not indeed downright incorrect but nevertheless inacceptable the next position which it was possible to take up in face of this state of things appeared to be the following the ether does not exist at all the electromagnetic fields are not states of a medium and are not bound down to any bearer but they are independent realities which are not reducible to anything else exactly like the atoms of ponderable matter this conception suggests itself the more readily as according to lorentz s theory electromagnetic radiation like ponderable matter brings impulse and energy with it and as according to the special theory of relativity both matter and radiation are but special forms of distributed energy ponderable mass losing its isolation and appearing as a special form of energy more careful reflection teaches us however that the special theory of relativity does not compel us to deny ether we may assume the existence of an ether only we must give up ascribing a definite state of motion to it i e we must by abstraction take from it the last mechanical characteristic which lorentz had still left it we shall see later that this point of view the conceivability of which i shall at once endeavour to make more intelligible by a somewhat halting comparison is justified by the results of the general theory of relativity think of waves on the surface of water here we can describe two entirely different things either we may observe how the undulatory surface forming the boundary between water and air alters in the course of time or else with the help of small floats for instance we can observe how the position of the separate particles of water alters in the course of time if the existence of such floats for tracking the motion of the particles of a fluid were a fundamental impossibility in physics if in fact nothing else whatever were observable than the shape of the space occupied by the water as it varies in time we should have no ground for

others were led by them to concentrate exclusively on circumstantial selection as the explanation of all the transformations and adaptations which were the evidence for evolution and they presently found themselves so cut off by this specialization from the majority who knew darwin only by his spurious reputation that they were obliged to distinguish themselves not as darwinians but as neo darwinians before ten more years had elapsed the neo darwinians were practically running current science it was i was fifty i published my own view of evolution in a play called man and superman and i found that most people were unable to understand how i could be an evolutionist and not a neo darwinian or why i habitually derided neo darwinism as a ghastly idiocy and would fall on its professors slaughterously in public discussions it was in the hope of making me clear the matter up that the fabian society which was then organizing a series of lectures on prophets of the nineteenth century asked me to deliver a lecture on the prophet darwin i did so and scraps of that lecture which was never published variegate these pages political inadequacy of the human animal ten more years elapsed neo darwinism in politics had produced a european catastrophe of a magnitude so appalling and a scope so unpredictable that as i write these lines in it is still far from certain whether our civilization will survive it the circumstances of this catastrophe the boyish cinema fed romanticism which made it possible to impose it on the people as a crusade and especially the ignorance and errors of the victors of western europe when its violent phase had passed and the time for reconstruction arrived confirmed a doubt which had grown steadily in my mind during my forty years public work as a socialist namely whether the human animal as he exists at present is capable of solving the social problems raised by his own aggregation or as he calls it his civilization cowardice of the irreligious another observation i had made was that goodnatured unambitious men are cowards when they have no religion they are dominated and exploited not only by greedy and often half witted and half alive weaklings who will do anything for cigars champagne motor cars and the more childish and selfish uses of money but by able and sound administrators who can do nothing else with them than dominate and exploit them government and exploitation become synonymous under such circumstances and the world is finally ruled by the childish the brigands and the blackguards those who refuse to stand in with them are persecuted and occasionally executed when they give any trouble to the exploiters they fall into poverty when they lack lucrative specific talents at the present moment one half of europe having knocked the other half down is trying to kick it to death and may succeed a procedure which is logically sound neo darwinism and the goodnatured majority are looking on in helpless horror or allowing themselves to be persuaded by the newspapers of their exploiters that the kicking is not only a sound commercial investment but an act of divine justice of which they are the ardent instruments but if man is really incapable of organizing a big civilization and cannot organize even a village or a tribe any too well what is the use of giving him a religion a religion may make him hunger and thirst for righteousness but will it endow him with the practical capacity to satisfy that appetite good intentions do not carry with them a grain of political science which is a very complicated one the most devoted and indefatigable the most able and disinterested students of this science in england as far as i know are my friends sidney and beatrice webb it has taken them forty years of preliminary work in the course of which they have published several treatises comparable to adam smith s wealth of nations to formulate a political constitution adequate to existing needs if this is the measure of what can be done in a lifetime by extraordinary ability keen natural aptitude exceptional opportunities and freedom from the preoccupations of bread winning what are we to expect from the parliament man to whom political science is as remote and distasteful as the differential calculus and to whom such an elementary but vital point as the law of economic rent is a pons asinorum never to be approached much less crossed or from the common voter who is mostly so hard at work all day earning a living that he cannot keep awake for five minutes over a book is there any hope in education the usual answer is that we must educate our masters that is ourselves we must teach citizenship and political science at school but must we there is no must about it the hard fact being that we must not teach political science or citizenship at school the schoolmaster who attempted it would soon find himself penniless in the streets without pupils if not in the dock pleading to a pompously worded indictment for sedition against the exploiters our schools teach the morality of feudalism corrupted by commercialism and hold up the military conqueror the robber baron and the profiteer as models of the illustrious and the successful in vain do the prophets who see through this imposture preach and teach a better gospel the individuals whom they convert are doomed to pass

enough to eat though i am thankful to say that i never have had to do that but to hunt others just for the fun of hunting is something i cannot understand at all and yet that is what men seem to do it for i guess the trouble is they never have been hunted themselves and don t know how it feels sometimes i think i ll hunt one some day just to teach him a lesson what are you laughing at peter at the idea of you hunting a man replied peter your heart is all right lightfoot but you are too timid and gentle to frighten any one big as you are i wouldn t fear you with a single swift bound lightfoot sprang out in front of peter he stamped his sharp hoofs lowered his handsome head until the sharp points of his antlers which people call horns pointed straight at peter lifted the hair along the back of his neck and made a motion as if to plunge at him his eyes which peter had always thought so soft and gentle seemed to flash fire oh cried peter in a faint frightened sounding voice and leaped to one side before it entered his foolish little head that lightfoot was just pretending lightfoot chuckled did you say i couldn t frighten any one he demanded i i didn t know you could look so terribly fierce stammered peter those antlers look really dangerous when you point them that way why why what is that hanging to them it looks like bits of old fur have you been tearing somebody s coat

head no said he i haven t torn anybody s coat then what are those rags hanging on your antlers demanded peter lightfoot chuckled they are what is left of the coverings of my new antlers he explained what s that what do you mean by new antlers peter was sitting up very straight with his eyes fixed on lightfoot s antlers as though he never had seen them before just what i said retorted lightfoot what do you think of them i think they are the finest antlers i ve ever had when i get the rest of those rags off they will be as handsome a set as ever was grown in the green forest lightfoot rubbed his antlers against the trunk of a tree till some of the rags hanging to them dropped off peter blinked very hard he was trying to understand and he couldn t finally he said so what kind of a story are you trying to fill me up with he demanded indignantly do you mean to tell me that those are not the antlers that you have had as long as i ve known you how can anything hard like those antlers

ve seen bossy the cow all summer and i know she has got the same horns she had last summer new antlers indeed you are quite right peter quite right about bossy the cow she never has new horns but that isn t any reason why i shouldn t have new antlers is it replied lightfoot patiently her horns are quite different from my antlers i have a new pair every year you haven t seen me all summer have you peter no i don t remember that i have replied peter trying very hard to remember when he had last seen lightfoot i know you haven t retorted lightfoot i know it because i have been hiding in a place you never visit what have you been hiding for demanded peter for my new antlers to grow replied lightfoot when my new antlers are growing i want to be away by myself i don t like to be seen without

he just couldn t believe that those wonderful great antlers had grown out of lightfoot s head in a single summer where did you leave your old ones and when did they come off he asked and there was doubt in the very tone of his voice they dropped off last spring but i don t remember just where replied lightfoot i was too glad to be rid of them to notice where they dropped you see they were loose and uncomfortable and i hadn t any more use for them because i knew that my new ones would be bigger and better i ve got one more point on each than i had last year lightfoot began once more to rub his antlers against the tree to get off the queer rags hanging to them and to polish the points peter watched in silence for a few minutes then all his suspicions returning he said but you haven t told me anything about those rags hanging to your antlers and you haven t believed what i have already told you retorted lightfoot i don t like telling things to people who won t believe me chapter iii lightfoot tells how his antlers grew it is hard to believe what seems impossible and yet what seems impossible to you may be a very commonplace matter to some one else so it does not do to say that a thing cannot be possible just because you cannot understand how it can be peter rabbit wanted to believe what lightfoot the deer had just told him but somehow he couldn t if he had seen those antlers growing it would have been another matter but he hadn t seen lightfoot since the very last of winter and then lightfoot had worn just such handsome antlers as he now had so peter really couldn

was seven years old large for his age a bold handsome lad with red hair mrs smith made a bargain with dick and led him back with her here panhandle took violent exception to having his pets killed or routed out by this boy he had never before seen he did not like his looks anyway but dick paid little heed to panhandle except once when mrs smith went into the house and then he knocked panhandle down for once panhandle did not squall he got up round eyed pale with his hands clenched he never said a word something was born in the depths of his gentle soul then dick tore a hole in the little wall of rocks that supported the porch and with a lighted torch on a stick he wormed his way in to rout out the skunks panhandle suddenly was thrilled and frightened by a bellowing from dick the boy came hurriedly backing out of the hole he fetched an odor with him that nearly suffocated panhandle so strange and raw and terrible was it dick s eyes were shut for the time being he had been blinded he bounced around like a chicken with its head cut off bawling wildly what had happened panhandle did not know but it certainly suited him goody goody he shouted holding his nose and edging away from the lad then panhandle saw smoke issuing from the hole under the porch the mother skunk and her kittens scampered out into the weeds he heard the crackle of flames that boy had dropped his torch under the porch screaming panhandle ran to alarm his mother but it was too late there were no men near at hand so nothing could be done panhandle stood crying beside his mother watching their little home burn to the ground somehow in his mind the boy dick had been to blame panhandle peered round to find him but he was gone never would panhandle forget that boy they walked to the uncle s house and spent the night there soon another home was under construction on the same site it was more of a shack than a house for building materials were scarce and the near approach of winter made hasty construction imperative winter came soon and panhandle and his mother were alone it was cold and they huddled over the little wood fire they had plenty to eat but were very uncomfortable in the one room shack bill smith came home but seldom that fall the valley had been overrun with homesteaders nesters they were called and these newcomers passed by often from the town drunk and rough panhandle used to lie awake a good deal during these lonely hours the moan of the prairie wind the mourn of wolves and yelp of coyotes became part of his existence he understood why his mother barred and blocked the one door placed the ax by the bed and the gun under her pillow even then he longed for the time when he would be old and big enough to protect her the lonely winter with its innumerable hours of solitude for mrs smith and the boy had incalculable influence upon his character she taught him much ways and things words and feelings that became an integral part of his life at last the long winter ended with spring came the gales of wind which though no longer cold were terrible in their violence many a night panhandle lay awake shrinking beside his mother fearing the shack would blow away over their heads many a day the sun was obscured and nothing could be cooked no work done while the dust storm raged as spring advanced with a lessening of the tornadoes a new and fascinating game came into panhandle s life it was to sit at the one little window and watch the cowboys ride by how he came to worship them they were on their way to the spring roundups his father had told him all about them panhandle would strain his eyes to get a first glimpse of them to count the shaggy prancing horses the lithe supple riders with their great sombreros their bright scarfs guns and chaps and boots and spurs their lassos how they fascinated panhandle ropes to whirl and throw at a running steer that was a game he resolved to play when he grew up and his mother discovering his interest made him a little reata and taught him how to throw it how to make loops and knots she told him how her people had owned horses thrown lassos run cattle panhandle was always watching for the cowboys when they passed by he would run to the other side of the shack where there was a knothole stuffed with a rag and through this he would peep until he was blinded by dust these were full days for the lad rousing in him wonder and awe eagerness and fear strange longings for he knew not what then one day his father brought home a black pony with three white feet and a white spot on his face panhandle was in rapture for him he could have burst for very joy but he could not speak it developed that his mother would not let him ride the pony except when she led it this roused as great a grief as possession was joy a beautiful little pony he could not ride ideas formed in his mind scintillated and grew into dark purpose one day he stole curly and led him out of sight behind the barn and mounting him rode down to the spring panhandle found himself alone he was free he was on the back of a horse mighty and incalculable fact curly felt the spirit of that occasion after drinking at the spring he broke into a lope panhandle stuck on somehow and turned the pony toward the house curly loped faster panhandle felt the wind in his hair he bounced up and down squealing with delight he twisted his hands in the flowing mane and held on at the top of the hill his joy became divided by fear curly kept on loping down the hill toward the house faster and faster panhandle bounced higher and higher up on his neck back on his haunches until suddenly his hold broke and he was thrown down

his patient acutely with his ears but you see how important it is said sir richmond and left his sentence unfinished i ll do what i can for you said the doctor and considered swiftly what line of talk he had best follow section this sense of a coming smash is epidemic said the doctor it s at the back of all sorts of mental trouble it is a new state of mind before the war it was abnormal a phase of neurasthenia now it is almost the normal state with whole classes of intelligent people intelligent i say the others always have been casual and adventurous and always will be a loss of confidence in the general background of life so that we seem to float over abysses we do said sir richmond and we have nothing but the old habits and ideas acquired in the days of our assurance there is a discord a jarring the doctor pursued his train of thought a new raw and dreadful sense of responsibility for the universe accompanied by a realization that the job is overwhelmingly too big for us we ve got to stand up to the job said sir richmond anyhow what else is there to do we may keep things together i ve got to do my bit and if only i could hold myself at it i could beat those fellows but that s where the devil of it comes in never have i been so desirous to work well in my life and never have i been so slack and weak willed and inaccurate sloppy indolent vicious the doctor was about to speak but sir richmond interrupted him what s got hold of me what s got hold of me i used to work well enough it s as if my will had come untwisted and was ravelling out into separate strands i ve lost my unity i m not a man but a mob i ve got to recover my vigour at any cost again as the doctor was about to speak the word was taken out of his mouth and what i think of it dr martineau is this it s fatigue it s mental and moral fatigue too much effort on too high a level and too austere one strains and fags flags flags i meant to say one strains and flags and then the lower stuff in one the subconscious stuff takes control there was a flavour of popularized psychoanalysis about this and the doctor drew in the corners of his mouth and gave his head a critical slant m m but this only made sir richmond raise his voice and quicken his speech i want he said a good tonic a pick me up a stimulating harmless drug of some sort that s indicated anyhow to begin with something to pull me together as people say bring me up to the scratch again i don t like the use of drugs said the doctor the expectation of sir richmond s expression changed to disappointment but that s not reasonable he cried that s not reasonable that s superstition call a thing a drug and condemn it everything is a drug everything that affects you food stimulates or tranquillizes drink noise is a stimulant and quiet an opiate what is life but response to stimulants or reaction after them when i m exhausted i want food when i m overactive and sleepless i want tranquillizing when i m dispersed i want pulling together but we don t know how to use drugs the doctor objected but you ought to know dr martineau fixed his eye on a first floor window sill on the opposite side of harley street his manner suggested a lecturer holding on to his theme a day will come when we shall be able to manipulate drugs all sorts of drugs and work them in to our general way of living i have no prejudice against them at all a time will come when we shall correct our moods get down to our reserves of energy by their help suspend fatigue put off sleep during long spells of exertion at some sudden crisis for example when we shall know enough to know just how far to go with this that or the other stuff and how to wash out its after effects i quite agree with you in principle but that time hasn t come yet decades of research yet if we tried that sort of thing now we should be like children playing with poisons and explosives it s out of the question i ve been taking a few little things already easton syrup for example strychnine it carries you for a time and drops you by the way has it done you any good any nett good it has i can see broken your sleep the doctor turned round again to his patient and looked up into his troubled face given physiological trouble i don t mind resorting to a drug given structural injury i don t mind surgery but except for any little mischief your amateur drugging may have done you do not seem to me to be either sick or injured you ve no trouble either of structure or material you are worried ill in your mind and otherwise perfectly sound it s the current of your thoughts fermenting if the trouble is in the mental sphere why go out of the mental sphere for a treatment talk and thought these are your remedies cool deliberate thought you re unravelled you say it yourself drugs will only make this or that unravelled strand behave disproportionately you don t want that you want to take stock of yourself as a whole find out where you stand but the fuel

desolation which i shall never forget are for the most part unutterably bad of course we cried out that shakespeare wrote books and milton and shelley oh yes she interrupted us you ve been well taught i can see but you are not members of the london library here her sobs broke forth anew at length recovering a little she opened one of the pile of books which she always carried about with her from a window or in a garden or some such name as that it was called and it was written by a man called benton or henson or something of that kind she read the first few pages we listened in silence but that s not a book someone said so she chose another this time it was a history but i have forgotten the writer s name our trepidation increased as she went on not a word of it seemed to be true and the style in which it was written was execrable poetry poetry we cried impatiently read us poetry i cannot describe the desolation which fell upon us as she opened a little volume and mouthed out the verbose sentimental foolery which it contained it must have been written by a woman one of us urged but no she told us that it was written by a young man one of the most famous poets of the day i leave you to imagine what the shock of the discovery was though we all cried and begged her to read no more she persisted and read us extracts from the lives of the lord chancellors when she had finished jane the eldest and wisest of us rose to her feet and said that she for one was not convinced why she asked if men write such rubbish as this should our mothers have wasted their youth in bringing them into the world we were all silent and in the silence poor poll could be heard sobbing out why why did my father teach me to read clorinda was the first to come to her senses it s all our fault she said every one of us knows how to read but no one save poll has ever taken the trouble to do it i for one have taken it for granted that it was a woman s duty to spend her youth in bearing children i venerated my mother for bearing ten still more my grandmother for bearing fifteen it was i confess my own ambition to bear twenty we have gone on all these ages supposing that men were equally industrious and that their works were of equal merit while we have borne the children they we supposed have borne the books and the pictures we have populated the world they have civilized it but now that we can read what prevents us from judging the results before we bring another child into the world we must swear that we will find out what the world is like so we made ourselves into a society for asking questions one of us was to visit a man of war another was to hide herself in a scholar s study another was to attend a meeting of business men while all were to read books look at pictures go to concerts keep our eyes open in the streets and ask questions perpetually we were very young you can judge of our simplicity when i tell you that before parting that night we agreed that the objects of life were to produce good people and good books our questions were to be directed to finding out how far these objects were now attained by men we vowed solemnly that we would not bear a single child until we were satisfied off we went then some to the british museum others to the king s navy some to oxford others to cambridge we visited the royal academy and the tate heard modern music in concert rooms went to the law courts and saw new plays no one dined out without asking her partner certain questions and carefully noting his replies at intervals we met together and compared our observations oh those were merry meetings never have i laughed so much as i did when rose read her notes upon honour and described how she had dressed herself as an x thiopian prince and gone aboard one of his majesty s ships discovering the hoax the captain visited her now disguised as a private gentleman and demanded that honour should be satisfied but how she asked how he bellowed with the cane of course seeing that he was beside himself with rage and expecting that her last moment had come she bent over and received to her amazement six light taps upon the behind the honour of the british navy is avenged he cried and raising herself she saw him with the sweat pouring down his face holding out a trembling right hand away she exclaimed striking an attitude and imitating the ferocity of his own expression my honour has still to be satisfied spoken like a gentleman he returned and fell into profound thought if six strokes avenge the honour of the king s navy he mused how many avenge the honour of a private gentleman he said he would prefer to lay the case before his brother officers she replied haughtily that she could not wait he praised her sensibility let me see he

was seven years old large for his age a bold handsome lad with red hair mrs smith made a bargain with dick and led him back with her here panhandle took violent exception to having his pets killed or routed out by this boy he had never before seen he did not like his looks anyway but dick paid little heed to panhandle except once when mrs smith went into the house and then he knocked panhandle down for once panhandle did not squall he got up round eyed pale with his hands clenched he never said a word something was born in the depths of his gentle soul then dick tore a hole in the little wall of rocks that supported the porch and with a lighted torch on a stick he wormed his way in to rout out the skunks panhandle suddenly was thrilled and frightened by a bellowing from dick the boy came hurriedly backing out of the hole he fetched an odor with him that nearly suffocated panhandle so strange and raw and terrible was it dick s eyes were shut for the time being he had been blinded he bounced around like a chicken with its head cut off bawling wildly what had happened panhandle did not know but it certainly suited him goody goody he shouted holding his nose and edging away from the lad then panhandle saw smoke issuing from the hole under the porch the mother skunk and her kittens scampered out into the weeds he heard the crackle of flames that boy had dropped his torch under the porch screaming panhandle ran to alarm his mother but it was too late there were no men near at hand so nothing could be done panhandle stood crying beside his mother watching their little home burn to the ground somehow in his mind the boy dick had been to blame panhandle peered round to find him but he was gone never would panhandle forget that boy they walked to the uncle s house and spent the night there soon another home was under construction on the same site it was more of a shack than a house for building materials were scarce and the near approach of winter made hasty construction imperative winter came soon and panhandle and his mother were alone it was cold and they huddled over the little wood fire they had plenty to eat but were very uncomfortable in the one room shack bill smith came home but seldom that fall the valley had been overrun with homesteaders nesters they were called and these newcomers passed by often from the town drunk and rough panhandle used to lie awake a good deal during these lonely hours the moan of the prairie wind the mourn of wolves and yelp of coyotes became part of his existence he understood why his mother barred and blocked the one door placed the ax by the bed and the gun under her pillow even then he longed for the time when he would be old and big enough to protect her the lonely winter with its innumerable hours of solitude for mrs smith and the boy had incalculable influence upon his character she taught him much ways and things words and feelings that became an integral part of his life at last the long winter ended with spring came the gales of wind which though no longer cold were terrible in their violence many a night panhandle lay awake shrinking beside his mother fearing the shack would blow away over their heads many a day the sun was obscured and nothing could be cooked no work done while the dust storm raged as spring advanced with a lessening of the tornadoes a new and fascinating game came into panhandle s life it was to sit at the one little window and watch the cowboys ride by how he came to worship them they were on their way to the spring roundups his father had told him all about them panhandle would strain his eyes to get a first glimpse of them to count the shaggy prancing horses the lithe supple riders with their great sombreros their bright scarfs guns and chaps and boots and spurs their lassos how they fascinated panhandle ropes to whirl and throw at a running steer that was a game he resolved to play when he grew up and his mother discovering his interest made him a little reata and taught him how to throw it how to make loops and knots she told him how her people had owned horses thrown lassos run cattle panhandle was always watching for the cowboys when they passed by he would run to the other side of the shack where there was a knothole stuffed with a rag and through this he would peep until he was blinded by dust these were full days for the lad rousing in him wonder and awe eagerness and fear strange longings for he knew not what then one day his father brought home a black pony with three white feet and a white spot on his face panhandle was in rapture for him he could have burst for very joy but he could not speak it developed that his mother would not let him ride the pony except when she led it this roused as great a grief as possession was joy a beautiful little pony he could not ride ideas formed in his mind scintillated and grew into dark purpose one day he stole curly and led him out of sight behind the barn and mounting him rode down to the spring panhandle found himself alone he was free he was on the back of a horse mighty and incalculable fact curly felt the spirit of that occasion after drinking at the spring he broke into a lope panhandle stuck on somehow and turned the pony toward the house curly loped faster panhandle felt the wind in his hair he bounced up and down squealing with delight he twisted his hands in the flowing mane and held on at the top of the hill his joy became divided by fear curly kept on loping down the hill toward the house faster and faster panhandle bounced higher and higher up on his neck back on his haunches until suddenly his hold broke and he was thrown down

too having received a good many knocks at home he kept the hard head out of sight and played at poetry and romance with his literary wife and his sturdy passionate girls he was a man of courage not given to complaining bearing his burdens by himself no he did not let the world intrude far into his home he had a delicate sensitive wife whose poetry won some fame in the narrow world of letters he himself with his tough old barbarian fighting spirit had an almost child like delight in verse in sweet poetry and in the delightful game of a cultured home his blood was strong even to coarseness but that only made the home more vigorous more robust and christmassy there was always a touch of christmas about him now he was well off if there was poetry after dinner there were also chocolates and nuts and good little out of the way things to be munching well then into this family came egbert he was made of quite a different paste the girls and the father were strong limbed thick blooded people true english as holly trees and hawthorn are english their culture was grafted on to them as one might perhaps graft a common pink rose on to a thornstem it flowered oddly enough but it did not alter their blood and egbert was a born rose the age long breeding had left him with a delightful spontaneous passion he was not clever nor even literary no but the intonation of his voice and the movement of his supple handsome body and the fine texture of his flesh and his hair the slight arch of his nose the quickness of his blue eyes would easily take the place of poetry winifred loved him loved him this southerner as a higher being a higher being mind you not a deeper and as for him he loved her in passion with every fibre of him she was the very warm stuff of life to him wonderful then those days at crockham cottage the first days all alone save for the woman who came to work in the mornings marvellous days when she had all his tall supple fine fleshed youth to herself for herself and he had her like a ruddy fire into which he could cast himself for rejuvenation ah that it might never end this passion this marriage the flame of their two bodies burnt again into that old cottage that was haunted already by so much by gone physical desire you could not be in the dark room for an hour without the influences coming over you the hot blood desire of by gone yeomen there in this old den where they had lusted and bred for so many generations the silent house dark with thick timbered walls and the big black chimney place and the sense of secrecy dark with low little windows sunk into the earth dark like a lair where strong beasts had lurked and mated lonely at night and lonely by day left to themselves and their own intensity for so many generations it seemed to cast a spell on the two young people they became different there was a curious secret glow about them a certain slumbering flame hard to understand that enveloped them both they too felt that they did not belong to the london world any more crockham had changed their blood the sense of the snakes that lived and slept even in their own garden in the sun so that he going forward with the spade would see a curious coiled brownish pile on the black soil which suddenly would start up hiss and dazzle rapidly away hissing one day winifred heard the strangest scream from the flower bed under the low window of the living room ah the strangest scream like the very soul of the dark past crying aloud she ran out and saw a long brown snake on the flower bed and in its flat mouth the one hind leg of a frog was striving to escape and screaming its strange tiny bellowing scream she looked at the snake and from its sullen flat head it looked at her obstinately she gave a cry and it released the frog and slid angrily away that was crockham the spear of modern invention had not passed through it and it lay there secret primitive savage as when the saxons first came and egbert and she were caught there caught out of the world he was not idle nor was she there were plenty of things to be done the house to be put into final repair after the workmen had gone cushions and curtains to sew the paths to make the water to fetch and attend to and then the slope of the deep soiled neglected garden to level to terrace with little terraces and paths and to fill with flowers he worked away in his shirt sleeves worked all day intermittently doing this thing and the other and she quiet and rich in herself seeing him stooping and labouring away by himself would come to help him to be near him he of course was an amateur a born amateur he worked so hard and did so little and nothing he ever did would hold together for long if he terraced the garden he held up the earth with a couple of long narrow planks that soon began to bend with the pressure from behind and would not need many years to rot through and break and let the soil slither all down again in a heap towards the stream bed but there you are he had not been brought up to come to grips with anything and he thought it would do nay he did not think there was anything else except little temporary contrivances possible he who had such a passion for his old enduring cottage and for the old enduring things of the bygone england curious that the sense of permanency in the past had such a hold over him whilst in the present he was all amateurish and sketchy winifred could not criticize him town bred everything seemed to her splendid and the very digging and shovelling itself seemed romantic but neither egbert nor she yet realized the difference between work and romance godfrey marshall her father was at first perfect

italian primitives its chinese sculptures its unobtrusive dateless furniture there was the panelled drawing room where the huge chintz covered arm chairs stood oases of comfort among the austere flesh mortifying antiques there was the morning room with its pale lemon walls its painted venetian chairs and rococo tables its mirrors its modern pictures there was the library cool spacious and dark book lined from floor to ceiling rich in portentous folios there was the dining room solidly portwinily english with its great mahogany table its eighteenth century chairs and sideboard its eighteenth century pictures family portraits meticulous animal paintings what could one reconstruct from such data there was much of henry wimbush in the long gallery and the library something of anne perhaps in the morning room that was all among the accumulations of ten generations the living had left but few traces lying on the table in the morning room he saw his own book of poems what tact he picked it up and opened it it was what the reviewers call a slim volume he read at hazard but silence and the topless dark vault in the lights of luna park and blackpool from the nightly gloom hollows a bright tumultuous tomb he put it down again shook his head and sighed what genius i had then he reflected echoing the aged swift it was nearly six months since the book had been published he was glad to think he would never write anything of the same sort again who could have been reading it he wondered anne perhaps he liked to think so perhaps too she had at last recognised herself in the hamadryad of the poplar sapling the slim hamadryad whose movements were like the swaying of a young tree in the wind the woman who was a tree was what he had called the poem he had given her the book when it came out hoping that the poem would tell her what he hadn t dared to say she had never referred to it he shut his eyes and saw a vision of her in a red velvet cloak swaying into the little restaurant where they sometimes dined together in london three quarters of an hour late and he at his table haggard with anxiety irritation hunger oh she was damnable it occurred to him that perhaps his hostess might be in her boudoir it was a possibility he would go and see mrs wimbush s boudoir was in the central tower on the garden front a little staircase cork screwed up to it from the hall denis mounted

laughter were deep and masculine everything about her was manly she had a large square middle aged face with a massive projecting nose and little greenish eyes the whole surmounted by a lofty and elaborate coiffure of a curiously improbable shade of orange looking at her denis always thought of wilkie bard as the cantatrice that s why i m going to sing in op ra sing in op ra sing in op pop pop

ready in his mind it would be a pleasure to give it utterance to begin with he said but he was too late mrs wimbush s question had been what the grammarians call rhetorical it asked for no answer it was a little conversational flourish a gambit in the polite game you find me busy at my horoscopes she said without even being aware that she had interrupted him a little pained denis decided to reserve his story for more receptive ears he contented himself by way of revenge with saying oh rather icily did i tell you how i won four hundred on the grand national this year yes he replied still frigid and mono syllabic she must have told him at least six times wonderful isn t it everything is in the stars in the old days before i had the stars to help me i used to lose thousands now she

any one who is interested knows all about his coming by this time but his name sarah demanded why don t you tell us his name and all about him i love american millionaires who do things in wall street and fight with billions if he s really nice he may take me off your hands jimmy i d like to see him try that young man growled with unexpected fierceness well his name is john philip wingate kendrick told them he started life i believe as a journalist then he inherited a fortune and made another one on wall street where i imagine he came across dreadnought phipps what happened i don t exactly know he went on ruminatively phipps couldn t have squeezed him or we should have heard about it but somehow or other the two got at loggerheads for it s common knowledge amongst their business connections i don t know that they have any friends that wingate has sworn to break phipps there will be quite a commotion in the city when it gets about that wingate is here or on his way over it s almost like a

seem in the least terrifying is mr wingate like that or is he a dourer type john wingate kendrick said reflectively is a much younger man than phipps i should say that he wasn t more than thirty five and much better looking i must say that in a struggle i shouldn t know which to back wingate has sentiment and phipps has none conscience of which phipps hasn t a shred and a sense of honour with which phipps was certainly never troubled these points are all against him in a market duel but on the other hand he has a bigger outlook than phipps he has nerves of steel and the grit of a hero did i tell you by the by that he went into the war as a private and came out a brigadier splendid sarah murmured now tell us where peter phipps comes in well kendrick continued phipps attracts sympathy because of his lavish hospitality and apparent generosity whilst wingate is a man of many reserves and has few friends either on this side or the other then phipps i should say is the wealthier man and in this present deal at any rate he has marvellous support so that financially he must tower over wingate then too i think he understands the tricks of the market better over here and he has a very dangerous confederate in skinflint martin what that old blackguard doesn t know of chicanery and crooked dealing the devil himself couldn t make use of if he s put his own money into b i i should say that phipps can t be broken my advice to wingate at any rate when we meet will be to stand by for a time the sound of approaching voices warned them that their seclusion was on the point of being

there was a brief silence during which nigel knowing his uncle s humours leaned back in his chair and waited upon the table was a little pile of closely written manuscript and by their side several black bound code books upon which the f o private still remained though almost obliterated with time lord dorminster s occupation was apparent he was decoding a message of unusual length presently he turned away from the table however and faced his nephew his hands travelled to his waistcoat pocket he drew out a cigarette from a thin gold case lit it and began to smoke then he crossed his legs and leaned a little farther back in his chair nigel he said we are living in strange times no one denies that sir was the grave assent lord dorminster glanced at the calendar which stood upon the desk to day he continued is the twenty third day of march nineteen hundred and thirty four fifteen years ago that terrible peace treaty was signed since then you know what the history of our country has been i am not blowing my own trumpet when i say that nearly every man with true political insight has been cast adrift at the present moment the country is in the hands of a body of highly respectable and well meaning men who as a parish council might conduct the affairs of dorminster town with unqualified success as statesmen they do not exist it seems to me nigel that you and i are going to see in reality that spectre which terrified the world twenty years ago we are going to see the breaking up of a mighty empire tell me what has happened or is going to happen nigel begged well for one thing his uncle replied the emperor of the east is preparing for a visit to europe he will be here probably next month you know whom i mean of course prince shan nigel exclaimed prince shan of china lord dorminster assented his coming links up many things which had been puzzling me i tell you nigel what happens during prince shan s visit will probably decide the destinies of this country and yet i wouldn t mind betting you a thousand to one that there isn t a single official of the government who has the slightest idea as to why he is coming or that he is coming at all do you know nigel asked i can only surmise let us leave prince shan for the moment nigel now listen you go about a great deal what do people say about me honestly i mean speak with your face to the light they call you a faddist and a scaremonger nigel confessed yet there are one or two especially at the st philip s club diplomatists and ambassadors whose place in the world has passed away who think and believe differently you know sir that i am amongst them lord dorminster nodded kindly well he said i fancy i am about to prove myself seven years ago it was he went on reminiscently when the new national party came into supreme power you know one of their first battle cries down with all secret treaties down with all secret diplomacy let nothing exist but an honest commercial understanding between the different countries of the world how germany and russia howled with joy in place of an english statesman with his country s broad interests at heart we have in berlin and petrograd half a dozen representatives of the great industries whose object in their own words is i believe to develop friendly commercialism and a feeling of brotherhood between the nations not only our ambassadors but our secret service were swept clean out of existence i remember going to broadley the day he was appointed foreign minister and i asked him a simple question i asked him whether he did not consider it his duty to keep his finger upon the pulses of the other great nations however friendly they might seem to keep himself assured that all these expressions of good will were honourable and that in the heart of the german nation that great craving for revenge which is the natural heritage of the present generation had really become dissipated broadley smiled at me lord dorminster he said the chief

as anselme put forth hands to do his bidding a mirror from my closet dispatch the secretary was gone in a flash and in a flash returned even as anselme completed his master s toilet but clearly monsieur de tressan had awakened in a peevish humour for no sooner were the buttons of his doublet secured than with his own fingers he tore them loose again cursing his majordomo the while with vigour you dog anselme have you no sense of fitness no discrimination am i to appear in this garment of the mode of a half century ago before madame la marquise take it off take it off man get me the coat that came last month from paris the yellow one with the hanging sleeves and the gold buttons and a sash the crimson sash i had from taillemant can you move no quicker animal are you still here anselme thus enjoined lent an unwonted alacrity to his movements waddling grotesquely like a hastening waterfowl between him and the secretary they dressed my lord the seneschal and decked him out till he was fit to compare with a bird of paradise for gorgeousness of colouring if not for harmony of hues and elegance of outline babylas held the mirror and anselme adjusted the seneschal s wig whilst tressan himself twisted his black mustachios how they kept their colour was a mystery to his acquaintance and combed the tuft of beard that sprouted from one of his several chins he took a last look at his reflection rehearsed a smile and bade anselme introduce his visitor he desired his secretary to go to the devil but thinking better of it he recalled him as he reached the door his cherished vanity craved expression wait said he there is a letter must be written the king s business may not suffer postponement not for all the dowagers in france sit down babylas obeyed him tressan stood with his back to the open door his ears strained to listen had caught the swish of a woman s gown he cleared his throat and began to dictate to her majesty the queen regent he paused and stood with knitted brows deep in thought then he ponderously repeated to her majesty the queen regent have you got that yes monsieur le comte to her majesty the queen regent there was a step and a throat clearing cough behind him monsieur de tressan said a woman s voice a rich melodious voice if haughty and arrogant of intonation on the instant he turned advanced a step and bowed your humblest servant madame said he his hand upon his heart this is an honour which which necessity thrusts upon you she broke in imperiously dismiss that fellow the secretary pale and shy had risen his eyes dilated at the woman s speech he looked for a catastrophe as the natural result of her taking such a tone with this man who was the terror of his household and of all grenoble instead the lord seneschal s meekness left him breathless with surprise he is my secretary madame we were at work as you came i was on the point of inditing a letter to her majesty the office of seneschal in a province such as dauphiny is helas no sinecure he sighed like one whose brain is weary it leaves a man little time even to eat or sleep you will be needing a holiday then said she with cool insolence take one for once and let the king s business give place for half an hour to mine the secretary s horror grew by leaps and bounds surely the storm would burst at last about this audacious woman s head but the lord seneschal usually so fiery and tempestuous did no more than make her another of his absurd bows you anticipate madame the very words i was about to utter babylas vanish and he waved the scribbler doorwards with a contemptuous hand take your papers with you into my closet there we will resume that letter to her majesty when madame shall have left me the secretary gathered up his papers his quills and his inkhorn and went his way accounting the end of the world at hand when the door had closed upon him the seneschal with another bow and a simper placed a chair at his visitor s disposal she looked at the chair then looked at the man much as she had looked at the chair and turning her back contemptuously on both she sauntered towards the fireplace she stood before the blaze with her whip tucked under her arm drawing off her stout riding gloves she was a tall splendidly proportioned woman of a superb beauty of countenance for all that she was well past the spring of life in the waning light of that october afternoon none would have guessed her age to be so much as thirty though in the sunlight you might have set it at a little more but in no light at all would you have guessed the truth that her next would be her forty second birthday her face was pale of an ivory pallor that gleamed in sharp contrast with the ebony of her lustrous hair under the long lashes of low lids a pair of eyes black and insolent set off the haughty lines of her scarlet lips her nose was thin and straight her neck an ivory pillar splendidly upright upon her handsome shoulders she was dressed for riding in a gown of sapphire velvet handsomely laced in gold across the stomacher and surmounted at the neck where it was cut low and square by the starched band of fine linen which in france was already replacing the more elaborate ruff on her head over a linen coif she wore a tall crowned grey beaver swathed with a scarf of blue and gold standing by the hearth one foot on the stone kerb one elbow leaning lightly on the overmantel she proceeded leisurely to remove her gloves the seneschal observed her with eyes that held an odd mixture of furtiveness and admiration his

with his father and grandfather that charles the second was not content with saying witty things about his philosophers but did wise things with regard to them for he not only bestowed upon them such attention as he could spare from his poodles and his mistresses but being in his usual state of impecuniosity begged for them of the duke of ormond and that step being without effect gave them chelsea college a charter and a mace crowning his favours in the best way they could be crowned by burdening them no further with royal patronage or state interference thus it was that the half dozen young men studious of the new philosophy who met in one another s lodgings in oxford or in london in the middle of the seventeenth century grew in numerical and in real strength until in the latter part the royal society for the improvement of natural knowledge had already become famous and had acquired a claim upon the veneration of englishmen which it has ever since retained as the principal focus of scientific activity in our islands and the chief champion of the cause it was formed to support it was by the aid of the royal society that newton published his principia if all the books in the world except the philosophical transactions were destroyed it is safe to say that the foundations of physical science would remain unshaken and that the vast intellectual progress of the last two centuries would be largely though incompletely recorded nor have any signs of halting or of decrepitude manifested themselves in our own times as in dr wallis s days so in these our business is precluding theology and state affairs to discourse and consider of philosophical enquiries but our mathematick is one which newton would have to go to school to learn our staticks mechanicks magneticks chymicks and natural experiments constitute a mass of physical and chemical knowledge a glimpse at which would compensate galileo for the doings of a score of inquisitorial cardinals our physick and anatomy have embraced such infinite varieties of being have laid open such new worlds in time and space have grappled not unsuccessfully with such complex problems that the eyes of vesalius and of harvey might be dazzled by the sight of the tree that has grown out of their grain of mustard seed the fact is perhaps rather too much than too little forced upon one s notice nowadays that all this marvellous intellectual growth has a no less wonderful expression in practical life and that in this respect if in no other the movement symbolized by the progress of the royal society stands without a parallel in the history of mankind a series of volumes as bulky as the transactions of the royal society might possibly be filled with the subtle speculations of the schoolmen not improbably the obtaining a mastery over the products of mediaeval thought might necessitate an even greater expenditure of time and of energy than the acquirement of the new philosophy but though such work engrossed the best intellects of europe for a longer time than has elapsed since the great fire its effects were writ in water so far as our social state is concerned on the other hand if the noble first president of the royal society could revisit the upper air and once more gladden his eyes with a sight of the familiar mace he would find himself in the midst of a material civilization more different from that of his day than that of the seventeenth was from that of the first century and if lord brouncker s native sagacity had not deserted his ghost he would need no long reflection to discover that all these great ships these railways these telegraphs these factories these printing presses without which the whole fabric of modern english society would collapse into a mass of stagnant and starving pauperism that all these pillars of our state are but the ripples and the bubbles upon the surface of that great spiritual stream the springs of which only he and his fellows were privileged to see and seeing to recognise as that which it behoved them above all things to keep pure and undefiled it may not be too great a flight of imagination to conceive our noble revenant not forgetful of the great troubles of his own day and anxious to know how often london had been burned down since his time and how often the plague had carried off its thousands he would have to learn that although london contains tenfold the inflammable matter that it did in though not content with filling our rooms with woodwork and light draperies we must needs lead inflammable and explosive gases into every corner of our streets and houses we never allow even a street to burn down and if he asked how this had come about we should have to explain that the improvement of natural knowledge has furnished us with dozens of machines for throwing water upon fires any one of which would have furnished the ingenious mr hooke the first curator and experimenter of the royal society with ample materials for discourse before half a dozen meetings of that body and that to say truth except for the progress of natural knowledge we should not have been able to make even the tools by which these machines are constructed and further it would be necessary to add that although severe fires sometimes occur and inflict great damage the loss is very generally compensated by societies the operations of which have been rendered possible only by the progress of natural knowledge in the direction of mathematics and the accumulation of wealth in virtue of other natural knowledge but the plague my lord brouncker s observation would not i fear lead him to think that englishmen of the nineteenth century are purer in life or more fervent in religious faith than the generation which could produce a

genuine godliness which made him next to alfred the great the first monarch who ever sat on the english throne two years after dryden came to london cromwell expired and the poet wrote and published his heroic stanzas on the hero s death which we consider really his earliest poem when richard resigned dryden in common with the majority of the nation saw that the roundhead cause was lost and hastened to carry over his talents to the gaining side for this we do not blame him very severely although it certainly had been nobler if like milton he had clung to his party sir walter scott remarks that dryden never retracted the praise he gave to cromwell in absalom and achitophel he sneers at richard as ishbosheth but says nothing against the deceased giant saul it is clear too that at first his desertion of the cromwell party was a loss to the poet he lost the chance of their favour in case a reaction should come his situation as secretary and the shelter of pickering s princely mansion as might have been expected his ancient friends were indignant at the change and not less so at the alteration he thought proper at the same time to make in the spelling of his name from driden to dryden he went to reside in the obscure house of one herringman a bookseller in the new exchange and became for life a professional author his enemies afterwards reproached him bitterly for his mean circumstances at this period of his life and asserted that he was a mere drudge to herringman he at all events did little in his own proper poetic calling for two years a poem on the coronation of charles well fitted to wipe away the stain of cromwellism and to attract upon the poet the eye of that rising sun whose glory he sang with more zeal than truth a panegyric on the lord chancellor and a satire on the dutch were all and are all short and all savour of a vein somewhat hide bound he planned indeed too and partly wrote one or more plays and was considered of consequence enough to be elected a member of the royal society in previous to this he had been introduced through herringman to sir robert howard son of the first earl of berkshire and a relation of edward howard the author of british princes and the object of the witty wrath of butler sir robert too had a poetical propensity and dryden and he became and continued intimate for a number of years the poet assisting the knight in his literary compositions particularly in a play entitled the indian queen and the latter inviting the former to the family seat at charlton where dryden met in an unlucky hour his future wife lady elizabeth howard the sister of sir robert it was on the st of december in st swithin s london and with the consent of the earl who settled about a year on his daughter that this unhappy union took place the lady seems to have had absolutely none of the qualities which tend either to command a husband s respect or to conciliate his regard but is described as a woman of violent temper and weak understanding much of the bitterness of dryden s satire some of the coarse licentiousness of his plays and all the sarcasms at matrimony which he has scattered in multitudes throughout his works may be traced to his domestic unhappiness otherwise the match had some advantages it broke up for a time at least some licentious connexions he had formed particularly after a time one with mrs reeves the actress with whom having laid aside his norwich drugget he used to eat tarts at the mulberry gardens with a sword and a chadreux wig it secured to him including his own property an income of about a year a sum equal to now and which on the death of his mother three years later was increased by more or at the present value of money he was thus protected for life against the meaner and more miserable necessities of the literary man under which many of his unfortunate rivals were crushed and if he could not always command luxuries he was always sure of bread to improve his circumstances however and to enable him to keep up a style of living in unison with his lady s rank he must write and the question arose what mode of composition was likely to be the most lucrative were he to continue to indite panegyrical verses like those to clarendon he stood a chance of having a few guineas tossed to him now and then by a patron like a crust to an unfortunate cur were he to translate or write prefaces for the booksellers he might pay his bill for salt if diligent enough for satires as yet there was little demand the follies of the more fanatical of the puritans were too recent although they were beginning to ripen for the hand of butler and the far grosser absurdities of the cavaliers were yet in blossom there remained nothing for an aspiring author but the stage which during the previous regime had been abolished while the french revolution was in progress ay even in the depths of the reign of terror the theatres were all open and all crowded but when cromwell was enacting his solemn and solitary part before god angels and men the petty potentates the gods and goddesses of the stage vanished into thin air at his tremendous stamp their cue had been exeunt omnes and if the spirit of shakspeare himself had witnessed the departure he would have added his amen and had he watched in their stead the gigantic actor treading his trembling stage alone with all the world looking on he might have remembered and re applied his own magnificent words o for a muse of fire that would ascend the brightest heaven of invention a kingdom for a stage princes

genuine godliness which made him next to alfred the great the first monarch who ever sat on the english throne two years after dryden came to london cromwell expired and the poet wrote and published his heroic stanzas on the hero s death which we consider really his earliest poem when richard resigned dryden in common with the majority of the nation saw that the roundhead cause was lost and hastened to carry over his talents to the gaining side for this we do not blame him very severely although it certainly had been nobler if like milton he had clung to his party sir walter scott remarks that dryden never retracted the praise he gave to cromwell in absalom and achitophel he sneers at richard as ishbosheth but says nothing against the deceased giant saul it is clear too that at first his desertion of the cromwell party was a loss to the poet he lost the chance of their favour in case a reaction should come his situation as secretary and the shelter of pickering s princely mansion as might have been expected his ancient friends were indignant at the change and not less so at the alteration he thought proper at the same time to make in the spelling of his name from driden to dryden he went to reside in the obscure house of one herringman a bookseller in the new exchange and became for life a professional author his enemies afterwards reproached him bitterly for his mean circumstances at this period of his life and asserted that he was a mere drudge to herringman he at all events did little in his own proper poetic calling for two years a poem on the coronation of charles well fitted to wipe away the stain of cromwellism and to attract upon the poet the eye of that rising sun whose glory he sang with more zeal than truth a panegyric on the lord chancellor and a satire on the dutch were all and are all short and all savour of a vein somewhat hide bound he planned indeed too and partly wrote one or more plays and was considered of consequence enough to be elected a member of the royal society in previous to this he had been introduced through herringman to sir robert howard son of the first earl of berkshire and a relation of edward howard the author of british princes and the object of the witty wrath of butler sir robert too had a poetical propensity and dryden and he became and continued intimate for a number of years the poet assisting the knight in his literary compositions particularly in a play entitled the indian queen and the latter inviting the former to the family seat at charlton where dryden met in an unlucky hour his future wife lady elizabeth howard the sister of sir robert it was on the st of december in st swithin s london and with the consent of the earl who settled about a year on his daughter that this unhappy union took place the lady seems to have had absolutely none of the qualities which tend either to command a husband s respect or to conciliate his regard but is described as a woman of violent temper and weak understanding much of the bitterness of dryden s satire some of the coarse licentiousness of his plays and all the sarcasms at matrimony which he has scattered in multitudes throughout his works may be traced to his domestic unhappiness otherwise the match had some advantages it broke up for a time at least some licentious connexions he had formed particularly after a time one with mrs reeves the actress with whom having laid aside his norwich drugget he used to eat tarts at the mulberry gardens with a sword and a chadreux wig it secured to him including his own property an income of about a year a sum equal to now and which on the death of his mother three years later was increased by more or at the present value of money he was thus protected for life against the meaner and more miserable necessities of the literary man under which many of his unfortunate rivals were crushed and if he could not always command luxuries he was always sure of bread to improve his circumstances however and to enable him to keep up a style of living in unison with his lady s rank he must write and the question arose what mode of composition was likely to be the most lucrative were he to continue to indite panegyrical verses like those to clarendon he stood a chance of having a few guineas tossed to him now and then by a patron like a crust to an unfortunate cur were he to translate or write prefaces for the booksellers he might pay his bill for salt if diligent enough for satires as yet there was little demand the follies of the more fanatical of the puritans were too recent although they were beginning to ripen for the hand of butler and the far grosser absurdities of the cavaliers were yet in blossom there remained nothing for an aspiring author but the stage which during the previous regime had been abolished while the french revolution was in progress ay even in the depths of the reign of terror the theatres were all open and all crowded but when cromwell was enacting his solemn and solitary part before god angels and men the petty potentates the gods and goddesses of the stage vanished into thin air at his tremendous stamp their cue had been exeunt omnes and if the spirit of shakspeare himself had witnessed the departure he would have added his amen and had he watched in their stead the gigantic actor treading his trembling stage alone

with his father and grandfather that charles the second was not content with saying witty things about his philosophers but did wise things with regard to them for he not only bestowed upon them such attention as he could spare from his poodles and his mistresses but being in his usual state of impecuniosity begged for them of the duke of ormond and that step being without effect gave them chelsea college a charter and a mace crowning his favours in the best way they could be crowned by burdening them no further with royal patronage or state interference thus it was that the half dozen young men studious of the new philosophy who met in one another s lodgings in oxford or in london in the middle of the seventeenth century grew in numerical and in real strength until in the latter part the royal society for the improvement of natural knowledge had already become famous and had acquired a claim upon the veneration of englishmen which it has ever since retained as the principal focus of scientific activity in our islands and the chief champion of the cause it was formed to support it was by the aid of the royal society that newton published his principia if all the books in the world except the philosophical transactions were destroyed it is safe to say that the foundations of physical science would remain unshaken and that the vast intellectual progress of the last two centuries would be largely though incompletely recorded nor have any signs of halting or of decrepitude manifested themselves in our own times as in dr wallis s days so in these our business is precluding theology and state affairs to discourse and consider of philosophical enquiries but our mathematick is one which newton would have to go to school to learn our staticks mechanicks magneticks chymicks and natural experiments constitute a mass of physical and chemical knowledge a glimpse at which would compensate galileo for the doings of a score of inquisitorial cardinals our physick and anatomy have embraced such infinite varieties of being have laid open such new worlds in time and space have grappled not unsuccessfully with such complex problems that the eyes of vesalius and of harvey might be dazzled by the sight of the tree that has grown out of their grain of mustard seed the fact is perhaps rather too much than too little forced upon one s notice nowadays that all this marvellous intellectual growth has a no less wonderful expression in practical life and that in this respect if in no other the movement symbolized by the progress of the royal society stands without a parallel in the history of mankind a series of volumes as bulky as the transactions of the royal society might possibly be filled with the subtle speculations of the schoolmen not improbably the obtaining a mastery over the products of mediaeval thought might necessitate an even greater expenditure of time and of energy than the acquirement of the new philosophy but though such work engrossed the best intellects of europe for a longer time than has elapsed since the great fire its effects were writ in water so far as our social state is concerned on the other hand if the noble first president of the royal society could revisit the upper air and once more gladden his eyes with a sight of the familiar mace he would find himself in the midst of a material civilization more different from that of his day than that of the seventeenth was from that of the first century and if lord brouncker s native sagacity had not deserted his ghost he would need no long reflection to discover that all these great ships these railways these telegraphs these factories these printing presses without which the whole fabric of modern english society would collapse into a mass of stagnant and starving pauperism that all these pillars of our state are but the ripples and the bubbles upon the surface of that great spiritual stream the springs of which only he and his fellows were privileged to see and seeing to recognise as that which it behoved them above all things to keep pure and undefiled it may not be too great a flight of imagination to conceive our noble revenant not forgetful of the great troubles of his own day and anxious to know how often london had been burned down since his time and how often the plague had carried off its thousands he would have to learn that although london contains tenfold the inflammable matter that it did in though not content with filling our rooms with woodwork and light draperies we must needs lead inflammable and explosive gases into every corner of our streets and houses we never allow even a street to burn down and if he asked how this had come about we should have to explain that the improvement of natural knowledge has furnished us with dozens of machines for throwing water upon fires any one of which would have furnished the ingenious mr hooke the first curator and experimenter of the royal society with ample materials for discourse before half a dozen meetings of that body and that to say truth except for the progress of natural knowledge we should not have been able to make even the tools by which these machines are constructed and further it would be necessary to add that although severe fires sometimes occur and inflict great damage the loss is very generally compensated by societies the operations of which have been rendered possible only by the progress of natural knowledge in the direction of mathematics and the accumulation of wealth in virtue of other natural knowledge but the plague my lord brouncker s observation would not i fear lead him to think that englishmen of the nineteenth century are purer in life or more fervent in religious faith than the generation which could produce a

hastened to carry over his talents to the gaining side for this we do not blame him very severely although it certainly had been nobler if like milton he had clung to his party sir walter scott remarks that dryden never retracted the praise he gave to cromwell in absalom and achitophel he sneers at richard as ishbosheth but says nothing against the deceased giant saul it is clear too that at first his desertion of the cromwell party was a loss to the poet he lost the chance of their favour in case a reaction should come his situation as secretary and the shelter of pickering s princely mansion as might have been expected his ancient friends were indignant at the change and not less so at the alteration he thought proper at the same time to make in the spelling of his name from driden to dryden he went to reside in the obscure house of one herringman a bookseller in the new exchange and became for life a professional author his enemies afterwards reproached him bitterly for his mean circumstances at this period of his life and asserted that he was a mere drudge to herringman he at all events did little in his own proper poetic calling for two years a poem on the coronation of charles well fitted to wipe away the stain of cromwellism and to attract upon the poet the eye of that rising sun whose glory he sang with more zeal than truth a panegyric on the lord chancellor and a satire on the dutch were all and are all short and all savour of a vein somewhat hide bound he planned indeed too and partly wrote one or more plays and was considered of consequence enough to be elected a member of the royal society in previous to this he had been introduced through herringman to sir robert howard son of the first earl of berkshire and a relation of edward howard the author of british princes and the object of the witty wrath of butler sir robert too had a poetical propensity and dryden and he became and continued intimate for a number of years the poet assisting the knight in his literary compositions particularly in a play entitled the indian queen and the latter inviting the former to the family seat at charlton where dryden met in an unlucky hour his future wife lady elizabeth howard the sister of sir robert it was on the st of december in st swithin s london and with the consent of the earl who settled about a year on his daughter that this unhappy union took place the lady seems to have had absolutely none of the qualities which tend either to command a husband s respect or to conciliate his regard but is described as a woman of violent temper and weak understanding much of the bitterness of dryden s satire some of the coarse licentiousness of his plays and all the sarcasms at matrimony which he has scattered in multitudes throughout his works may be traced to his domestic unhappiness otherwise the match had some advantages it broke up for a time at least some licentious connexions he had formed particularly after a time one with mrs reeves the actress with whom having laid aside his norwich drugget he used to eat tarts at the mulberry gardens with a sword and a chadreux wig it secured to him including his own property an income of about a year a sum equal to now and which on the death of his mother three years later was increased by more or at the present value of money he was thus protected for life against the meaner and more miserable necessities of the literary man under which many of his unfortunate rivals were crushed and if he could not always command luxuries he was always sure of bread to improve his circumstances however and to enable him to keep up a style of living in unison with his lady s rank he must write and the question arose what mode of composition was likely to be the most lucrative were he to continue to indite panegyrical verses like those to clarendon he stood a chance of having a few guineas tossed to him now and then by a patron like a crust to an unfortunate cur were he to translate or write prefaces for the booksellers he might pay his bill for salt if diligent enough for satires as yet there was little demand the follies of the more fanatical of the puritans were too recent although they were beginning to ripen for the hand of butler and the far grosser absurdities of the cavaliers were yet in blossom there remained nothing for an aspiring author but the stage which during the previous regime had been abolished while the french revolution was in progress ay even in the depths of the reign of terror the theatres were all open and all crowded but when cromwell was enacting his solemn and solitary part before god angels and men the petty potentates the gods and goddesses of the stage vanished into thin air at his tremendous stamp their cue had been exeunt omnes and if the spirit of shakspeare himself had witnessed the departure he would have added his amen and had he watched in their stead the gigantic actor treading his trembling stage alone with all the world looking on he might have remembered and re applied his own magnificent words o for a muse of fire that would ascend the brightest heaven of invention a kingdom for a stage princes

his heroic stanzas on the hero s death which we consider really his earliest poem when richard resigned dryden in common with the majority of the nation saw that the roundhead cause was lost and hastened to carry over his talents to the gaining side for this we do not blame him very severely although it certainly had been nobler if like milton he had clung to his party sir walter scott remarks that dryden never retracted the praise he gave to cromwell in absalom and achitophel he sneers at richard as ishbosheth but says nothing against the deceased giant saul it is clear too that at first his desertion of the cromwell party was a loss to the poet he lost the chance of their favour in case a reaction should come his situation as secretary and the shelter of pickering s princely mansion as might have been expected his ancient friends were indignant at the change and not less so at the alteration he thought proper at the same time to make in the spelling of his name from driden to dryden he went to reside in the obscure house of one herringman a bookseller in the new exchange and became for life a professional author his enemies afterwards reproached him bitterly for his mean circumstances at this period of his life and asserted that he was a mere drudge to herringman he at all events did little in his own proper poetic calling for two years a poem on the coronation of charles well fitted to wipe away the stain of cromwellism and to attract upon the poet the eye of that rising sun whose glory he sang with more zeal than truth a panegyric on the lord chancellor and a satire on the dutch were all and are all short and all savour of a vein somewhat hide bound he planned indeed too and partly wrote one or more plays and was considered of consequence enough to be elected a member of the royal society in previous to this he had been introduced through herringman to sir robert howard son of the first earl of berkshire and a relation of edward howard the author of british princes and the object of the witty wrath of butler sir robert too had a poetical propensity and dryden and he became and continued intimate for a number of years the poet assisting the knight in his literary compositions particularly in a play entitled the indian queen and the latter inviting the former to the family seat at charlton where dryden met in an unlucky hour his future wife lady elizabeth howard the sister of sir robert it was on the st of december in st swithin s london and with the consent of the earl who settled about a year on his daughter that this unhappy union took place the lady seems to have had absolutely none of the qualities which tend either to command a husband s respect or to conciliate his regard but is described as a woman of violent temper and weak understanding much of the bitterness of dryden s satire some of the coarse licentiousness of his plays and all the sarcasms at matrimony which he has scattered in multitudes throughout his works may be traced to his domestic unhappiness otherwise the match had some advantages it broke up for a time at least some licentious connexions he had formed particularly after a time one with mrs reeves the actress with whom having laid aside his norwich drugget he used to eat tarts at the mulberry gardens with a sword and a chadreux wig it secured to him including his own property an income of about a year a sum equal to now and which on the death of his mother three years later was increased by more or at the present value of money he was thus protected for life against the meaner and more miserable necessities of the literary man under which many of his unfortunate rivals were crushed and if he could not always command luxuries he was always sure of bread to improve his circumstances however and to enable him to keep up a style of living in unison with his lady s rank he must write and the question arose what mode of composition was likely to be the most lucrative were he to continue to indite panegyrical verses like those to clarendon he stood a chance of having a few guineas tossed to him now and then by a patron like a crust to an unfortunate cur were he to translate or write prefaces for the booksellers he might pay his bill for salt if diligent enough for satires as yet there was little demand the follies of the more fanatical of the puritans were too recent although they were beginning to ripen for the hand of butler and the far grosser absurdities of the cavaliers were yet in blossom there remained nothing for an aspiring author but the stage which during the previous regime had been abolished while the french revolution was in progress ay even in the depths of the reign of terror the theatres were all open and all crowded but when cromwell was enacting his solemn and solitary part before god angels and men the petty potentates the gods and goddesses of the stage vanished into thin air at his tremendous stamp their cue had been exeunt omnes and if the spirit of shakspeare himself had witnessed the departure he would have added his amen and had he watched in their stead the gigantic actor treading his trembling stage alone with all the world looking on he might have remembered and re applied his own magnificent words o for a muse of fire that would ascend the brightest heaven of invention a kingdom for a stage princes

with his father and grandfather that charles the second was not content with saying witty things about his philosophers but did wise things with regard to them for he not only bestowed upon them such attention as he could spare from his poodles and his mistresses but being in his usual state of impecuniosity begged for them of the duke of ormond and that step being without effect gave them chelsea college a charter and a mace crowning his favours in the best way they could be crowned by burdening them no further with royal patronage or state interference thus it was that the half dozen young men studious of the new philosophy who met in one another s lodgings in oxford or in london in the middle of the seventeenth century grew in numerical and in real strength until in the latter part the royal society for the improvement of natural knowledge had already become famous and had acquired a claim upon the veneration of englishmen which it has ever since retained as the principal focus of scientific activity in our islands and the chief champion of the cause it was formed to support it was by the aid of the royal society that newton published his principia if all the books in the world except the philosophical transactions were destroyed it is safe to say that the foundations of physical science would remain unshaken and that the vast intellectual progress of the last two centuries would be largely though incompletely recorded nor have any signs of halting or of decrepitude manifested themselves in our own times as in dr wallis s days so in these our business is precluding theology and state affairs to discourse and consider of philosophical enquiries but our mathematick is one which newton would have to go to school to learn our staticks mechanicks magneticks chymicks and natural experiments constitute a mass of physical and chemical knowledge a glimpse at which would compensate galileo for the doings of a score of inquisitorial cardinals our physick and anatomy have embraced such infinite varieties of being have laid open such new worlds in time and space have grappled not unsuccessfully with such complex problems that the eyes of vesalius and of harvey might be dazzled by the sight of the tree that has grown out of their grain of mustard seed the fact is perhaps rather too much than too little forced upon one s notice nowadays that all this marvellous intellectual growth has a no less wonderful expression in practical life and that in this respect if in no other the movement symbolized by the progress of the royal society stands without a parallel in the history of mankind a series of volumes as bulky as the transactions of the royal society might possibly be filled with the subtle speculations of the schoolmen not improbably the obtaining a mastery over the products of mediaeval thought might necessitate an even greater expenditure of time and of energy than the acquirement of the new philosophy but though such work engrossed the best intellects of europe for a longer time than has elapsed since the great fire its effects were writ in water so far as our social state is concerned on the other hand if the noble first president of the royal society could revisit the upper air and once more gladden his eyes with a sight of the familiar mace he would find himself in the midst of a material civilization more different from that of his day than that of the seventeenth was from that of the first century and if lord brouncker s native sagacity had not deserted his ghost he would need no long reflection to discover that all these great ships these railways these telegraphs these factories these printing presses without which the whole fabric of modern english society would collapse into a mass of stagnant and starving pauperism that all these pillars of our state are but the ripples and the bubbles upon the surface of that great spiritual stream the springs of which only he and his fellows were privileged to see and seeing to recognise as that which it behoved them above all things to keep pure and undefiled it may not be too great a flight of imagination to conceive our noble revenant not forgetful of the great troubles of his own day and anxious to know how often london had been burned down since his time and how often the plague had carried off its thousands he would have to learn that although london contains tenfold the inflammable matter that it did in though not content with filling our rooms with woodwork and light draperies we must needs lead inflammable and explosive gases into every corner of our streets and houses we never allow even a street to burn down and if he asked how this had come about we should have to explain that the improvement of natural knowledge has furnished us with dozens of machines for throwing water upon fires any one of which would have furnished the ingenious mr hooke the first curator and experimenter of the royal society with ample materials for discourse before half a dozen meetings of that body and that to say truth except for the progress of natural knowledge we should not have been able to make even the tools by which these machines are constructed and further it would be necessary to add that although severe fires sometimes occur and inflict great damage the loss is very generally compensated by societies the operations of which have been rendered possible only by the progress of natural knowledge in the direction of mathematics and the accumulation of wealth in virtue of other natural knowledge but the plague my lord brouncker s observation would not i fear lead him to think that englishmen of the nineteenth century are purer in life or more fervent in religious faith than the generation which could produce a

effort any straining for effect any of that double double toil and trouble by which many even of the weird cauldrons in which genius forms her creations are disturbed and bedimmed that power of doing everything with perfect and conscious ease which dugald stewart has ascribed to barrow and to horsley in prose distinguished dryden in poetry whether he discusses the deep questions of fate and foreknowledge in religio laici or lashes shaftesbury in the medal or pours a torrent of contempt on shadwell in macflecknoe or describes the fire of london in the annus mirabilis or soars into lyric enthusiasm in his ode on the death of mrs killigrew and alexander s feast or paints a tournament in palamon and arcite or a fairy dance in the flower and the leaf he is always at home and always aware that he is his consciousness of his own powers amounts to exultation he is like the steed who glories in that tremendous gallop which affects the spectator with fear indeed we never can separate our conception of dryden s vigorous and vaulting style from the image of a noble horse devouring the dust of the field clearing obstacles at a bound taking up long leagues as a little thing and the very strength and speed of whose motion give it at a distance the appearance of smoothness pope speaks of his long resounding march and energy divine perhaps ease divine had been words more characteristic of that almost superhuman power of language by which he makes the most obstinate materials pliant melts down difficulties as if by the touch of magic and to resume the former figure comes into the goal without a hair turned on his mane or a single sweat drop confessing effort or extraordinary exertion we know no poet since homer who can be compared to dryden in this respect except scott who occasionally in marmion and the lay of the last minstrel exhibits the same impetuous ease and fiery fluent movement scott does not however in general carry the same weight as the other and the species of verse he uses in comparison to the heroic rhyme of dryden gives you often the impression of a hard trot rather than of a long resounding and magnificent gallop scott exhibits in his poetry the soul of a warrior but it is of a warrior of the border somewhat savage and coarse dryden can for the nonce at least assume the appearance and display the spirit of a knight of ancient chivalry gallant accomplished elegant and gay next to this poet s astonishing ease spirit and elastic vigour may be ranked his clear sharp intellect he may be called more a logician than a poet he reasons often and always acutely and his rhyme instead of shackling strengthens the movement of his argumentation parts of his religio laici and the hind and panther resemble portions of duns scotus or aquinas set on fire indeed keen strong intellect inflamed with passion and inspirited by that ardour and impetuosity of mind which wordsworth is compelled to allow to him rather than creative or original genius is the differentia of dryden we have compared him to a courser but he was not one of those coursers of achilles who fed on no earthly food but on the golden barley of heaven having sprung from the gods greek xanthon kai balion to ama pnoiaesi petesthaen tous eteke zephuro anemo arpua podargae dryden resembled rather the mortal steed which was yoked with these immortal twain the brood of zephyr and the harpy podarga only we can hardly say of the poet what homer says of pedasus greek os kai thnaetos eon epeth ippois athanatoisi he was not although a mortal able to keep up with the immortal coursers his path was on the plains or table lands of earth never or seldom in cloudland gorgeous land or through the aerial altitudes which stretch away and above the clouds to the gates of heaven he can hardly be said to have possessed the power of sublimity in the high sense of that term as the power of sympathising with the feeling of the infinite often he gives us the impression of the picturesque of the beautiful of the heroic of the nobly disdainful but never when writing at least entirely from his own mind of that infinite and nameless grandeur which the imaginative soul feels shed on it from the multitudinous waves of ocean from the cataract leaping from his rock as if to consummate an act of prayer to god from the hum of great assemblies of men from the sight of far extended wastes and wildernesses and from the awful silence and the still more mysterious sparkle of the midnight stars this sense of the presence of the shadow of immensity immensity itself cannot be felt any more than measured this sight like that vouchsafed to moses of the backparts of the divine the divine itself cannot be seen has been the inspiration of all the highest poetry of the world of the paradise lost of the divina commedia of the night thoughts of wordsworth and coleridge of festus and highest far of the hebrew prophets as they cry whither can we go from thy presence whither can we flee from thy spirit such poets have resembled a blind man who feels although he cannot see that a stranger of commanding air is in the room beside him so they stand awe struck in the wind of the going of a majestic and unseen being this feeling differs from mysticism inasmuch as it is connected with a reality while the mystic dreams a vague and unsupported dream and the poetry it produces is simply the irresistible cry springing from the perception of this wondrous some one who is actually near them the feeling is connected in general with a lofty moral and religious nature and yet not always since while wanting in dryden we find it intensely discovered although in an imperfect and perverted shape in by

effort any straining for effect any of that double double toil and trouble by which many even of the weird cauldrons in which genius forms her creations are disturbed and bedimmed that power of doing everything with perfect and conscious ease which dugald stewart has ascribed to barrow and to horsley in prose distinguished dryden in poetry whether he discusses the deep questions of fate and foreknowledge in religio laici or lashes shaftesbury in the medal or pours a torrent of contempt on shadwell in macflecknoe or describes the fire of london in the annus mirabilis or soars into lyric enthusiasm in his ode on the death of mrs killigrew and alexander s feast or paints a tournament in palamon and arcite or a fairy dance in the flower and the leaf he is always at home and always aware that he is his consciousness of his own powers amounts to exultation he is like the steed who glories in that tremendous gallop which affects the spectator with fear indeed we never can separate our conception of dryden s vigorous and vaulting style from the image of a noble horse devouring the dust of the field clearing obstacles at a bound taking up long leagues as a little thing and the very strength and speed of whose motion give it at a distance the appearance of smoothness pope speaks of his long resounding march and energy divine perhaps ease divine had been words more characteristic of that almost superhuman power of language by which he makes the most obstinate materials pliant melts down difficulties as if by the touch of magic and to resume the former figure comes into the goal without a hair turned on his mane or a single sweat drop confessing effort or extraordinary exertion we know no poet since homer who can be compared to dryden in this respect except scott who occasionally in marmion and the lay of the last minstrel exhibits the same impetuous ease and fiery fluent movement scott does not however in general carry the same weight as the other and the species of verse he uses in comparison to the heroic rhyme of dryden gives you often the impression of a hard trot rather than of a long resounding and magnificent gallop scott exhibits in his poetry the soul of a warrior but it is of a warrior of the border somewhat savage and coarse dryden can for the nonce at least assume the appearance and display the spirit of a knight of ancient chivalry gallant accomplished elegant and gay next to this poet s astonishing ease spirit and elastic vigour may be ranked his clear sharp intellect he may be called more a logician than a poet he reasons often and always acutely and his rhyme instead of shackling strengthens the movement of his argumentation parts of his religio laici and the hind and panther resemble portions of duns scotus or aquinas set on fire indeed keen strong intellect inflamed with passion and inspirited by that ardour and impetuosity of mind which wordsworth is compelled to allow to him rather than creative or original genius is the differentia of dryden we have compared him to a courser but he was not one of those coursers of achilles who fed on no earthly food but on the golden barley of heaven having sprung from the gods greek xanthon kai balion to ama pnoiaesi petesthaen tous eteke zephuro anemo arpua podargae dryden resembled rather the mortal steed which was yoked with these immortal twain the brood of zephyr and the harpy podarga only we can hardly say of the poet what homer says of pedasus greek os kai thnaetos eon epeth ippois athanatoisi he was not although a mortal able to keep up with the immortal coursers his path was on the plains or table lands of earth never or seldom in cloudland gorgeous land or through the aerial altitudes which stretch away and above the clouds to the gates of heaven he can hardly be said to have possessed the power of sublimity in the high sense of that term as the power of sympathising with the feeling of the infinite often he gives us the impression of the picturesque of the beautiful of the heroic of the nobly disdainful but never when writing at least entirely from his own mind of that infinite and nameless grandeur which the imaginative soul feels shed on it from the multitudinous waves of ocean from the cataract leaping from his rock as if to consummate an act of prayer to god from the hum of great assemblies of men from the sight of far extended wastes and wildernesses and from the awful silence and the still more mysterious sparkle of the midnight stars this sense of the presence of the shadow of immensity immensity itself cannot be felt any more than measured this sight like that vouchsafed to moses of the backparts of the divine the divine itself cannot be seen has been the inspiration of all the highest poetry of the world of the paradise lost of the divina commedia of the night thoughts of wordsworth and coleridge of festus and highest far of the hebrew prophets as they cry whither can we go from thy presence whither can we flee from thy spirit such poets have resembled a blind man who feels although he cannot see that a stranger of commanding air is in the room beside him so they stand awe struck in the wind of the going of a majestic and unseen being this feeling differs from mysticism inasmuch as it is connected with a reality while the mystic dreams a vague and unsupported dream and the poetry it produces is simply the irresistible cry springing from the perception of this wondrous some one who is actually near them the feeling is connected in general with a lofty moral and religious nature and yet not always since while wanting in dryden we find it intensely discovered although in an imperfect and perverted shape in by
