Let us see, then, in his own case what were', 'these two main sets of conditioning circumstances which finally led up', 'to the joint production of Charles Darwin, the man and the philosopher,', 'the thinking brain and the moving energy. In other words, what was the', 'state of the science of life at the time when he first began to observe', 'and to speculate; and what was the ancestry which made him be born a', 'person capable of helping it forward at a single bound over its great', 'restricting dogmatic barrier of the fixity of species?', '', 'Let us begin, in the first place, by clearing the path beforehand of a', 'popular misconception, so extremely general and almost universal that,', 'unless it be got rid of at the very outset of our sketch, much of the', ""real scope and purport of Darwin's life and work must, of necessity,"", 'remain entirely misunderstood by the vast mass of English readers. In', 'the public mind Darwin is, perhaps, most commonly regarded as the', 'discoverer and founder of the evolution hypothesis. Two ideas are', 'usually associated with his name and memory. It is believed that he was', 'the first propounder of the theory which supposes all plant and animal', 'forms to be the result, not of special creation, but of slow', 'modification in pre-existent organisms. It is further and more', 'particularly believed that he was the first propounder of the theory', 'which supposes the descent of man to be traceable from a remote and more', 'or less monkey-like ancestor. Now, as a matter of fact, Darwin was not', 'the prime originator of either of these two great cardinal ideas.

The', 'external events are placed upon record, either in the letters or in', 'the connecting links of narrative; the character and opinions of Mrs.', 'Browning reveal themselves in her correspondence; and her genius is', 'enshrined in her poetry. And these three elements make up all that may', 'be known of her personality, all with which a biographer has to deal.', '', 'It is essentially her character, not her genius, that is presented', 'to the reader of these letters.

Such, in their very different ways,', 'with very different types of genius and very different habits of daily', 'life, are Gray, Cowper, Lamb, perhaps Fitzgerald.

Not all truth, even about famous', 'men, is useful for publication, but only such as enables us to', 'appreciate better the works which have made them famous. Their highest', 'selves are expressed in their literary work; and it is a poor service', 'to truth to insist on bringing to light the fact that they also had', 'lower selves--common, dull, it may be vicious.

But we can hardly regard Milton as having expressed any new', 'decision in _Comus_: the decision is already made when ""vain deluding', 'Joys"" are banished in _Il Penseroso_, and ""loathed Melancholy"" in', ""_L'Allegro_. The mask is an expansion and exaltation of the delights of"", 'the contemplative man, but there is still a place for the ""unreproved', 'pleasures"" of the cheerful man. Unless it were so, _Comus_ could not', 'have been written; there would have been no ""sunshine holiday"" for the', 'rustics and no ""victorious dance"" for the gentle lady and her brothers.', ""But in _Comus_ we realise the mutual relation of _L'Allegro_ and _Il"", 'Penseroso_; we see their application to the joys and sorrows of the', 'actual life of individuals; we observe human nature in contact with the', '""hard assays"" of life. And, subsequently, in _Lycidas_ we are made to', ""realise that this human nature is Milton's own, and to understand how it"", 'was that his Puritanism which, three years before, had permitted him to', 'write a cavalier mask, should, three years after, lead him from the', 'fresh fields of poetry into the barren plains of controversial prose.', '', ""The Mask was a favourite form of entertainment in England in Milton's"", 'youth, and had been so from the time of Henry VIII., in whose reign', 'elaborate masked shows, introduced from Italy, first became popular.

What can be done by a really sustained', 'research into a particular question--especially if it is a question', 'essentially mechanical--is shown by the work of a Frenchman all too', 'neglected by the trumpet of fame--Clement Ader. M. Ader was probably the', 'first man to get a mechanism up into the air for something more than a', 'leap. His _Eole_, as General Mensier testifies, prolonged a jump as far', 'as fifty metres as early as 1890. In 1897 his _Avion_ fairly flew. (This', ""is a year ahead of the date of my earliest photograph of S.P. Langley's"", 'aeropile in mid-air.) This, however, is beside our present mark. The', 'fact of interest here is that in 1908, when flying was still almost', 'incredible, M. Ader published his ""Aviation Militaire."" Well, that was', 'eight years ago, and men have been fighting in the air now for a year,', 'and there is still nothing being done that M. Ader did not see, and', 'which we, if we had had the wisdom to attend to him, might not have been', 'prepared for. There is much that he foretells which is still awaiting', 'its inevitable fulfilment. So clearly can men of adequate knowledge and', 'sound reasoning power see into the years ahead in all such matters of', 'material development.', '', 'But it is not with the development of mechanical inventions that the', 'writer now proposes to treat. In this book he intends to hazard certain', 'forecasts about the trend of events in the next decade or so. Mechanical', 'novelties will probably play a very small part in that coming history.', 'This world-wide war means a general arrest of invention and enterprise,', 'except in the direction of the war business. Ability is concentrated', 'upon that; the types of ability that are not applicable to warfare are', 'neglected; there is a vast destruction of capital and a waste of the', 'savings that are needed to finance new experiments.

In', 'the trenches of France and Flanders, and on the battlefields of Russia,', 'the Germans have been spending and making the world spend the comfort,', 'the luxury and the progress of the next quarter-century.

It is a question of ""How are people going to', ""take these obvious things--waste of the world's resources, arrest of"", 'material progress, the killing of a large moiety of the males in nearly', 'every European country, and universal loss and unhappiness?""

This question is the probability of the establishment of a', 'long world peace.', '', 'At the outset of the war there was a very widely felt hope among the', 'intellectuals of the world that this war might clear up most of the', 'outstanding international problems, and prove the last war. The writer,', 'looking across the gulf of experience that separates us from 1914,', 'recalls two pamphlets whose very titles are eloquent of this', 'feeling--""The War that will End War,"" and ""The Peace of the World."" Was', 'the hope expressed in those phrases a dream? Is it already proven a', 'dream? Or can we read between the lines of the war news, diplomatic', 'disputations, threats and accusations, political wranglings and stories', 'of hardship and cruelty that now fill our papers, anything that still', 'justifies a hope that these bitter years of world sorrow are the', 'darkness before the dawn of a better day for mankind? Let us handle this', 'problem for a preliminary examination.', '', 'What is really being examined here is the power of human reason to', 'prevail over passion--and certain other restraining and qualifying', 'forces. There can be little doubt that, if one could canvass all mankind', 'and ask them whether they would rather have no war any more, the', 'overwhelming mass of them would elect for universal peace. If it were', 'war of the modern mechanical type that was in question, with air raids,', 'high explosives, poison gas and submarines, there could be no doubt at', 'all about the response.

The Krupp-Kaiser', 'Empire, he assures us, is no eagle, but a double-headed lamb, resisting', 'the shearers and butchers.

If we are to talk about 'popular"", ""histories,' the writer who distances every competitor by an"", 'immeasurable distance is Macaulay.

Mr. Green, for instance, was not strong in his grasp of the"", 'eighteenth century, and that period is in many respects an extremely', 'unsatisfactory part of his work. Yet if we turn to his _History of the', 'English People_, this is what we find at the very outset of the', 'section that deals with modern England:--', '', ""     The Seven Years' War is in fact a turning point in our national"", '     history, as it is a turning point in the history of the world....', ""     From the close of the Seven Years' War it mattered little whether"", '     England counted for less or more with the nations around her.

Old Aaron is not an', 'exaggeration of Jewish virtues; he is simply not Jewish, because he is', 'not human.

It', 'seems as if he had avenged himself for the doubt about Fagin by', 'introducing five or six Fagins--triumphant Fagins, fashionable Fagins,', 'Fagins who had changed their names. The impeccable old Aaron stands up', 'in the middle of this ironic carnival with a peculiar solemnity and', 'silliness. He looks like one particularly stupid Englishman pretending', 'to be a Jew, amidst all that crowd of clever Jews who are pretending to', 'be Englishmen.', '', 'But this notion of a sneer is not admissible.

We are not, however, to infer that', 'its acceptance or rejection must depend on blind impulse, or arbitrary', 'choice. There is a larger meaning of the word proof, in which this', 'question is as amenable to it as any other of the disputed questions of', 'philosophy.

For seven or eight', 'generations in a direct and unbroken line his forefathers had been', 'preachers and divines, not without eminence in the Puritan tradition of', 'New England. His second name came into the family with Rebecca Waldo,', 'with whom at the end of the seventeenth century one Edward Emerson had', 'intermarried, and whose family had fled from the Waldensian valleys and', 'that slaughter of the saints which Milton called on Heaven to avenge.', 'Every tributary, then, that made Emerson what he was, flowed not only', ""from Protestantism, but from 'the Protestantism of the Protestant"", ""religion.' When we are told that Puritanism inexorably locked up the"", 'intelligence of its votaries in a dark and straitened chamber, it is', 'worthy to be remembered that the genial, open, lucid, and most', 'comprehensive mind of Emerson was the ripened product of a genealogical', 'tree that at every stage of its growth had been vivified by Puritan sap.', '', ""Not many years after his birth, Emerson's mother was left a widow with"", 'narrow means, and he underwent the wholesome training of frugality in', 'youth. When the time came, he was sent to Harvard. When Clough visited', 'America a generation later, the collegiate training does not appear to', ""have struck him very favourably.

This was said from the standard of Rugby and Balliol, and"", 'the method that Clough calls imperfect had merits of its own.

On the other hand, the training at Harvard struck fewer of those', 'superfluous roots in the mind, which are only planted that they may be', 'presently cast out again with infinite distraction and waste.', '', 'When his schooling was over, Emerson began to prepare himself for the', 'ministrations of the pulpit, and in 1826 and 1827 he preached in divers', 'places. Two years later he was ordained, and undertook the charge of an', 'important Unitarian Church in Boston. It was not very long before the', 'strain of forms, comparatively moderate as it was in the Unitarian body,', 'became too heavy to be borne. Emerson found that he could no longer', 'accept the usual view of the Communion Service, even in its least', 'sacramental interpretation. To him the rite was purely spiritual in', 'origin and intent, and at the best only to be retained as a', 'commemoration. The whole world, he said, had been full of idols and', ""ordinances and forms, when 'the Almighty God was pleased to qualify and"", 'send forth a man to teach men that they must serve him with the heart;', 'that only that life was religious which was thoroughly good; that', 'sacrifice was smoke and forms were shadows. This man lived and died true', 'to that purpose; and now with his blessed word and life before us,', 'Christians must contend that it is a matter of vital importance, really', 'a duty, to commemorate him by a certain form, whether that form be', 'agreeable to their understandings or not.

With me were a cross-eyed rascal named', 'Ali--Ali Baba I named him--the man from whom I got the ring which I am', 'sending you, and a small but choice assortment of his fellow thieves.', 'Within an hour after sunrise we reached the valley where the tomb is. It', 'is a desolate place, into which the sun pours his scorching heat all', 'the long day through, till the huge brown rocks which are strewn about', 'become so hot that one can scarcely bear to touch them, and the sand', 'scorches the feet. It was already too hot to walk, so we rode on', 'donkeys, some way up the valley--where a vulture floating far in the', 'blue overhead was the only other visitor--till we came to an enormous', 'boulder polished by centuries of action of sun and sand. Here Ali', 'halted, saying that the tomb was under the stone. Accordingly, we', 'dismounted, and, leaving the donkeys in charge of a fellah boy, went up', 'to the rock. Beneath it was a small hole, barely large enough for a man', 'to creep through. Indeed it had been dug by jackals, for the doorway and', 'some part of the cave were entirely silted up, and it was by means of', 'this jackal hole that the tomb had been discovered. Ali crept in on his', 'hands and knees, and I followed, to find myself in a place cold after', 'the hot outside air, and, in contrast with the light, filled with a', 'dazzling darkness. We lit our candles, and, the select body of thieves', 'having arrived, I made an examination. We were in a cave the size of', 'a large room, and hollowed by hand, the further part of the cave being', 'almost free from drift-dust. On the walls are religious paintings of the', 'usual Ptolemaic character, and among them one of a majestic old man with', 'a long white beard, who is seated in a carved chair holding a wand in', 'his hand.[*] Before him passes a procession of priests bearing sacred', 'images. In the right hand corner of the tomb is the shaft of the', 'mummy-pit, a square-mouthed well cut in the black rock. We had brought a', 'beam of thorn-wood, and this was now laid across the pit and a rope', 'made fast to it. Then Ali--who, to do him justice, is a courageous', 'thief--took hold of the rope, and, putting some candles into the breast', 'of his robe, placed his bare feet against the smooth sides of the well', 'and began to descent with great rapidity. Very soon he had vanished into', 'blackness, and the agitation of the cord alone told us that anything was', 'going on below. At last the rope ceased shaking and a faint shout came', ""rumbling up the well, announcing Ali's safe arrival. Then, far below, a"", 'tiny star of light appeared. He had lit the candle, thereby disturbing', 'hundreds of bats that flitted up in an endless stream and as silently as', 'spirits. The rope was hauled up again, and now it was my turn; but, as', 'I declined to trust my neck to the hand-over-hand method of descent, the', 'end of the cord was made fast round my middle and I was lowered bodily', 'into those sacred depths. Nor was it a pleasant journey, for, if the', 'masters of the situation above had made any mistake, I should have been', 'dashed to pieces. Also, the bats continually flew into my face and clung', 'to my hair, and I have a great dislike of bats.

The subject of the Drama rather', 'fastened on me than was chosen; and the form, approaching the model of', 'the Greek tragedy, shaped itself under my hand, rather by force of', 'pleasure than of design. But when the excitement of composition had', 'subsided, I felt afraid of my position. My subject was the new and', 'strange experience of the fallen humanity, as it went forth from', ""Paradise into the wilderness; with a peculiar reference to Eve's"", 'allotted grief, which, considering that self-sacrifice belonged to her', 'womanhood, and the consciousness of originating the Fall to her', 'offence,--appeared to me imperfectly apprehended hitherto, and more', 'expressible by a woman than a man. There was room, at least, for lyrical', 'emotion in those first steps into the wilderness,--in that first sense', 'of desolation after wrath,--in that first audible gathering of the', 'recriminating ""groan of the whole creation,""--in that first darkening of', 'the hills from the recoiling feet of angels,--and in that first silence', 'of the voice of God. And I took pleasure in driving in, like a pile,', 'stroke upon stroke, the Idea of EXILE,--admitting Lucifer as an extreme', 'Adam, to represent the ultimate tendencies of sin and loss,--that it', 'might be strong to bear up the contrary idea of the Heavenly love and', 'purity. But when all was done, I felt afraid, as I said before, of my', 'position. I had promised my own prudence to shut close the gates of Eden', 'between Milton and myself, so that none might say I dared to walk in his', 'footsteps. He should be within, I thought, with his Adam and Eve', 'unfallen or falling,--and I, without, with my EXILES,--_I_ also an', 'exile! It would not do. The subject, and his glory covering it, swept', 'through the gates, and I stood full in it, against my will, and contrary', 'to my vow,--till I shrank back fearing, almost desponding; hesitating to', 'venture even a passing association with our great poet before the face', 'of the public. Whether at last I took courage for the venture, by a', 'sudden revival of that love of manuscript which should be classed by', 'moral philosophers among the natural affections, or by the encouraging', 'voice of a dear friend, it is not interesting to the reader to inquire.', 'Neither could the fact affect the question; since I bear, of course, my', 'own responsibilities. For the rest, Milton is too high, and I am too', 'low, to render it necessary for me to disavow any rash emulation of his', 'divine faculty on his own ground; while enough individuality will be', 'granted, I hope, to my poem, to rescue me from that imputation of', 'plagiarism which should be too servile a thing for every sincere', 'thinker. After all, and at the worst, I have only attempted, in respect', 'to Milton, what the Greek dramatists achieved lawfully in respect to', 'Homer. They constructed dramas on Trojan ground; they raised on the', 'buskin and even clasped with the sock, the feet of Homeric heroes; yet', 'they neither imitated their Homer nor emasculated him.

To this analogy--the', ""more favourable to me from the obvious exception in it, that Homer's"", ""subject was his own possibly by creation,--whereas Milton's was his own"", 'by illustration only,--I appeal.

For the analogy of the stronger', 'may apply to the weaker; and the reader may have patience with the', 'weakest while she suggests the application.', '', 'On a graver point I must take leave to touch, in further reference to my', 'dramatic poem.

So, again, no animal or plant puts on its', 'perfect form at once, but all have to start from the same point, however', 'various the course which each has to pursue. Not only men and horses, and', 'cats and dogs, lobsters and beetles, periwinkles and mussels, but even the', 'very sponges and animalcules commence their existence under forms which are', 'essentially undistinguishable; and this is true of all the infinite variety', 'of plants. Nay, more, all living beings march, side by side, along the high', 'road of development, and separate the later the more like they are; like', 'people leaving church, who all go down the aisle, but having reached the', 'door, some turn into the parsonage, others go down the village, and others', 'part only in the next parish.

The old gentleman woke with', 'more than his customary alacrity, and, after taking a moment to gather his', 'wits about him, pulled aside the faded moreen curtains of his ancient bed,', 'and thrust his head into a beam of sunshine that caused him to wink and', 'withdraw it again. This transitory glimpse of good Dr. Dolliver showed a', 'flannel night-cap, fringed round with stray locks of silvery white hair,', 'and surmounting a meagre and duskily yellow visage, which was crossed and', 'criss-crossed with a record of his long life in wrinkles, faithfully', 'written, no doubt, but with such cramped chirography of Father Time that', 'the purport was illegible. It seemed hardly worth while for the patriarch', 'to get out of bed any more, and bring his forlorn shadow into the summer', 'day that was made for younger folks. The Doctor, however, was by no means', 'of that opinion, being considerably encouraged towards the toil of living', 'twenty-four hours longer by the comparative ease with which he found', 'himself going through the usually painful process of bestirring his rusty', 'joints (stiffened by the very rest and sleep that should have made them', 'pliable) and putting them in a condition to bear his weight upon the', 'floor. Nor was he absolutely disheartened by the idea of those tonsorial,', 'ablutionary, and personally decorative labors which are apt to become so', 'intolerably irksome to an old gentleman, after performing them daily and', 'daily for fifty, sixty, or seventy years, and finding them still as', 'immitigably recurrent as at first. Dr. Dolliver could nowise account for', 'this happy condition of his spirits and physical energies, until he', 'remembered taking an experimental sip of a certain cordial which was long', 'ago prepared by his grandson, and carefully sealed up in a bottle, and had', 'been reposited in a dark closet, among a parcel of effete medicines, ever', ""since that gifted young man's death."", '', '""It may have wrought effect upon me,"" thought the doctor, shaking his head', 'as he lifted it again from the pillow. ""It may be so; for poor Edward', 'oftentimes instilled a strange efficacy into his perilous drugs. But I', ""will rather believe it to be the operation of God's mercy, which may have"", 'temporarily invigorated my feeble age for little Pansie\'s sake.""', '', 'A twinge of his familiar rheumatism, as he put his foot out of bed, taught', ""him that he must not reckon too confidently upon even a day's respite from"", 'the intrusive family of aches and infirmities, which, with their', 'proverbial fidelity to attachments once formed, had long been the closest', 'acquaintances that the poor old gentleman had in the world. Nevertheless,', 'he fancied the twinge a little less poignant than those of yesterday; and,', 'moreover, after stinging him pretty smartly, it passed gradually off with', 'a thrill, which, in its latter stages, grew to be almost agreeable. Pain', 'is but pleasure too strongly emphasized. With cautious movements, and only', 'a groan or two, the good Doctor transferred himself from the bed to the', 'floor, where he stood awhile, gazing from one piece of quaint furniture to', 'another (such as stiff-backed Mayflower chairs, an oaken chest-of-drawers', 'carved cunningly with shapes of animals and wreaths of foliage, a table', 'with multitudinous legs, a family record in faded embroidery, a shelf of', 'black-bound books, a dirty heap of gallipots and phials in a dim', 'corner),--gazing at these things, and steadying himself by the bedpost,', 'while his inert brain, still partially benumbed with sleep, came slowly', 'into accordance with the realities about him. The object which most helped', 'to bring Dr. Dolliver completely to his waking perceptions was one that', 'common observers might suppose to have been snatched bodily out of his', 'dreams.

'Pray tell me all about it!'"", '', 'So his mother told him a story that her own mother had told to her, when', 'she herself was younger than little Ernest; a story, not of things that', 'were past, but of what was yet to come; a story, nevertheless, so very', 'old, that even the Indians, who formerly inhabited this valley, had', 'heard it from their forefathers, to whom, as they affirmed, it had been', 'murmured by the mountain streams, and whispered by the wind among the', 'tree-tops. The purport was, that, at some future day, a child should', 'be born hereabouts, who was destined to become the greatest and noblest', 'personage of his time, and whose countenance, in manhood, should bear', 'an exact resemblance to the Great Stone Face. Not a few old-fashioned', 'people, and young ones likewise, in the ardor of their hopes, still', 'cherished an enduring faith in this old prophecy. But others, who had', 'seen more of the world, had watched and waited till they were weary, and', 'had beheld no man with such a face, nor any man that proved to be much', 'greater or nobler than his neighbors, concluded it to be nothing but', 'an idle tale. At all events, the great man of the prophecy had not yet', 'appeared.', '', ""'O mother, dear mother!' cried Ernest, clapping his hands above his head,"", ""'I do hope that I shall live to see him!'"", '', 'His mother was an affectionate and thoughtful woman, and felt that it', 'was wisest not to discourage the generous hopes of her little boy. So', ""she only said to him, 'Perhaps you may.'"", '', 'And Ernest never forgot the story that his mother told him. It was', 'always in his mind, whenever he looked upon the Great Stone Face.', 'He spent his childhood in the log-cottage where he was born, and was', 'dutiful to his mother, and helpful to her in many things, assisting', 'her much with his little hands, and more with his loving heart. In this', 'manner, from a happy yet often pensive child, he grew up to be a mild,', 'quiet, unobtrusive boy, and sun-browned with labor in the fields, but', 'with more intelligence brightening his aspect than is seen in many lads', 'who have been taught at famous schools. Yet Ernest had had no teacher,', 'save only that the Great Stone Face became one to him. When the toil', 'of the day was over, he would gaze at it for hours, until he began to', 'imagine that those vast features recognized him, and gave him a smile of', 'kindness and encouragement, responsive to his own look of veneration.', 'We must not take upon us to affirm that this was a mistake, although', 'the Face may have looked no more kindly at Ernest than at all the', ""world besides. But the secret was that the boy's tender and confiding"", 'simplicity discerned what other people could not see; and thus the love,', 'which was meant for all, became his peculiar portion.', '', 'About this time there went a rumor throughout the valley, that the great', 'man, foretold from ages long ago, who was to bear a resemblance to', 'the Great Stone Face, had appeared at last. It seems that, many years', 'before, a young man had migrated from the valley and settled at a', 'distant seaport, where, after getting together a little money, he had', 'set up as a shopkeeper. His name but I could never learn whether it was', 'his real one, or a nickname that had grown out of his habits and success', 'in life--was Gathergold.', '', 'Being shrewd and active, and endowed by Providence with that inscrutable', 'faculty which develops itself in what the world calls luck, he became an', 'exceedingly rich merchant, and owner of a whole fleet of bulky-bottomed', 'ships. All the countries of the globe appeared to join hands for the', 'mere purpose of adding heap after heap to the mountainous accumulation', ""of this one man's wealth. The cold regions of the north, almost within"", 'the gloom and shadow of the Arctic Circle, sent him their tribute in the', 'shape of furs; hot Africa sifted for him the golden sands of her rivers,', 'and gathered up the ivory tusks of her great elephants out of the', 'forests; the east came bringing him the rich shawls, and spices, and', 'teas, and the effulgence of diamonds, and the gleaming purity of large', 'pearls. The ocean, not to be behindhand with the earth, yielded up her', 'mighty whales, that Mr. Gathergold might sell their oil, and make a', 'profit on it. Be the original commodity what it might, it was gold', 'within his grasp. It might be said of him, as of Midas, in the fable,', 'that whatever he touched with his finger immediately glistened, and grew', 'yellow, and was changed at once into sterling metal, or, which suited', 'him still better, into piles of coin. And, when Mr. Gathergold had', 'become so very rich that it would have taken him a hundred years only', 'to count his wealth, he bethought himself of his native valley, and', 'resolved to go back thither, and end his days where he was born. With', 'this purpose in view, he sent a skilful architect to build him such a', 'palace as should be fit for a man of his vast wealth to live in.', '', 'As I have said above, it had already been rumored in the valley that', 'Mr. Gathergold had turned out to be the prophetic personage so long and', 'vainly looked for, and that his visage was the perfect and undeniable', 'similitude of the Great Stone Face. People were the more ready to', 'believe that this must needs be the fact, when they beheld the splendid', ""edifice that rose, as if by enchantment, on the site of his father's"", 'old weather-beaten farmhouse. The exterior was of marble, so dazzlingly', 'white that it seemed as though the whole structure might melt away in', 'the sunshine, like those humbler ones which Mr. Gathergold, in his', 'young play-days, before his fingers were gifted with the touch of', 'transmutation, had been accustomed to build of snow. It had a richly', 'ornamented portico supported by tall pillars, beneath which was a lofty', 'door, studded with silver knobs, and made of a kind of variegated wood', 'that had been brought from beyond the sea. The windows, from the floor', 'to the ceiling of each stately apartment, were composed, respectively', 'of but one enormous pane of glass, so transparently pure that it was', 'said']"

It was in one of', 'these villas that Nero was born.', '', ""Nero's father belonged to a family which had enjoyed for several"", 'generations a considerable degree of distinction among the Roman', 'nobility, though known by a somewhat whimsical name. The family name', 'was Brazenbeard, or, to speak more exactly, it was Ahenobarbus,', 'which is the Latin equivalent for that word. It is a question', ""somewhat difficult to decide, whether in speaking of Nero's father"", 'at the present time, and in the English tongue, we should make use', 'of the actual Latin name, or translate the word and employ the', 'English representative of it; that is, whether we shall call him', 'Ahenobarbus or Brazenbeard. The former seems to be more in harmony', 'with our ideas of the dignity of Roman history; while the latter,', 'though less elegant, conveys probably to our minds a more exact idea', 'of the import and expression of the name as it sounded in the ears', 'of the Roman community. The name certainly was not an attractive', 'one, though the family had contrived to dignify it some degree by', 'assigning to it a preternatural origin. There was a tradition that', 'in ancient times a prophet appeared to one of the ancestors of the', 'line, and after foretelling certain extraordinary events which were', 'to occur at some future period, stroked down the beard of his', 'auditor with his hand, and changed it to the color of brass, in', 'miraculous attestation of the divine authority of the message. The', 'man received the name of Brazenbeard in consequence, and he and his', 'descendants ever afterward retained it.', '', 'The family of the Brazenbeards was one of high rank and distinction,', ""though at the time of Nero's birth it was, like most of the other"", ""prominent Roman families, extremely profligate and corrupt. Nero's"", 'father, especially, was a very bad man. He was accused of the very', 'worst of crimes, and he led a life of constant remorse and terror.', ""His wife, Agrippina, Nero's mother, was as wicked as he; and it is"", 'said that when the messenger came to him to announce the birth of', 'his child, the hero of this narrative, he uttered some exclamation', 'of ill-humor and contempt, and said that whatever came from him and', 'Agrippina could not but be fraught with ruin to Rome.', '', 'The rank and station of Agrippina in Roman society was even higher', 'than that of her husband. She was the sister of the emperor. The', 'name of the emperor, her brother, was Caligula. He was the third in', 'the series of Roman emperors, Augustus CÃ¦sar, the successor of', 'Julius CÃ¦sar, having been the first. The term emperor, however, had', 'a very different meaning in those days, from its present import. It', 'seems to denote now a sovereign ruler, who exercises officially a', 'general jurisdiction which extends over the whole government of the', 'state. In the days of the Romans it included, in theory at least,', 'only _military_ command. The word was _imperator_, which meant', '_commander_; and the station which it denoted was simply that of', 'general-in-chief over the military forces of the republic.', '', 'In the early periods of the Roman history, every possible precaution', 'was taken to keep the military power in a condition of very strict', 'subordination to the authority of the civil magistrate and of law.', 'Very stringent regulations were adopted to secure this end. No', 'portion of the army, except such small detachments as were required', 'for preserving order within the walls, was allowed to approach the', 'city. Great commanders, in returning from their victorious', 'campaigns, were obliged to halt and encamp at some distance from the', 'gates, and there await the orders of the Roman Senate. The _Senate_', 'was, in theory, the great repository of political power. This Senate', 'was not, however, as the word might seem in modern times to denote,', 'a well-defined and compact body of legislators, designated', 'individually to the office, but rather a class of hereditary nobles,', 'very numerous, and deriving their power from immemorial usage, and', 'from that strange and unaccountable feeling of deference and awe', 'with which the mass of mankind always look up to an established, and', 'especially an ancient, aristocracy. The Senate were accustomed to', 'convene at stated times, in assemblages which were, sometimes,', 'conducted with a proper degree of formality and order, and sometimes', 'on the other hand, exhibited scenes of great tumult and confusion.', 'Their power, however, whether regularly or irregularly exercised,', 'was supreme. They issued edicts, they enacted laws, they allotted', 'provinces, they made peace, and they declared war. The armies, and', 'the generals who commanded them, were the _agents_ employed to do', 'their bidding.', '', 'The Roman armies consisted of vast bodies of men which, when not in', 'actual service, were established in permanent encampments in various', 'parts of the empire, wherever it was deemed necessary that troops', 'should be stationed. These great bodies of troops were the', 'celebrated Roman legions, and they were renowned throughout the', 'world for their discipline, their admirable organization, the', 'celerity of their movements, and for the indomitable courage and', 'energy of the men.

No; he must make an effort. The time of', 'his penance has come, and the penance must be borne.

A pleasing French writer of fairy tales, Monsieur Pajon,', 'author of the History of Prince Soly, has set a diverting example of', 'the same machinery, where he introduces the presiding Genius of the', 'land of Romance conversing with one of the personages of the tale.', '', 'In this Introductory Epistle, the author communicates, in confidence,', 'to Captain Clutterbuck, his sense that the White Lady had not met the', 'taste of the times, and his reason for withdrawing her from the scene.', 'The author did not deem it equally necessary to be candid respecting', 'another alteration. The Monastery was designed, at first, to have', 'contained some supernatural agency, arising out of the fact, that', ""Melrose had been the place of deposit of the great Robert Bruce's"", 'heart.

Thus, the incident of the discovery of the', 'heart, which occupies the greater part of the Introduction to the', 'Monastery, is a mystery unnecessarily introduced, and which remains at', 'last very imperfectly explained. In this particular, I was happy to', 'shroud myself by the example of the author of ""Caleb Williams,"" who', 'never condescends to inform us of the actual contents of that Iron', 'Chest which makes such a figure in his interesting work, and gives the', ""name to Mr. Colman's drama."", '', 'The public had some claim to inquire into this matter, but it seemed', 'indifferent policy in the author to give the explanation.

He was not positive or opinionated, and he did not deny', 'that at certain moments he pondered and hesitated long before he decided', 'on his course. But though he could keep a policy in suspense, waiting', 'for events to guide him, he did not waver. He paused and reconsidered,', 'but it was never his way either to go back upon a decision once made, or', 'to waste time in vain regrets that all he expected had not been', 'attained.

Simplicity, directness and breadth', 'are the notes of his thought. Aptness, clearness, and again, simplicity,', 'are the notes of his diction. The American speakers of his generation,', 'like most of those of the preceding generation, but unlike those of that', 'earlier generation to which Alexander Hamilton, John Adams, Marshall and', 'Madison belonged, were generally infected by a floridity which made them', 'a by-word in Europe.

Such faults have to-day', 'virtually vanished from the United States, largely from a change in', 'public taste, to which perhaps the example set by Lincoln himself may', 'have contributed. In the forties and fifties florid rhetoric was', 'rampant, especially in the West and South, where taste was less polished', 'than in the older States. That Lincoln escaped it is a striking mark of', 'his independence as well as of his greatness. There is no superfluous', 'ornament in his orations, nothing tawdry, nothing otiose. For the most', 'part, he addresses the reason of his hearers, and credits them with', 'desiring to have none but solid arguments laid before them. When he does', 'appeal to emotion, he does it quietly, perhaps even solemnly. The note', 'struck is always a high note. The impressiveness of the appeal comes not', 'from fervid vehemence of language, but from the sincerity of his own', 'convictions.

This boat we', 'soon found was inhabited by an oyster-man and his family. They had lived', 'there for many years and were really doing quite well. The boat was', 'divided, inside, into rooms, and these were papered and painted and', 'nicely furnished. There was a kitchen, a living-room, a parlor and', 'bedrooms. There were all sorts of conveniences--carpets on the floors,', 'pictures, and everything, at least so it seemed to us, to make a home', 'comfortable. This was not all done at once, the oyster-man told me. They', 'had lived there for years and had gradually added this and that until', 'the place was as we saw it.

When we had finished our supper and had paid for it, and were', 'going down to take our little boat again,--for we had rowed up the', 'river,--Euphemia stopped and looked around her. Then she clasped her', 'hands and exclaimed in an ecstatic undertone:', '', '""We must have a canal-boat!""', '', 'And she never swerved from that determination.', '', 'After I had seriously thought over the matter, I could see no good', 'reason against adopting this plan.

Nutmegs', 'and mace were procured from the natives of New Guinea and the adjacent', 'islands, where they grew wild; and the profits on spice cargoes were so', 'enormous, that the European traders were glad to give gold and jewels,', 'and the finest manufactures of Europe or of India, in exchange. When the', 'Dutch established their influence in these seas, and relieved the native', 'princes from their Portuguese oppressors, they saw that the easiest', 'way to repay themselves would be to get this spice trade into their own', 'hands. For this purpose they adopted the wise principle of concentrating', 'the culture of these valuable products in those spots only of which they', 'could have complete control. To do this effectually it was necessary to', 'abolish the culture and trade in all other places, which they succeeded', 'in doing by treaty with the native rulers. These agreed to have all the', 'spice trees in their possessions destroyed. They gave up large though', 'fluctuating revenues, but they gained in return a fixed subsidy, freedom', 'from the constant attacks and harsh oppressions of the Portuguese, and a', 'continuance of their regal power and exclusive authority over their own', 'subjects, which is maintained in all the islands except Ternate to this', 'day.', '', 'It is no doubt supposed by most Englishmen, who have been accustomed to', 'look upon this act of the Dutch with vague horror, as something', 'utterly unprincipled and barbarous, that the native population suffered', 'grievously by this destruction of such valuable property. But it is', 'certain that this was not the case. The Sultans kept this lucrative', 'trade entirely in their own hands as a rigid monopoly, and they would', 'take care not to give, their subjects more than would amount to their', 'usual wages, while: they would surely exact as large a quantity of spice', 'as they could possibly obtain. Drake and other early voyagers always', 'seem to have purchased their spice-cargoes from the Sultans and Rajahs,', 'and not from the cultivators. Now the absorption of so much labour in', 'the cultivation of this one product must necessarily have raised the', 'price of food and other necessaries; and when it was abolished,', 'more rice would be grown, more sago made, more fish caught, and more', 'tortoise-shell, rattan, gum-dammer, and other valuable products of the', 'seas and the forests would be obtained.

Banda was chosen for', 'nutmegs, and was eminently successful, since it continues to this day', 'to produce a large supply of this spice, and to yield a considerable', 'revenue. Amboyna was fixed upon for establishing the clove cultivation;', 'but the soil and climate, although apparently very similar to that of', 'its native islands, is not favourable, and for some years the Government', 'have actually been paying to the cultivators a higher rate than they', 'could purchase cloves elsewhere, owing to a great fall in the price', 'since the rate of payment was fixed for a term of years by the Dutch', 'Government, and which rate is still most honourably paid.', '', 'In walking about the suburbs of Ternate, we find everywhere the ruins of', 'massive stone and brick buildings, gateways and arches, showing at once', 'the superior wealth of the ancient town and the destructive effects of', 'earthquakes. It was during my second stay in the town, after my return', 'from New Guinea, that I first felt an earthquake. It was a very slight', 'one, scarcely more than has been felt in this country, but occurring in', 'a place that lad been many times destroyed by them it was rather more', 'exciting. I had just awoke at gun-fire (5 A.M.), when suddenly the', 'thatch began to rustle and shake as if an army of cats were galloping', 'over it, and immediately afterwards my bed shook too, so that for an', 'instant I imagined myself back in New Guinea, in my fragile house, which', 'shook when an old cock went to roost on the ridge; but remembering that', 'I was now on a solid earthen floor, I said to myself, ""Why, it\'s an', 'earthquake,"" and lay still in the pleasing expectation of another shock;', 'but none came, and this was the only earthquake I ever felt in Ternate.', '', 'The last great one was in February 1840, when almost every house in the', ""place was destroyed.

But in the middle ages very little could', 'be done in the way of investments like these. There were no railroads,', 'and there was very little use for ships. There was no profit to be', 'gained by building houses and stores, for there were so many wars and', 'commotions among the people of the different towns and kingdoms, that', 'nothing was stable or safe. For the same reason it was useless for men', 'to spend their money in building and ornamenting their own houses, for', 'at the first approach of an enemy, the town in which they lived was', 'likely to be sacked, and their houses, and all the fine furniture which', 'they might contain, would be burned or destroyed.', '', 'But the churches were safe.

To plunder a church, or a convent,', 'or an abbey, or to do any thing to injure or destroy the property that', 'they contained, was regarded as _sacrilege_; and sacrilege they deemed a', 'dreadful crime, abhorred by God and man. Thus, while they would burn and', 'destroy hundreds of dwellings without any remorse, and turn the wretched', 'inmates out at midnight into the streets to die of exposure, terror, and', 'despair, they would stop at once when they came to the church, afraid to', 'harm it in any way, or to touch the least thing that it contained.', 'Accordingly, while every thing else in a conquered town was doomed to', 'the most reckless destruction, all that was in the church,--the most', 'delicate paintings, and the most costly gold and silver images and', 'utensils--were as safe as if they were surrounded by impregnable castle', 'walls.', '', 'Of course these notions were very mistaken ones. According to the', 'teachings of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, it must be a greater sin', 'to burn down the cottage of a poor widow, and turn her out at midnight', 'into the streets to die, than to plunder for gain the richest altar in', 'the world.', '', 'From these and various other similar causes, it happened that, in the', 'middle ages,--that is, from five hundred to a thousand years', 'ago,--almost all the great expenditures of money, in all the great', 'cities and towns of Europe, were made for churches.

This and other social drawbacks which are but too patent,', 'retard the manhood of the working classes.  That it should be so, is a', 'wrong.  For if a citizen have one right above all others to demand', 'anything of his country, it is that he should be educated; that whatever', 'capabilities he may have in him, however small, should have their fair', 'and full chance of development.

To a reasonable household', 'suffrage it cannot apply.  The man who (being almost certainly married,', 'and having children) can afford to rent a 5 pound tenement in a town, or', 'in the country either, has seen quite enough of life, and learnt quite', 'enough of it, to form a very fair judgment of the man who offers to', 'represent him in Parliament; because he has learnt, not merely something', 'of his own interest, or that of his class, but--what is infinitely more', 'important--the difference between the pretender and the honest man.', '', 'The causes of this state of society, which is peculiar to Britain, must', 'be sought far back in the ages.  It would seem that the distinction', 'between ""earl and churl"" (the noble and the non-noble freeman) was', 'crushed out in this island by the two Norman conquests--that of the Anglo-', 'Saxon nobility by Sweyn and Canute; and that of the Anglo-Danish nobility', 'by William and his Frenchmen.  Those two terrible calamities, following', 'each other in the short space of fifty years, seem to have welded', 'together, by a community of suffering, all ranks and races, at least', 'south of the Tweed; and when the English rose after the storm, they rose', 'as one homogeneous people, never to be governed again by an originally', 'alien race.  The English nobility were, from the time of Magna Charta,', 'rather an official nobility, than, as in most continental countries, a', 'separate caste; and whatever caste tendencies had developed themselves', 'before the Wars of the Roses (as such are certain to do during centuries', 'of continued wealth and power), were crushed out by the great', 'revolutionary events of the next hundred years.  Especially did the', 'discovery of the New World, the maritime struggle with Spain, the', 'outburst of commerce and colonisation during the reigns of Elizabeth and', 'James, help toward this good result.  It was in vain for the Lord Oxford', ""of the day, sneering at Raleigh's sudden elevation, to complain that as"", 'on the virginals, so in the State, ""Jacks went up, and heads went down.""', 'The proudest noblemen were not ashamed to have their ventures on the high', 'seas, and to send their younger sons trading, or buccaneering, under the', 'conduct of low-born men like Drake, who ""would like to see the gentleman', 'that would not set his hand to a rope, and hale and draw with the', 'mariners.""  Thus sprang up that respect for, even fondness for, severe', 'bodily labour, which the educated class of no nation save our own has', 'ever felt; and which has stood them in such good stead, whether at home', 'or abroad.

Economy in the Use of Words.', '', 'Â§ 5. The greater forcibleness of Saxon English, or rather non-Latin', 'English, first claims our attention. The several special reasons', 'assignable for this may all be reduced to the general reason--economy.', ""The most important of them is early association. A child's vocabulary is"", 'almost wholly Saxon. He says, _I have,_ not _I possess_---_I wish,_', 'not I _desire;_ he does not _reflect,_ he _thinks;_ he does not beg', 'for _amusement,_ but for _play_; he calls things _nice_ or _nasty,_', 'not _pleasant_ or _disagreeable._ The synonyms which he learns in after', 'years, never become so closely, so organically connected with the ideas', 'signified, as do these original words used in childhood; and hence the', 'association remains less strong. But in what does a strong association', 'between a word and an idea differ from a weak one? Simply in the greater', 'ease and rapidity of the suggestive action. It can be in nothing else.', 'Both of two words, if they be strictly synonymous, eventually call up', 'the same image. The expression--It is _acid,_ must in the end give rise', 'to the same thought as--It is sour; but because the term _acid_ was', 'learnt later in life, and has not been so often followed by the thought', 'symbolized, it does not so readily arouse that thought as the term sour.', 'If we remember how slowly and with what labour the appropriate ideas', 'follow unfamiliar words in another language, and how increasing', 'familiarity with such words brings greater rapidity and ease of', 'comprehension; and if we consider that the same process must have gone', 'on with the words of our mother tongue from childhood upwards, we shall', 'clearly see that the earliest learnt and oftenest used words, will,', 'other things equal, call up images with less loss of time and energy', 'than their later learnt synonyms.', '', 'Â§ 6. The further superiority possessed by Saxon English in its', 'comparative brevity, obviously comes under the same generalization. If', 'it be an advantage to express an idea in the smallest number of words,', 'then will it be an advantage to express it in the smallest number of', 'syllables. If circuitous phrases and needless expletives distract the', 'attention and diminish the strength of the impression produced, then', 'do surplus articulations do so. A certain effort, though commonly', 'an inappreciable one, must be required to recognize every vowel and', 'consonant. If, as all know, it is tiresome to listen to an indistinct', 'speaker, or read a badly-written manuscript; and if, as we cannot doubt,', 'the fatigue is a cumulative result of the attention needed to catch', 'successive syllables; it follows that attention is in such cases', 'absorbed by each syllable. And if this be true when the syllables are', 'difficult of recognition, it will also be true, though in a less degree,', 'when the recognition of them is easy. Hence, the shortness of Saxon', 'words becomes a reason for their greater force. One qualification,', 'however, must not be overlooked. A word which in itself embodies the', 'most important part of the idea to be conveyed, especially when that', 'idea is an emotional one, may often with advantage be a polysyllabic', 'word. Thus it seems more forcible to say, ""It is _magnificent,_""', 'than ""It is _grand._"" The word _vast_ is not so powerful a one as', '_stupendous._ Calling a thing _nasty_ is not so effective as calling it', '_disgusting._', '', 'Â§ 7. There seem to be several causes for this exceptional superiority', 'of certain long words. We may ascribe it partly to the fact that a', 'voluminous, mouth-filling epithet is, by its very size, suggestive of', 'largeness or strength; witness the immense pomposity of sesquipedalian', 'verbiage: and when great power or intensity has to be suggested, this', 'association of ideas aids the effect. A further cause may be that a', 'word of several syllables admits of more emphatic articulation; and as', 'emphatic articulation is a sign of emotion, the unusual impressiveness', 'of the thing named is implied by it. Yet another cause is that a long', 'word (of which the latter syllables are generally inferred as soon as', ""the first are spoken) allows the hearer's consciousness a longer time to"", 'dwell upon the quality predicated; and where, as in the above cases, it', 'is to this predicated quality that the entire attention is called, an', 'advantage results from keeping it before the mind for an appreciable', 'time. The reasons which we have given for preferring short words', 'evidently do not hold here. So that to make our generalization quite', 'correct we must say, that while in certain sentences expressing strong', 'feeling, the word which more especially implies that feeling may often', 'with advantage be a many-syllabled or Latin one; in the immense majority', 'of cases, each word serving but as a step to the idea embodied by the', 'whole sentence, should, if possible, be a one-syllabled or Saxon one.', '', 'Â§ 8. Once more, that frequent cause of strength in Saxon and other', 'primitive words-their imitative character may be similarly resolved into', 'the more general cause. Both those directly imitative, as _splash, bang,', 'whiz, roar,_ &c., and those analogically imitative, as _rough, smooth,', 'keen, blunt, thin, hard, crag,_ &c., have a greater or less likeness to', 'the things symbolized; and by making on the senses impressions allied to', 'the ideas to be called up, they save part of the effort needed to call', 'up such ideas, and leave more attention for the ideas themselves.', '', ""Â§ 9. The economy of the recipient's mental energy, into which are thus"", 'resolvable the several causes of the strength of Saxon English, may', 'equally be traced in the superiority of specific over generic words.', 'That concrete terms produce more vivid impressions than abstract ones,', 'and should, when possi']"

On her left, yet slightly drawn back, so as to', 'evince a less decided support, is Cotton, no young and hot enthusiast,', 'but a mild, grave man in the decline of life, deep in all the learning', 'of the age, and sanctified in heart, and made venerable in feature, by', 'the long exercise of his holy profession.  He, also, is deceived by the', 'strange fire now laid upon the altar; and he alone among his brethren is', 'excepted in the denunciation of the new apostle, as sealed and set apart', 'by Heaven to the work of the ministry.  Others of the priesthood stand', 'full in front of the woman, striving to beat her down with brows of', 'wrinkled iron, and whispering sternly and significantly among themselves', 'as she unfolds her seditious doctrines, and grows warm in their support.', 'Foremost is Hugh Peters, full of holy wrath, and scarce containing', 'himself from rushing forward to convict her of damnable heresies.', 'There, also, is Ward, meditating a reply of empty puns, and quaint', 'antitheses, and tinkling jests that puzzle us with nothing but a sound.', 'The audience are variously affected; but none are indifferent.

A great many', 'people, too, go there in the winter to avoid the cold weather which', 'prevails at that time of the year, in all the more northerly countries', 'of Europe.', '', 'There is so little winter in Florence that few of the houses have any', 'fireplaces in them except in the kitchen. When there comes a cold day,', 'the people warm themselves by means of a jug or jar of earthen ware,', 'with a handle passing over across the top, by which they carry it about.', 'They fill these jars half full of hot embers, and so carry them with', 'them wherever they want to go. The women, when they sit down, put the', 'jar under their dresses on the floor or pavement beneath them, and the', 'men place it right before them between their feet.', '', 'You will see market women and flower girls sitting in the corners of the', 'streets in the winter, attending to their business, and keeping', 'themselves warm all the time with these little fire jars; and artists', 'in the palaces and picture galleries, each with one of them by his side,', 'or close before him, while he is at work copying the works of the great', 'masters, or making drawings from the antique statues.', '', 'There is another very curious use that the people of Florence make of', 'these jars; and that is they warm the beds with them when any body is', 'sick, so as to require this indulgence. You would think it very', 'difficult to warm a bed with an open jar filled with burning embers. The', 'way they do it is this: they hang the jar in the inside of a sort of', 'wooden cage, shaped like a bushel basket, and about as large. They turn', 'this cage upside down, and hang the jar up in it by means of a hook', 'depending inside. They turn down the bed clothes and put the cage in it,', 'jar of coals and all. They then put back the bed clothes, and cover the', 'cage all up. They leave it so for a quarter of an hour, and then,', 'carefully turning the clothes down again, they take the jar out, and the', 'bed is warmed.', '', 'But to return to Mr. George and Rollo. They engaged a vetturino for the', 'first time at Florence. Mr. George had gone to Florence chiefly for the', 'purpose of examining the immense collections of paintings and statuary', 'which exist there. Rollo went, not on account of the paintings or', 'statues,--for he did not care much about such things,--but because he', 'liked to go any where where he could see new places, and be entertained', 'by new scenes. Accordingly, while Mr. George was at work in the', 'galleries of Florence, studying, by the help of catalogues, the famous', 'specimens of ancient art, Rollo was usually rambling about the streets,', 'observing the manners and customs of the people, and watching the', 'singular and curious scenes that every where met his eye.', '', 'The reason why there are so many paintings and sculptures in Italy is', 'this: in the middle ages, it was the fashion, in all the central parts', 'of Europe, for the people to spend almost all their surplus money in', 'building and decorating churches. Indeed, there was then very little', 'else that they could do. At the present time, people invest their funds,', 'as fast as they accumulate them, in building ships and railroads, docks', 'for the storage of merchandise, houses and stores in cities, to let for', 'the sake of the rent, and country seats, or pretty private residences of', 'various kinds, for themselves. But in the middle ages very little could', 'be done in the way of investments like these. There were no railroads,', 'and there was very little use for ships. There was no profit to be', 'gained by building houses and stores, for there were so many wars and', 'commotions among the people of the different towns and kingdoms, that', 'nothing was stable or safe. For the same reason it was useless for men', 'to spend their money in building and ornamenting their own houses, for', 'at the first approach of an enemy, the town in which they lived was', 'likely to be sacked, and their houses, and all the fine furniture which', 'they might contain, would be burned or destroyed.', '', 'But the churches were safe. The people of the different countries had so', 'much veneration for sacred places, and for every thing connected with', 'religion, that they were afraid to touch or injure any thing that had', 'been consecrated to a religious use. To plunder a church, or a convent,', 'or an abbey, or to do any thing to injure or destroy the property that', 'they contained, was regarded as _sacrilege_; and sacrilege they deemed a', 'dreadful crime, abhorred by God and man. Thus, while they would burn and', 'destroy hundreds of dwellings without any remorse, and turn the wretched', 'inmates out at midnight into the streets to die of exposure, terror, and', 'despair, they would stop at once when they came to the church, afraid to', 'harm it in any way, or to touch the least thing that it contained.', 'Accordingly, while every thing else in a conquered town was doomed to', 'the most reckless destruction, all that was in the church,--the most', 'delicate paintings, and the most costly gold and silver images and', 'utensils--were as safe as if they were surrounded by impregnable castle', 'walls.', '', 'Of course these notions were very mistaken ones. According to the', 'teachings of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, it must be a greater sin', 'to burn down the cottage of a poor widow, and turn her out at midnight', 'into the streets to die, than to plunder for gain the richest altar in', 'the world.', '', 'From these and various other similar causes, it happened that, in the', 'middle ages,--that is, from five hundred to a thousand years', 'ago,--almost all the great expenditures of money, in all the great', 'cities and towns of Europe, were made for churches.

Throughout a', ""long-drawn summer's day would this man talk to you in low, equable, but"", 'clear and musical, tones, concerning things human and divine; marshalling', 'all history, harmonizing all experiment, probing the depths of your', 'consciousness, and revealing visions of glory and of terror to the', 'imagination; but pouring withal such floods of light upon the mind, that', 'you might, for a season, like Paul, become blind in the very act of', 'conversion. And this he would do, without so much as one allusion to', 'himself, without a word of reflection on others, save when any given act', 'fell naturally in the way of his discourse,--without one anecdote that was', 'not proof and illustration of a previous position;--gratifying no passion,', 'indulging no caprice, but, with a calm mastery over your soul, leading you', 'onward and onward for ever through a thousand windings, yet with no pause,', 'to some magnificent point in which, as in a focus, all the party-coloured', 'rays of his discourse should converge in light.

He says, _I have,_ not _I possess_---_I wish,_', 'not I _desire;_ he does not _reflect,_ he _thinks;_ he does not beg', 'for _amusement,_ but for _play_; he calls things _nice_ or _nasty,_', 'not _pleasant_ or _disagreeable._ The synonyms which he learns in after', 'years, never become so closely, so organically connected with the ideas', 'signified, as do these original words used in childhood; and hence the', 'association remains less strong. But in what does a strong association', 'between a word and an idea differ from a weak one? Simply in the greater', 'ease and rapidity of the suggestive action. It can be in nothing else.', 'Both of two words, if they be strictly synonymous, eventually call up', 'the same image. The expression--It is _acid,_ must in the end give rise', 'to the same thought as--It is sour; but because the term _acid_ was', 'learnt later in life, and has not been so often followed by the thought', 'symbolized, it does not so readily arouse that thought as the term sour.', 'If we remember how slowly and with what labour the appropriate ideas', 'follow unfamiliar words in another language, and how increasing', 'familiarity with such words brings greater rapidity and ease of', 'comprehension; and if we consider that the same process must have gone', 'on with the words of our mother tongue from childhood upwards, we shall', 'clearly see that the earliest learnt and oftenest used words, will,', 'other things equal, call up images with less loss of time and energy', 'than their later learnt synonyms.', '', 'Â§ 6. The further superiority possessed by Saxon English in its', 'comparative brevity, obviously comes under the same generalization. If', 'it be an advantage to express an idea in the smallest number of words,', 'then will it be an advantage to express it in the smallest number of', 'syllables. If circuitous phrases and needless expletives distract the', 'attention and diminish the strength of the impression produced, then', 'do surplus articulations do so. A certain effort, though commonly', 'an inappreciable one, must be required to recognize every vowel and', 'consonant. If, as all know, it is tiresome to listen to an indistinct', 'speaker, or read a badly-written manuscript; and if, as we cannot doubt,', 'the fatigue is a cumulative result of the attention needed to catch', 'successive syllables; it follows that attention is in such cases', 'absorbed by each syllable. And if this be true when the syllables are', 'difficult of recognition, it will also be true, though in a less degree,', 'when the recognition of them is easy. Hence, the shortness of Saxon', 'words becomes a reason for their greater force. One qualification,', 'however, must not be overlooked. A word which in itself embodies the', 'most important part of the idea to be conveyed, especially when that', 'idea is an emotional one, may often with advantage be a polysyllabic', 'word. Thus it seems more forcible to say, ""It is _magnificent,_""', 'than ""It is _grand._"" The word _vast_ is not so powerful a one as', '_stupendous._ Calling a thing _nasty_ is not so effective as calling it', '_disgusting._', '', 'Â§ 7. There seem to be several causes for this exceptional superiority', 'of certain long words. We may ascribe it partly to the fact that a', 'voluminous, mouth-filling epithet is, by its very size, suggestive of', 'largeness or strength; witness the immense pomposity of sesquipedalian', 'verbiage: and when great power or intensity has to be suggested, this', 'association of ideas aids the effect. A further cause may be that a', 'word of several syllables admits of more emphatic articulation; and as', 'emphatic articulation is a sign of emotion, the unusual impressiveness', 'of the thing named is implied by it. Yet another cause is that a long', 'word (of which the latter syllables are generally inferred as soon as', ""the first are spoken) allows the hearer's consciousness a longer time to"", 'dwell upon the quality predicated; and where, as in the above cases, it', 'is to this predicated quality that the entire attention is called, an', 'advantage results from keeping it before the mind for an appreciable', 'time. The reasons which we have given for preferring short words', 'evidently do not hold here. So that to make our generalization quite', 'correct we must say, that while in certain sentences expressing strong', 'feeling, the word which more especially implies that feeling may often', 'with advantage be a many-syllabled or Latin one; in the immense majority', 'of cases, each word serving but as a step to the idea embodied by the', 'whole sentence, should, if possible, be a one-syllabled or Saxon one.', '', 'Â§ 8. Once more, that frequent cause of strength in Saxon and other', 'primitive words-their imitative character may be similarly resolved into', 'the more general cause. Both those directly imitative, as _splash, bang,', 'whiz, roar,_ &c., and those analogically imitative, as _rough, smooth,', 'keen, blunt, thin, hard, crag,_ &c., have a greater or less likeness to', 'the things symbolized; and by making on the senses impressions allied to', 'the ideas to be called up, they save part of the effort needed to call', 'up such ideas, and leave more attention for the ideas themselves.', '', ""Â§ 9. The economy of the recipient's mental energy, into which are thus"", 'resolvable the several causes of the strength of Saxon English, may', 'equally be traced in the superiority of specific over generic words.', 'That concrete terms produce more vivid impressions than abstract ones,', 'and should, when possi']"

It was a dark little tale about a man who found a magic cup and learned that if he wept into the cup, his tears turned into pearls. But even though he had always been poor, he was a happy man and rarely shed a tear. So he found ways to make himself sad so that his tears could make him rich. As the pearls piled up, so did his greed grow. The story ended with the man sitting on a mountain of pearls, knife in hand, weeping helplessly into the cup with his beloved wife's slain body in his arms"
1,2001,Life of pi,5,"I know a woman here in Toronto who is very dear to my heart. She was my foster mother. I call her Auntieji and she likes that. She is Quebecoise. Though she has lived in Toronto for over thirty years, her French-speaking mind still slips on occasion on the understanding of English sounds. And so, when she first heard of Hare Krishnas, she didn't hear right. She heard ""Hairless Christians"", and that is what they were to her for many years. When I corrected her, I told her that in fact she was not so wrong; that Hindus, in their capacity for love, are indeed hairless Christians, just as Muslims, in the way they see God in everything, are bearded Hindus, and Christians, in their devotion to God, are hat-wearing Muslims."
2,2003,The da vinci code,5,"Sophie stopped the taxi at an imposing gate that blocked the bank’s driveway—a cement-lined ramp that descended beneath the building. A video camera overhead was aimed directly at them, and Langdon had the feeling that this camera, unlike those at the Louvre, was authentic. Sophie rolled down the window and surveyed the electronic podium on the driver’s side. An LCD screen provided directions in seven languages. Topping the list was English."
3,2003,The curious incident of the dog in the night,5,"A lie is when you say something happened which didn't happen. But there is only ever one thing which happened at a particular time and a particular place. And there are an infinite number of things which didn't happen at that time and that place. And if I think about something which didn't happen I start thinking about all the other things which didn't happen.
For example, this morning for breakfast I had Ready Brek and some hot raspberry milkshake. But if I say that I actually had Shreddies and a mug of tea I start thinking about Coco-Pops and lemonade and Porridge and Dr Pepper and how I wasn't eating my breakfast in Egypt and there wasn't a rhinoceros in the room and Father wasn't wearing a diving suit and so on and even writing this makes me feel shaky and scared, like I do when I'm standing on the top of a very tall building and there are thousands of houses and cars and people below me and my head is so full of all these things that I'm afraid that I'm going to forget to stand up straight and hang onto the rail and I'm going to fall over and be killed."

He curled me into a ball against his chest, holding me more securely than iron chains. I glared at him in alarm, but he seemed well in control, his jaw relaxed as he grinned, his eyes bright only with humor."
5,2001,Atonement,5,"Now and then, an inch below the water's surface, the muscles of his stomach tightened involuntarily as he recalled another detail. A drop of water on her upper arm. Wet. An embroidered flower, a simple daisy, sewn between the cups of her bra. Her breasts wide apart and small. On her back, a mole half covered by a strap. When she climbed out of the pond a glimpse of the triangular darkness her knickers were supposed to conceal. Wet. He saw it, he made himself see it again. The way her pelvic bones stretched the material clear of the skin, the deep curve of her waist, her startling whiteness. When she reached for her skirt, a carelessly raised foot revealed a patch of soil on each pad of her sweetly diminished toes. Another mole the size of a farthing on her thigh and something purplish on her calf--a strawberry mark, a scar. Not blemishes. Adornments."
6,2005,never let me go,5,"That was the only time, as I stood there, looking at that strange rubbish, feeling the wind coming across those empty fields, that I started to imagine just a little fantasy thing, because this was Norfolk after all, and it was only a couple of weeks since I’d lost him. I was thinking about the rubbish, the flapping plastic in the branches, the shore-line of odd stuff caught along the fencing, and I half-closed my eyes and imagined this was the spot where everything I'd ever lost since my childhood had washed up, and I was now standing here in front of it, and if I waited long enough, a tiny figure would appear on the horizon across the field, and gradually get larger until I'd see it was Tommy, and he'd wave, maybe even call. The fantasy never got beyond that --I didn't let it-- and though the tears rolled down my face, I wasn't sobbing or out of control. I just waited a bit, then turned back to the car, to drive off to wherever it was I was supposed to be."

Or: ""the disappointment of sleeping with one's fantasy."" I'd like to show how ""intimations of mortality brought on by aging family members"" connects with ""the hatred of mirrors that begins in middle age."" I'd like to have a word for ""the sadness inspired by failing restaurants"" as well as for ""the excitement of getting a room with a minibar.""

9,1999,the white teeth ,5,"It's a funny thing about the modern world. You hear girls in the toilets of clubs saying, ""Yeah, he fucked off and left me. He didn't love me. He just couldn't deal with love. He was too fucked up to know how to love me."" Now, how did that happen? What was it about this unlovable century that convinced us we were, despite everything, eminently lovable as a people, as a species? What made us think that anyone who fails to love us is damaged, lacking, malfunctioning in some way? And particularly if they replace us with a god, or a weeping madonna, or the face of Christ in a ciabatta roll---then we call them crazy. Deluded. Regressive. We are so convinced of the goodness of ourselves, and the goodness of our love, we cannot bear to believe that there might be something more worthy of love than us, more worthy of worship. Greeting cards routinely tell us everybody deserves love. No. Everybody deserves clean water. Not everybody deserves love all the time."

And when we do find each other again, we’ll cling together so tight that nothing and no one’ll ever tear us apart. Every atom of me and every atom of you… We’ll live in birds and flowers and dragonflies and pine trees and in clouds and in those little specks of light you see floating in sunbeams… And when they use our atoms to make new lives, they won’t just be able to take one, they’ll have to take two, one of you and one of me, we’ll be joined so tight…"
11,2003,a sorty history,5,"Thanks to ten minutes or so of balmy weather, by 10:24 the Earth is covered in the great carboniferous forests whose residues give us all our coal, and the first winged insects are evident. Dinosaurs plod onto the scene just before 11 P.M. and hold sway for about three-quarters of an hour. At twenty-one minutes to midnight they vanish and the age of mammals begins. Humans emerge one minute and seventeen seconds before midnight. The whole of our recorded history, on this scale, would be no more than a few seconds, a single human lifetime barely an instant. Throughout this greatly speeded-up day continents slide about and bang together at a clip that seems positively reckless. Mountains rise and melt away, ocean basins come and go, ice sheets advance and withdraw. And throughout the whole, about three times every minute, somewhere on the planet there is a flash-bulb pop of light marking the impact of a Manson-sized meteor or one even larger. It's a wonder that anything at all can survive in such a pummeled and unsettled environment. In fact, not many things do for long"
12,2008,the white tiger,5,"Me, and thousands of others in this country like me, are half-baked, because we were never allowed to complete our schooling. Open our skulls, look in with a penlight, and you'll find an odd museum of ideas: sentences of history or mathematics remembered from school textbooks (no boy remembers his schooling like the one who was taken out of school, let me assure you), sentences about politics read in a newspaper while waiting for someone to come to an office, triangles and pyramids seen on the torn pages of the old geometry textbooks which every tea shop in this country uses to wrap its snacks in, bits of All India Radio news bulletins, things that drop into your mind, like lizards from the ceiling, in the half hour before falling asleep--all these ideas, half formed and half digested and half correct, mix up with other half-cooked ideas in your head, and I guess these half-formed ideas bugger one another, and make more half-formed ideas, and this is what you act on and live with."
13,2004,cloud atlas,5,"Belief, like fear or love, is a force to be understood as we understand the theory of relativity and principals of uncertainty. Phenomena that determine the course of our lives. Yesterday, my life was headed in one direction. Today, it is headed in another. Yesterday, I believe I would never have done what I did today. These forces that often remake time and space, that can shape and alter who we imagine ourselves to be, begin long before we are born and continue after we perish. Our lives and our choices, like quantum trajectories, are understood moment to moment. That each point of intersection, each encounter, suggest a new potential direction. Proposition, I have fallen in love with Luisa Rey. Is this possible? I just met her and yet, I feel like something important has happened to me."
14,2006,the god delision,5,"Let us remind ourselves of the terminology. A theist believes in a supernatural intelligence who, in addition to his main work of creating the universe in the first place, is still around to oversee and influence the subsequent fate of his initial creation. In many theistic belief systems, the deity is intimately involved in human affairs. He answers prayers; forgives or punishes sins; intervenes in the world by performing miracles; frets about good and bad deeds, and knows when we do them (or even think about doing them). A deist, too, believes in a supernatural intelligence, but one whose activities were confined to setting up the laws that govern the universe in the first place. The deist God never intervenes thereafter, and certainly has no specific interest in human affairs. Pantheists don't believe in a supernatural God at all, but use the word God as a non-supernatural synonym for Nature, or for the Universe, or for the lawfulness that governs its workings. Deists differ from theists in that their God does not answer prayers, is not interested in sins or confessions, does not read our thoughts and does not intervene with capricious miracles. Deists differ from pantheists in that the deist God is some kind of cosmic intelligence, rather than the pantheist's metaphoric or poetic synonym for the laws of the universe. Pantheism is sexed-up atheism. Deism is watered-down theism."
15,1993,the giver,5,"Lily appeared, wearing her nightclothes, in the doorway. She gave an impatient sigh. 'This is certainly a very LONG private conversation,' she said. 'And there are certain people waiting for their comfort object.' Lily,' her mother said fondly, 'you're very close to being an Eight, and when you're an Eight, your comfort object will be taken away. It will be recycled to the younger children. You should be starting to go off to sleep without it.' But her father had already gone to the shelf and taken down the stuffed elephant which was kept there. Many of the comfort objects, like Lily's, were soft, stuffed, imaginary creatures. Jonas's had been called a bear. Here you are, Lily-billy,' he said. 'I'll come help you remove your hair ribbons."
16,1997,memoirsa of a geisha,5,"To the eyes of the American soldiers who drove past, I looked no different from the women around me; and as I thought of it, who could say I was any different? If you no longer have leaves, or bark, or roots, can you go on calling yourself a tree? ""I am a peasant,"" I said to myself, ""and not a geisha at all any longer."" It was a frightening feeling to look at my hands and see their roughness. To draw my mind away from my fears, I turned my attention again to the truckloads of soldiers driving past. Weren't these the very American soldiers we'd been taught to hate, who had bombed our cities with such horrifying weapons? Now they rode through our neighborhood, throwing pieces of candy to the children."
17,1995,the golden compass,5,"You are so young, Lyra, too young to understand this, but I shall tell you anyway and you'll understand it later: men pass in front of our eyes like butterflies, creatures of a brief season. We love them; they are brave, proud, beautiful, clever; and they die almost at once. They die so soon that our hearts are continually racked with pain. We bear their children, who are witches if they are female, human if not; and then in the blink of an eye they are gone, felled, slain, lost. Our sons, too. When a little boy is growing, he thinks he is immortal. His mother knows he isn't. Each time becomes more painful, until finally your heart is broken. Perhaps that is when Yambe-Akka comes for you. She is older than the tundra. Perhaps, for her, witches' lives are as brief as men's are to us."
18,1998,the poison wood bible,5,"But his kind will always lose in the end. I know this, and now I know why. Whether it's wife or nation they occupy, their mistake is the same: they stand still, and their stake moves underneath them.... Chains rattle, rivers roll, animals startle and bolt, forests inspire and expand, babies stretch open-mouthed from the womb, new seedlings arch their necks and creep forward into the light. Even a language won't stand still. A territory is only possessed for a moment in time. They stake everything on that moment, posing for photographs while planting the flag, casting themselves in bronze.... Even before the flagpole begins to peel and splinter, the ground underneath arches and slides forward into its own new destiny. It may bear the marks of boots on its back, but those marks become the possessions of the land."
19,1999,the perks of being a wallflower,5,"It's much easier to not know things sometimes. Things change and friends leave. And life doesn't stop for anybody. I wanted to laugh. Or maybe get mad. Or maybe shrug at how strange everybody was, especially me. I think the idea is that every person has to live for his or her own life and than make the choice to share it with other people. You can't just sit their and put everybody's lives ahead of yours and think that counts as love. You just can't. You have to do things. I'm going to do what I want to do. I'm going to be who I really am. And I'm going to figure out what that is. And we could all sit around and wonder and feel bad about each other and blame a lot of people for what they did or didn't do or what they didn't know. I don't know. I guess there could always be someone to blame. It's just different. Maybe it's good to put things in perspective, but sometimes, I think that the only perspective is to really be there. Because it's okay to feel things. I was really there. And that was enough to make me feel infinite. I feel infinite."

Stanley turned to see Mr. Sir holding the boy’s head against the oatmeal pot. “Is something wrong with my face?” The boy tried to speak but couldn’t. Mr. Sir had him by the throat. “Does anyone see anything wrong with my face?” asked Mr. Sir, as he continued to choke the boy. Nobody said anything. Mr. Sir let the boy go. His head banged against the table as he fell to the ground. Mr. Sir stood over him and asked, “How does my face look to you now?” A gurgling sound came out of the boy’s mouth, then he managed to gasp the word, “Fine.” “I’m kind of handsome, don’t you think?” “Yes, Mr. Sir.” Out"
21,1996,angelas ashes,5,"Anytime Jesus got hungry all He had to do was go up the road to a fig tree or an orange tree and have His fill. If He wanted a pint He could wave His hand over a big glass and there was the pint. Or He could visit Mary Magdalene and her sister, Martha, and they'd give Him His dinner no questions asked and He'd get his feet washed and dried with Mary Magdalene's hair while Martha washed the dishes, which I don't think is fair. Why should she have to wash the dishes while her sister sits out there chatting away with Our Lord? It's a good thing Jesus decided to be born Jewish in that warm place because if he was born in Limerick he'd catch the consumption and be dead in a month and there wouldn't be any Catholic Church and there wouldn't be any Communion or Confirmation and we wouldn't have to learn the catechism and write compositions about Him."
22,1996,fight club,5,"You have a class of young strong men and women, and they want to give their lives to something. Advertising has these people chasing cars and clothes they don't need. Generations have been working in jobs they hate, just so they can buy what they don't really need. We don't have a great war in our generation, or a great depression, but we do, we have a great war of the spirit. We have a great revolution against the culture. The great depression is our lives. We have a spiritual depression"
23,1999,girl with a pearl earring,5,"I had not yet been down to the cellar where I was to sleep. I took a candle with me but was too tired to look around beyond finding a bed, pillow and blanket. Leaving the trap door of the cellar open so that cool, fresh air could reach me, I took off my shoes, cap, apron and dress, prayed briefly, and lay down. I was about to blow out the candle when I noticed the painting hanging at the foot of my bed. I sat up, wide awake now. It was another picture of Christ on the Cross, smaller than the one upstairs but even more disturbing. Christ had thrown his head back in pain, and Mary Magdalene’s eyes were rolling. I Iay back gingerly, unable to take my eyes off it. I could not imagine sleeping in the room with the painting. I wanted to take it down but did not dare. Finally I blew out the candle—I could not afford to waste candles on my first day in the new house. I lay back again, my eyes fixed to the place where I knew the painting hung. I slept badly that night, tired as I was. I woke often and looked for the painting. Though I could see nothing on the wall, every detail was fixed in my mind. Finally, when it was beginning to grow light, the painting appeared again and I was sure the Virgin Mary was looking down at me."
24,1996,bridget jones diary,5,"Being a woman is worse than being a farmer there is so much harvesting and crop spraying to be done: legs to be waxed, underarms shaved, eyebrows plucked, feet pumiced, skin exfoliated and moisturised, spots cleansed, roots dyed, eyelashes tinted, nails filed, cellulite massaged, stomach muscles exercised. The whole performance is so highly tuned you only need to neglect it for a few days for the whole thing to go to seed. Sometimes I wonder what I would be like if left to revert to nature — with a full beard and handlebar moustache on each shin Dennis Healey eyebrows face a graveyard of dead skin cells spots erupting long curly fingernails like Struwelpeter blind as bat and stupid runt of species as no contact lenses flabby body flobbering around. Ugh ugh. Is it any wonder girl"
25,1992,the secret history,5,"ery Greek idea, and a very profound one. Beauty is terror. Whatever we call beautiful, we quiver before it. And what could be more terrifying and beautiful, to souls like the Greeks or our own, than to lose control completely? To throw off the chains of being for an instant, to shatter the accident of our mortal selves? Euripides speaks of the Maenads: head thrown I back, throat to the stars, ""more like deer than human being."" To be absolutely free! One is quite capable, of course, of working out these destructive passions in more vulgar and less efficient ways. But how glorious to release them in a single burst! To sing, to scream, to dance barefoot in the woods in the dead of night, with no more awareness of mortality than an animal! These are powerful mysteries. The bellowing of bulls. Springs of honey bubbling from the ground. If we are strong enough in our souls we can rip away the veil and look that naked, terrible beauty right in the face; let God consume us, devour us, unstring our bones. Then spit us out reborn"
26,1990,jurassic park,5,"But now science is the belief system that is hundreds of years old. And, like the medieval system before it, science is starting not to fit the world any more. Science has attained so much power that its practical limits begin to be apparent. Largely through science, billions of us live in one small world, densely packed and intercommunicating. But science cannot help us decide what to do with that world, or how to live. Science can make a nuclear reactor, but it cannot tell us not to build it. Science can make pesticide, but cannot tell us not to use it. And our world starts to seem polluted in fundamental ways---air, and water, and land---because of ungovernable science"

You’ll have no wife, nor will you ever hold a child of your own blood in your arms. Robb will rule, you will serve. Men will call you a crow. Him they’ll call `Your Grace’.

Because he rather liked people. It was major failing in a demon. Oh, he did his best to make their short lives miserable, because that was his job, but nothing he could think up was half as bad as the stuff they thought up themselves. They seemed to have a talent for it. It was built into the design, somehow. They were born into a world that was against them in a thousand little ways, and then devoted most of their energies to making it worse. Over the years Crowley had found it increasingly difficult to find anything demonic to do which showed up against the natural background of generalized nastiness. There had been times, over the past millennium, when he’d felt like sending a message back Below saying, Look we may as well give up right now, we might as well shut down Dis and Pandemonium and everywhere and move up here, there’s nothing we can do to them that they don’t do to themselves and they do things we’ve never even thought of, often involving electrodes.

To children, the world and everything in it is new, something that gives rise to astonishment. It is not like that for adults. Most adults accept the world as a matter of course. This is precisely where philosophers are a notable exception. A philosopher never gets quite used to the world. To him or her, the world continues to seem a bit unreasonable - bewildering, even enigmatic. Philosophers and small children thus have an important faculty in common. The only thing we require to be good philosophers is the faculty of won"

Sorrow, lord. Feeling like shit. It? I ask. Yeah, It. God ain't a he or a she, but a It. But what do it look like? I ask. Don't look like nothing, she say. It ain't a picture show.

We believed in it, this downward motion: so lovely, like flying, and yet at the same time so dire, so extreme, so unlikely. God is love, they once said, but we reversed that, and love, like heaven, was always just around the corner. The more difficult it was to love the particular man beside us, the more we believed in Love, abstract and total. We were waiting, always, for the incarnation. That word, made flesh. And sometimes it happened, for a time. That kind of love comes and goes and is hard to remember afterwards, like pain. You would look at the man one day and you would think, I loved you, and the tense would be past, and you would be filled with a sense of wonder, because it was such an amazing and precarious and dumb thing to have done; and you would know too why your friends had been evasive about it, at the time"
32,1983,pet semeatary,5,"t's probably wrong to believe there can be any limit to the horror which the human mind can experience. On the contrary, it seems that some exponential effect begins to obtain as deeper and deeper darkness falls-as little as one may like to admit it, human experience tends, in a good many ways, to support the idea that when the nightmare grows black enough, horror spawns horror, one coincidental evil begets other, often more deliberate evils, until finally blackness seems to cover everything. And the most terrifying question of all may be just how much horror the human mind can stand and still maintain a wakeful, staring, unrelenting sanity. That such events have their own Rube Goldberg absurdity goes almost without saying. At some point, it all starts to become rather funny. That may be the point at which sanity begins either to save itself or to buckle and break down; that point at which one's sense of humor begins to reassert its"

The Antichrist can be born from piety itself, from excessive love of God or of the truth, as the heretic is born from the saint and the possessed from the seer. Fear prophets, Adso, and those prepared to die for the truth, for as a rule they make many others die with them, often before them, at times instead of them. Jorge did a diabolical thing because he loved his truth so lewdly that he dared anything in order to destroy falsehood"
34,1981,midnights children,5,"One Kashmiri morning in the early spring of 1915, my grandfather Aadam Aziz hit his nose against a frost-hardened tussock of earth while attempting to pray. Three drops of blood plopped out of his left nostril, hardened instantly in the brittle air and lay before his eyes on the prayer-mat, transformed into rubies. Lurching back until he knelt with his head once more upright, he found that the tears which had sprung to his eyes had solidified, too; and at that moment, as he brushed diamonds contemptuously from his lashes, he resolved never again to kiss earth for any god or man. This decision, however, made a hole in him, a vacancy in a vital inner chamber, leaving him vulnerable to women and history. Unaware of this at first, despite his recently completed medical training, he stood up, rolled the prayer-mat into a thick cheroot, and holding it under his right arm surveyed the valley through clear, diamond-free eyes"

Those they only use, tie, bind, chop off and leave empty. Love your hands! Love them. Raise them up and kiss them. Touch others with them, pat them together, stroke them on your face 'cause they don't love that either. You got to love it, you! And no, they ain't in love with your mouth. Yonder, out there, they will see it broken and break it again. What you say out of it they will not heed. What you scream from it they do not hear. What you put into it to nourish your body they will snatch away and give you leavins instead. No, they don't love your mouth. You got to love it. This is flesh I'm talking about here. Flesh that needs to be loved. Feet that need to rest and to dance; backs that need support; shoulders that need arms, strong arms I'm telling you. And O my people, out yonder, hear me, they do not love your neck unnoosed and straight. So love your neck; put a hand on it, grace it, stroke it and hold it up. and all your inside parts that they'd just as soon slop for hogs, you got to love them. The dark, dark liver--love it, love it and the beat and beating heart, love that too. More than eyes or feet. More than lungs that have yet to draw free air.

I know this, because I was raised the Chinese way: I was taught to desire nothing, to swallow other people's misery, to eat my own bitterness. and even though I taught my daughter the opposite, she still came out the same way! Maybe it is because she was born to me and she was born a girl. And I was born to my mother and I was born a girl. All of us are like stairs, one step after another, going up and down, but all going the same way. I know how it is to be quiet, to listen and watch, as if your life were a dream.

But it's more than that, isn't it? The most important things lie too close to wherever your secret heart is buried, like landmarks to a treasure your enemies would love to steal away. And you may make revelations that cost you dearly only to have people look at you in a funny way, not understanding what you've said at all, or why you thought it was so important that you almost cried while you were saying it.

She dropped the tasting spoon and tried to run despite the invincible weight of her age, screaming like a madwoman without knowing yet what had happened under the mango leaves, and her heart jumped inside her ribs when she saw her man lying on his back in the mud, dead to this life but still resisting death's final blow for one last minute so that she would have time to come to him. He recognized her despite the uproar, through his tears of unrepeatable sorrow at dying without her, and he looked for her for the last and final time with eyes more luminous, more grief-stricken, more grateful that she had ever seen them in the half century of a shared life, and he managed to say to her with his last breath:"

After awhile it forgot the cerise color of the sun dying behind Kilimanjaro. After awhile it only knew the muddy, smogged-out sunsets of Boston, that was all it remembered and all it wanted to remember.

The deeper we delve into things, the looser our structure may seem to become. The family process works towards sealing off the world. Small errors grow heads, fictions proliferate. I tell Murray that ignorance and confusion can’t possibly be the driving forces behind family solidarity. What an idea, what a subversion. He asks me why the strongest family units exist in the least developed societies. Not to know is a weapon of survival, he says. Magic and superstition become entrenched as the powerful orthodoxy of the clan. The family is strongest where objective reality is most likely to be misinterpreted. What a heartless theory, I say.

One day early that June she shuffled out to the mailbox at the end of the driveway, leaning heavily on her Boston Post cane (which would go to Vin Marchant when the loudmouthed old bitch popped off, George Meara thought, and good riddance to you, Evvie) and smoking a Herbert Tareyton. She bellowed a greeting at Meara--her deafness had apparently convinced her that everyone else in the world had gone deaf in sympathy--and then shouted that they were going to have the hottest summer in thirty years. Hot early and hot late, Evvie bellowed leather-lunged into the drowsy eleven-o'clock quiet, and hot in the middle. ""That so?"" George asked. ""What?"" ""I said, 'Is that so?'

Had cars ever really gone that fast? ""Arnie, I think the engine block's cracked. I really do. This car is lunch, my friend. It's just total lunch.

48,1989,the remains of the dead,5,"ut what is the sense in forever speculating what might have happened had such and such a moment turned out differently? One could presumably drive oneself to distraction in this way. In any case, while it is all very well to talk of 'turning points', one can surely only recognize such moments in retrospect. Naturally, when one looks back to such instances today, they may indeed take the appearance of being crucial, precious moments in one's life; but of course, at the time, this was not the impression one had. Rather, it was as though one had available a never-ending number of days, months, years in which to sort out the vagaries of one's relationship with Miss Kenton; an infinite number of further opportunities in which to remedy the effect of this or that misunderstanding. There was surely nothing to indicate at the time that such evidently small incidents would render whole dreams forever irredeemable"

She was not quite tall enough to reach things around in the kitchen, but she kept a small box in the outhouse which she brought in and stood on in order to get whatever she wanted. Mostly it was hot chocolate she made, warming the milk in a saucepan on the stove before mixing it. Occasionally she made Bovril or Ovaltine. It was pleasant to take a hot drink up to her room and have it beside her as she sat in her silent room reading in the empty house in the afternoons. The books transported her into new worlds and introduced her to amazing people who lived exciting lives. She went to Africa with Ernest Hemingway and to India with Rudyard Kipling.

For now that they could not be together, they must be infinitely apart, and what had been sure and unshakable was now fragile and insubstantial; from the moment we are not together, Alai is a stranger, for he has a life now that will be no part of mine, and that means that when I see him we will not know each other"

Even from fifty feet away, in the darkness, he could tell. It was that deep worry that lives in the base of the skull of every resident of Park Avenue south of Ninety-sixth Street—a black youth, tall, rangy, wearing white sneakers. Now he was forty feet away, thirty-five. Sherman stared at him. Well, let him come! I’m not budging! It’s my territory! I’m not giving way for any street punks! The black youth suddenly made a ninety-degree turn and cut straight across the street to the sidewalk on the other side. The feeble yellow of a sodium-vapor streetlight reflected for an instant on his face as he checked Sherman out. He had crossed over! What a stroke of luck! Not once did it dawn on Sherman McCoy that what the boy had seen was a thirty-eight-year-old white man, soaking wet, dressed in some sort of military-looking raincoat full of straps and buckles, holding a violently lurching animal in his arms, staring, bug-eyed, and talking to himsel"

Respected, charming, hasn't produced a piece of work in ten years. He has a system, which he explained to me. First, he submits an outline for a biography to the Academy to be absolutely sure his approach is consistent with Party policy. A crucial first step, as you'll see later. Now, the person he studies is always an important figure - that is, someone from Moscow - hence Tomashevski must do his Russian research close to home for two years. But this historical character also traveled, yes, lived for some years in Paris or London; hence Tomashevski must do the same, apply for and receive permission for foreign residence. Four years have passed. The Academy and the Party are rubbing their hands in anticipation of this seminal study of the important figure by the eminent Tomashevski. And now Tomashevski must retire to the solitude of a dacha outside Moscow to tend his garden and creatively brood over his cartons of research. Two more years pass in seminal thought. And just as Tomashevski is about to commit himself to paper, he checks with the Academy again only to learn that Party policy has totally about-faced; his hero is a traitor, and with regrets all around, Tomashevski must sacrifice his years of labor for the greater good. Naturally, they are only too happy to urge Tomashevski to start a new pro"

On the other hand, the people whose business it is to ask why, the philosophers, have not been able to keep up with the advance of scientific theories. In the eighteenth century, philosophers considered the whole of human knowledge, including science, to be their field and discussed questions such as: Did the universe have a beginning? However, in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, science became too technical and mathematical for the philosophers, or anyone else except a few specialists. Philosophers reduced the scope of their inquiries so much that Wittgenstein, the most famous philosopher of this century, said, 'The sole remaining task for philosophy is the analysis of language.' What a comedown from the great tradition of philosophy from Aristotle to Kan"

He escaped from bank vaults, nailed-up barrels, sewn mailbags; he escaped from a zinc-lined Knabe piano case, a giant football, a galvanized iron boiler, a rolltop desk, a sausage skin. His escapes were mystifying because he never damaged or appeared to unlock what he escaped from. The screen was pulled away and there he stood disheveled but triumphant beside the inviolate container that was supposed to have contained him. He waved to the crowd. He escaped from a sealed milk can filled with water. He escaped from a Siberian exile van. From a Chinese torture crucifix. From a Hamburg penitentiary. From an English prison ship. From a Boston jail. He was chained to automobile tires, water wheels, cannon, and he escaped. He dove manacled from a bridge into the Mississippi, the Seine, the Mersey, and came up waving. He hung upside down and strait-jacketed from cranes, biplanes and the tops of buildings. He was dropped into the ocean padlocked in a diving suit fully weighted and not connected to an air supply, and he escaped. He was buried alive in a grave and could not escape, and had to be rescued.

But the meanness, the cynicism with which this dream is to be used. The Serpent that announces, ""The World is a closed thing, cyclical, resonant, eternally-returning,"" is to be delivered into a system whose only aim is to violate the Cycle. Taking and not giving back, demanding that ""productivity"" and ""earnings"" keep on increasing with time, the System removing from the rest of the World these vast quantities of energy to keep its own tiny desperate fraction showing a profit: and not only most of humanity—most of the World, animal, vegetable, and mineral, is laid waste in the process. The System may or may not understand that it's only buying time. And that time is an artificial resource to begin with, of no value to anyone or anything but the System, which must sooner or later crash to its death, when its addiction to energy has become more than the rest of the World can supply, dragging with it innocent souls all along the chain of life.

This was the reason Americans shot each other so often: It was a convenient literary device for ending short stories and books.

Because that was the way authors customarily treated bit-part players in their made-up tales. And so on.Once I understood what was making America such a dangerous, unhappy nation of people who had nothing to do with real life, I resolved to shun storytelling. I would write about life. Every person would be exactly as important as any other. All facts would also be given equal weightiness. Nothing would be left out. Let others bring order to chaos. I would bring chaos to order, instead, which I think I have done.

They drove off in a small green van. No one waved to them, she noticed, or even said goodbye. Next, her father left in his own car; lastly a blond, good-looking man and a short fat one in an enormous overcoat like a pony blanket made their way to a sports car parked under the beech trees. For a moment she really thought there must be something wrong with the fat one, he followed so slowly and so painfully. Then, seeing the handsome man hold the car door for him, he seemed to wake, and hurried forward with a lumpy skip. Unaccountably, this gesture upset her afresh.

Frail and transitory as is every part of it, restless and migratory as are its elements, still it abides. It is bound together by a law of permanence, and though it is ever dying, it is ever coming to life again. Dissolution does but give birth to fresh modes of organization, and one death is the parent of a thousand lives. Each hour, as it comes, is but a testimony how fleeting, yet how secure, how certain, is the great whole. It is like an image on the waters, which is ever the same, though the waters ever flow. The sun sinks to rise again; the day is swallowed up in the gloom of night, to be born out of it, as fresh as if it had never been quenched. Spring passes into summer, and through summer and autumn into winter, only the more surely, by its own ultimate return, to triumph over that grave towards which it resolutely hastened from its first hour. We mourn the blossoms of May because they are to wither; but we know that May is one day to have its revenge upon November, by the revolution of that solemn circle which never stops—which teaches us in our height of hope, ever to be sober, and in our depth of desolation, never to desp"

I planned to examine his contribution in my master essay. In his view the primacy of the ethical over the esthetic mode was necessary to restore the balance. But enough of that. In myself I could observe the following sources of tedium: 1) The lack of a personal connection with the external world. Earlier I noted that when I was riding through France in a train last spring I looked out of the window and thought that the veil of Maya was wearing thin. And why was this? I wasn’t seeing what was there but only what everyone sees under a common directive. By this is implied that our worldview has used up nature. The rule of this view is that I, a subject, see the phenomena, the world of objects. They, however, are not necessarily in themselves objects as modern rationality defines objects. For in spirit, says Steiner, a man can step out of himself and let things speak to him about themselves, to speak about what has meaning not for him alone but also for them.

Pneumoencephalography was a technique developed in 1919 for taking images of the brain, which floats in a sea of liquid. That fluid protects the brain from damage, but makes it very difficult to X-ray, since images taken through fluid are cloudy. Pneumoencephalography involved drilling holes into the skulls of research subjects, draining the fluid surrounding their brains, and pumping air or helium into the skull in place of the fluid to allow crisp X-rays of the brain through the skull. the side effects--crippling headaches, dizziness, seizures, vomiting--lasted until the body naturally refilled the skull with spinal fluid, which usually took two to three months. Because pneumoencephalography could cause permanent brain damage and paralysis, it was abandoned in the 1970s.

When my first pen pal, Tomoko, stopped writing me after three letters she was the one who laughed: You think someone's going to lose life writing to you? Of course I cried; I was eight and I had already planned that Tomoko and her family would adopt me. My mother of course saw clean into the marrow of those dreams, and laughed. I wouldn't write to you either, she said. She was that kind of mother: who makes you doubt yourself, who would wipe you out if you let her. But I'm not going to pretend either.

(Because they had to be quiet on the hunt.) Why do women communicate so well? (Because they had to call out to one another where the fruits and berries were.) Why can men never find things around the house? (Because they have a narrow field of vision, useful in tracking prey.) Why can women find things so easily? (Because in protecting the nest they were used to scanning a wide field.) Why can't women parallel-park? (Because low testosterone inhibits spatial ability.) Why won't men ask for directions?

I know this is all mere apparition compared to what awaits us, but it is only lovelier for that. There is a human beauty in it. And I can’t believe that, when we have all been changed and put on incorruptibility, we will forget our fantastic condition of mortality and impermanence, the great bright dream of procreating and perishing that meant the whole world to us. In eternity this world will be Troy, I believe, and all that has passed here will be the epic of the universe, the ballad they sing in the streets.

Arthur, High King of Britain, was Constantine's grandson. He married up to three women, all called Guinevere, and his tomb is at Glastonbury, but you must understand that he is not really dead, only waiting his time to come again. His blessed descendant, Prince Arthur of England, was born in the year 1486, eldest son of Henry, the first Tudor king. This Arthur married Katharine the princess of Aragon, died at fifteen and was buried in Worcester Cathedral. If he were alive now, he would be King of England. His younger brother Henry would likely be Archbishop of Canterbury, and would not (at least, we devoutly hope not) be in pursuit of a woman of whom the cardinal hears nothing good: a woman to whom, several years before the dukes walk in to despoil him, he will need to turn his attention; whose history, before ruin seizes hi"

In the end all anyone could ever do was sum up the unknown factors in the ridiculous phrase, ""The fortunes of the battle swayed this way and that,"" or some similarly feeble and useless cliché. All of us, even when we think we have noted every tiny detail, resort to set pieces which have already been staged often enough by others. We try to reproduce the reality, but the harder we try, the more we find the pictures that make up the stock-in-trade of the spectacle of history forcing themselves upon us: the fallen drummer by, the infantry man shown in the act of stabbing another, the horse's eye starting from its socket, the invulnerable Emperor surrounded by his generals, a moment frozen still amidst the turmoil of battle.

And then he said that he was reading Capote's Breakfast at Tiffany's. Leaving aside the fact that A Simple Heart and A Christmas Carol were stories, not books, there was something revelatory about the taste of this bookish young pharmacist, who ... clearly and inarguably preferred minor works to major ones. He chose The Metamorphosis over The Trial, he chose Bartleby over Moby Dick, he chose A Simple Heart over Bouvard and Pecouchet, and A Christmas Carol over A Tale of Two Cities or The Pickwick Papers. What a sad paradox, thought Amalfitano. Now even bookish pharmacists are afraid to take on the great, imperfect, torrential works, books that blaze a path into the unknown. They choose the perfect exercises of the great masters. Or what amounts to the same thing: they want to watch the great masters spar, but they have no interest in real combat, when the great masters struggle against that something, that something that terrifies us all, that something that cows us and spurs us on, amid blood and mortal wounds and sten"

87,1969,slaughter house five,5,"ugh America is a nation of poor. Every other nation has folk traditions of men who were poor but extremely wise and virtuous, and therefore more estimable than anyone with power and gold. No such tales are told by the American poor. They mock themselves and glorify their betters. The meanest eating or drinking establishment, owned by a man who is himself poor, is very likely to have a sign on its wall asking this cruel question: 'if you’re so smart, why ain’t you rich?' There will also be an American flag no larger than a child’s hand – glued to a lollipop stick and flying from the cash register. Americans, like human beings everywhere, believe many things that are obviously untrue. Their most destructive untruth is that it is very easy for any American to make money. They will not acknowledge how in fact hard money is to come by, and, therefore, those who have no money blame and blame and blame themselves. This inward blame has been a treasure for the rich and powerful, who have had to do less for their poor, publicly and privately, than any other ruling class since, say Napoleonic times. Many novelties have come from America. The most startling of these, a thing without precedent, is a mas"

When a man showed up you didn’t want to look at his face and he didn’t want to look at yours, because it’s painful to see somebody so clear that it’s like looking inside him, but then neither did you want to look away and lose him completely.

You exist in a half-world suspended between two superstructures, one self-expression and the other self-destruction. You are strong, but there is a flaw in your strength, and unless you learn to control it the flaw will prove stronger than your strength and defeat you. The flaw? Explosive emotional reaction out of all proportion to the occasion. Why? Why this unreasonable anger at the sight of others who are happy or content, this growing contempt for people and the desire to hurt them? All right, you think they're fools, you despise them because their morals, their happiness is the source of your frustration and resentment. But these are dreadful enemies you carry within yourself--in time destructive as bullets. Mercifully, a bullet kills its victim. This other bacteria, permitted to age, does not kill a man but leaves in its wake the hulk of a creature torn and twisted; there is still fire within his being but it is kept alive by casting upon it faggots of scorn and hate.

Those secret tastes, defeated in the past by oranges and rhubarb, broke out into an irrepressible urge when she began to weep. She went back to eating earth. The first time she did it almost out of curiosity, sure that the bad taste would be the best cure for the temptation. And, in fact, she could not bear the earth in her mouth. But she persevered, overcome by the growing anxiety, and little by little she was getting back her ancestral appetite, the taste of primary minerals, the unbridled satisfaction of what was the original food. She would put handfuls of earth in her pockets, and ate them in small bits without being seen, with a confused feeling of pleasure and rage, as she instructed her girl friends in the most difficult needlepoint and spoke about other men, who did not deserve the sacrifice of having one eat the whitewash on the walls because of them. The handfuls of earth made the only man who deserved that show of degradation less remote and more certain, as if the ground that he walked on with his fine patent leather boo"

It was summertime, and two children scampered down the sidewalk toward a man approaching in the distance. The man waved, and the children raced each other to him. It was still summertime, and the children came closer. A boy trudged down the sidewalk dragging a fishingpole behind him. A man stood waiting with his hands on his hips. Summertime, and his children played in the front yeard with their friend, enacting a strange little drama of their own invention.

We believed in it, this downward motion: so lovely, like flying, and yet at the same time so dire, so extreme, so unlikely. God is love, they once said, but we reversed that, and love, like heaven, was always just around the corner. The more difficult it was to love the particular man beside us, the more we believed in Love, abstract and total. We were waiting, always, for the incarnation. That word, made flesh. And sometimes it happened, for a time. That kind of love comes and goes and is hard to remember afterwards, like pain. You would look at the man one day and you would think, I loved you, and the tense would be past, and you would be filled with a sense of wonder, because it was such an amazing and precarious and dumb thing to have done; and you would know too why your friends had been evasive about it, at the time."

For the grim years were removed from the face of Aragorn, and he seemed clothed in white, a young lord fall and fair; and he spoke words in the Elvish tongue to one whom Frodo could not see.

162,1972,watership down,5,"The full moon, well risen in a cloudless eastern sky, covered the high solitude with its light. We are not conscious of daylight as that which displaces darkness. Daylight, even when the sun is clear of clouds, seems to us simply the natural condition of the earth and air. When we think of the downs, we think of the downs in daylight, as with think of a rabbit with its fur on. Stubbs may have envisaged the skeleton inside the horse, but most of us do not: and we do not usually envisage the downs without daylight, even though the light is not a part of the down itself as the hide is part of the horse itself. We take daylight for granted. But moonlight is another matter. It is inconstant. The full moon wanes and returns again. Clouds may obscure it to an extent to which they cannot obscure daylight. Water is necessary to us, but a waterfall is not. Where it is to be found it is something extra, a beautiful ornament. We need daylight and to that extent it us utilitarian, but moonlight we do not need. When it comes, it serves no necessity. It transforms. It falls upon the banks and the grass, separating one long blade from another; turning a drift of brown, frosted leaves from a single heap to innumerable flashing fragments; or glimmering lengthways along wet twigs as though light itself were ductile.

Sometimes a book can be called from the dust and the dark to produce a book which can be bought in shops, and perhaps it is interesting, but the people who buy it and read it because it is interesting are not serious people, if they were serious they would not care about the interest they would be writing thousands of words to consign to the dust and the dark.

After reading', 'these words, one cannot but regret that Defoe did not try to create', 'heroines more virtuous than Moll Flanders and Roxana.', '', 'It is not only in drawing his characters that Defoe, in _The Fortunate', 'Mistress_, comes nearer than usual to producing a novel.

God Almighty hath been pleased to', 'put us into an imperfect state, where we have perpetual occasion of', ""each other's assistance.  There is none so low as not to be in a"", 'capacity of assisting the highest, nor so high as not to want the', 'assistance of the lowest.', '', 'It plainly appears, from what hath been said, that no one human', 'creature is more worthy than another in the sight of God, further', 'than according to the goodness or holiness of their lives; and that', 'power, wealth, and the like outward advantages, are so far from', ""being the marks of God's approving or preferring those on whom they"", 'are bestowed, that, on the contrary, He is pleased to suffer them to', 'be almost engrossed by those who have least title to His favour.', 'Now, according to this equality wherein God hath placed all mankind', 'with relation to Himself, you will observe that in all the relations', 'between man and man there is a mutual dependence, whereby the one', 'cannot subsist without the other.  Thus no man can be a prince', 'without subjects, nor a master without servants, nor a father', 'without children.  And this both explains and confirms the doctrine', 'of the text; for where there is a mutual dependence there must be a', 'mutual duty, and consequently a mutual subjection.  For instance,', 'the subject must obey his prince, because God commands it, human', 'laws require it, and the safety of the public makes it necessary;', 'for the same reasons we must obey all that are in authority, and', 'submit ourselves not only to the good and gentle, but also to the', 'froward, whether they rule according to our liking or not.  On the', 'other side, in those countries that pretend to freedom, princes are', 'subject to those laws which their people have chosen; they are bound', 'to protect their subjects in liberty, property, and religion, to', 'receive their petitions and redress their grievances, so that the', 'best prince is, in the opinion of wise men, only the greatest', 'servant of the nation--not only a servant to the public in general,', 'but in some sort to every man in it.  In the like manner a servant', 'owes obedience, and diligence, and faithfulness to his master, from', 'whom, at the same time, he hath a just demand for protection, and', 'maintenance, and gentle treatment.  Nay, even the poor beggar hath a', 'just demand of an alms from the rich man, who is guilty of fraud,', 'injustice, and oppression if he does not afford relief according to', 'his abilities.', '', 'But this subjection we all owe one another is nowhere more necessary', 'than in the common conversations of life, for without it there could', 'be no society among men.  If the learned would not sometimes submit', 'to the ignorant, the wise to the simple, the gentle to the froward,', 'the old to the weaknesses of the young, there would be nothing but', 'everlasting variance in the world.  This our Saviour Himself', 'confirmed by His own example; for He appeared in the form of a', ""servant and washed His disciples' feet, adding those memorable"", 'words, ""Ye call me Lord and Master, and ye say well, for so I am.', 'If I then, your Lord and Master, wash your feet, how much more ought', 'ye to wash one another\'s feet?""  Under which expression of washing', 'the feet is included all that subjection, assistance, love, and', 'duty, which every good Christian ought to pay his brother, in', 'whatever station God hath placed him.  For the greatest prince and', 'the meanest slave are not, by infinite degrees, so distant as our', 'Saviour and those disciples, whose feet He vouchsafed to wash.', '', 'And although this doctrine of subjecting ourselves to one another', 'may seem to grate upon the pride and vanity of mankind, and may', 'therefore be hard to be digested by those who value themselves upon', 'their greatness or their wealth, yet it is really no more than what', 'most men practise upon other occasions.  For if our neighbour, who', 'is our inferior, comes to see us, we rise to receive him; we place', 'him above us, and respect him as if he were better than ourselves;', 'and this is thought both decent and necessary, and is usually called', 'good manners.

Thus no man can be a prince', 'without subjects, nor a master without servants, nor a father', 'without children.  And this both explains and confirms the doctrine', 'of the text; for where there is a mutual dependence there must be a', 'mutual duty, and consequently a mutual subjection.  For instance,', 'the subject must obey his prince, because God commands it, human', 'laws require it, and the safety of the public makes it necessary;', 'for the same reasons we must obey all that are in authority, and', 'submit ourselves not only to the good and gentle, but also to the', 'froward, whether they rule according to our liking or not.

In the like manner a servant', 'owes obedience, and diligence, and faithfulness to his master, from', 'whom, at the same time, he hath a just demand for protection, and', 'maintenance, and gentle treatment.  Nay, even the poor beggar hath a', 'just demand of an alms from the rich man, who is guilty of fraud,', 'injustice, and oppression if he does not afford relief according to', 'his abilities.', '', 'But this subjection we all owe one another is nowhere more necessary', 'than in the common conversations of life, for without it there could', 'be no society among men.  If the learned would not sometimes submit', 'to the ignorant, the wise to the simple, the gentle to the froward,', 'the old to the weaknesses of the young, there would be nothing but', 'everlasting variance in the world.  This our Saviour Himself', 'confirmed by His own example; for He appeared in the form of a', ""servant and washed His disciples' feet, adding those memorable"", 'words, ""Ye call me Lord and Master, and ye say well, for so I am.', 'If I then, your Lord and Master, wash your feet, how much more ought', 'ye to wash one another\'s feet?""

112,1796,the monk,1,"an was born for society. However little He may be attached to the World, He never can wholly forget it, or bear to be wholly forgotten by it. Disgusted at the guilt or absurdity of Mankind, the Misanthrope flies from it: He resolves to become an Hermit, and buries himself in the Cavern of some gloomy Rock. While Hate inflames his bosom, possibly He may feel contented with his situation: But when his passions begin to cool; when Time has mellowed his sorrows, and healed those wounds which He bore with him to his solitude, think you that Content becomes his Companion? Ah! no, Rosario. No longer sustained by the violence of his passions, He feels all the monotony of his way of living, and his heart becomes the prey of Ennui and weariness. He looks round, and finds himself alone in the Universe: The love of society revives in his bosom, and He pants to return to that world which He has abandoned. Nature loses all her charms in his eyes: No one is near him to point out her beauties, or share in his admiration of her excellence and variety. Propped upon the fragment of some Rock, He gazes upon the tumbling waterfall with a vacant eye, He views without emotion the glory of the setting Sun. Slowly He returns to his Cell at Evening, for no one there is anxious for his arrival; He has no comfort in his solitary unsavoury meal: He throws himself upon his couch of Moss despondent and dissatisfied, and wakes only to pass a day as joyless, as monotonous as the form"

For it frequently happens in human life that promises need to be made and accepted, and actions undertaken, with regard to things for which, though not wrong in themselves, others need some assurance, but which lack the support of any human documentation. It might be argued that such assurance could be gained through the rigour of penal laws against lie telling, but while this could obtain in the state of the cities, it would not have been possible in the state of the families from which the cities arose, where there was as yet no civil or public rule under which two family fathers, for example, would be equally subject in justice to the armed force of the law."

It was observable that great part of the lands in these levels,', 'especially those on this side East Tilbury, are held by the', 'farmers, cow-keepers, and grazing butchers who live in and near', 'London, and that they are generally stocked (all the winter half', 'year) with large fat sheep, viz., Lincolnshire and Leicestershire', 'wethers, which they buy in Smithfield in September and October,', 'when the Lincolnshire and Leicestershire graziers sell off their', 'stock, and are kept here till Christmas, or Candlemas, or', 'thereabouts; and though they are not made at all fatter here than', 'they were when bought in, yet the farmer or butcher finds very good', 'advantage in it, by the difference of the price of mutton between', 'Michaelmas, when it is cheapest, and Candlemas, when it is dearest;', 'this is what the butchers value themselves upon, when they tell us', 'at the market that it is right marsh-mutton.', '', '3.

God Almighty hath been pleased to', 'put us into an imperfect state, where we have perpetual occasion of', ""each other's assistance.  There is none so low as not to be in a"", 'capacity of assisting the highest, nor so high as not to want the', 'assistance of the lowest.', '', 'It plainly appears, from what hath been said, that no one human', 'creature is more worthy than another in the sight of God, further', 'than according to the goodness or holiness of their lives; and that', 'power, wealth, and the like outward advantages, are so far from', ""being the marks of God's approving or preferring those on whom they"", 'are bestowed, that, on the contrary, He is pleased to suffer them to', 'be almost engrossed by those who have least title to His favour.', 'Now, according to this equality wherein God hath placed all mankind', 'with relation to Himself, you will observe that in all the relations', 'between man and man there is a mutual dependence, whereby the one', 'cannot subsist without the other.  Thus no man can be a prince', 'without subjects, nor a master without servants, nor a father', 'without children.  And this both explains and confirms the doctrine', 'of the text; for where there is a mutual dependence there must be a', 'mutual duty, and consequently a mutual subjection.  For instance,', 'the subject must obey his prince, because God commands it, human', 'laws require it, and the safety of the public makes it necessary;', 'for the same reasons we must obey all that are in authority, and', 'submit ourselves not only to the good and gentle, but also to the', 'froward, whether they rule according to our liking or not.  On the', 'other side, in those countries that pretend to freedom, princes are', 'subject to those laws which their people have chosen; they are bound', 'to protect their subjects in liberty, property, and religion, to', 'receive their petitions and redress their grievances, so that the', 'best prince is, in the opinion of wise men, only the greatest', 'servant of the nation--not only a servant to the public in general,', 'but in some sort to every man in it.  In the like manner a servant', 'owes obedience, and diligence, and faithfulness to his master, from', 'whom, at the same time, he hath a just demand for protection, and', 'maintenance, and gentle treatment.  Nay, even the poor beggar hath a', 'just demand of an alms from the rich man, who is guilty of fraud,', 'injustice, and oppression if he does not afford relief according to', 'his abilities.', '', 'But this subjection we all owe one another is nowhere more necessary', 'than in the common conversations of life, for without it there could', 'be no society among men.  If the learned would not sometimes submit', 'to the ignorant, the wise to the simple, the gentle to the froward,', 'the old to the weaknesses of the young, there would be nothing but', 'everlasting variance in the world.  This our Saviour Himself', 'confirmed by His own example; for He appeared in the form of a', ""servant and washed His disciples' feet, adding those memorable"", 'words, ""Ye call me Lord and Master, and ye say well, for so I am.', 'If I then, your Lord and Master, wash your feet, how much more ought', 'ye to wash one another\'s feet?""  Under which expression of washing', 'the feet is included all that subjection, assistance, love, and', 'duty, which every good Christian ought to pay his brother, in', 'whatever station God hath placed him.  For the greatest prince and', 'the meanest slave are not, by infinite degrees, so distant as our', 'Saviour and those disciples, whose feet He vouchsafed to wash.', '', 'And although this doctrine of subjecting ourselves to one another', 'may seem to grate upon the pride and vanity of mankind, and may', 'therefore be hard to be digested by those who value themselves upon', 'their greatness or their wealth, yet it is really no more than what', 'most men practise upon other occasions.  For if our neighbour, who', 'is our inferior, comes to see us, we rise to receive him; we place', 'him above us, and respect him as if he were better than ourselves;', 'and this is thought both decent and necessary, and is usually called', 'good manners.  Now the duty required by the Apostle is only that we', 'should enlarge our minds, and that what we thus practise in the', 'common course of life we should imitate in all our actions and', 'proceedings whatsoever; since our Saviour tells us that every man is', 'our neighbour, and since we are so ready, in point of civility, to', 'yield to others in our own houses, where only we have any title to', 'govern.', '', 'Having thus shown you what sort of subjection it is which all men', 'owe one another, and in what manner it ought to be paid, I shall now', 'draw some observations from what hath been said.', '', 'And first, a thorough practice of this duty of subjecting ourselves', 'to the wants and infirmities of each other would utterly extinguish', 'in us the vice of pride.', '', 'For if God has pleased to intrust me with a talent, not for my own', 'sake, but for the service of others, and at the same time hath left', 'me full of wants and necessities which others must supply, I can', 'then have no cause to set any extraordinary value upon myself, or to', 'despise my brother because he hath not the same talents which were', 'lent to me.  His being may probably be as useful to the public as', 'mine; and therefore, by the rules of right reason, I am in no sort', 'preferable to him.', '', 'Secondly, It is very manifest, from what has been said, that no man', 'ought to look upon the advantages of life, such as riches, honour,', 'power, and the like, as his property, but merely as a trust which', 'God hath deposited with him to be employed for the use of his', 'brethren, and God will certainly punish the breach of that trust,', 'though the laws of man will not, or rather indeed cannot; because', 'the trust was conferred only by God, who has not left it to any', 'power on earth to decide infallibly whether a man makes a good use', 'of his talents or not, or to punish him where he fails.

And in the morning, when I open my eyes, I behold the sun once more, and am wretched. If I were whimsical, I might blame the weather, or an acquaintance, or some personal disappointment, for my discontented mind; and then this insupportable load of trouble would not rest entirely upon myself. But, alas! I feel it too sadly; I am alone the cause of my own woe, am I not? Truly, my own bosom contains the source of all my pleasure. Am I not the same being who once enjoyed an excess of happiness, who at every step saw paradise open before him, and whose heart was ever expanded towards the whole world? And this heart is now dead; no sentiment can revive it. My eyes are dry; and my senses, no more refreshed by the influence of soft tears, wither and consume my brain. I suffer much, for I have lost the only charm of life: that active, sacred power which created worlds around me,—it is no more. When I look from my window at the distant hills, and behold the morning sun breaking through the mists, and illuminating the country around, which is still wrapped in silence, whilst the soft stream winds gently through the willows, which have shed their leaves; when glorious Nature displays all her beauties before me, and her wondrous prospects are ineffectual to extract one tear of joy from my withered heart,—I feel that in such a moment I stand like a reprobate before heaven, hardened, insensible, and unmoved.

Then said the Interpreter to a damsel who stood nearby, ""Bring water, and sprinkle the room."" When she had done as requested, it was swept and cleansed very pleasantly. Then Christian asked, ""What does this mean?"" The Interpreter answered, ""This parlor is the heart of a man that has never been sanctified by the sweet grace of the gospel; the dust is his original sin and inward corruptions that have defiled the whole man. The first man that began to sweep is the Law; the damsel that brought water and sprinkled it is the gospel.

The"", 'total value of these preferments was about 230 pounds a year, an', 'income which Miss Waring seems to have thought enough to justify him in', 'marrying.

There is none so low as not to be in a"", 'capacity of assisting the highest, nor so high as not to want the', 'assistance of the lowest.', '', 'It plainly appears, from what hath been said, that no one human', 'creature is more worthy than another in the sight of God, further', 'than according to the goodness or holiness of their lives; and that', 'power, wealth, and the like outward advantages, are so far from', ""being the marks of God's approving or preferring those on whom they"", 'are bestowed, that, on the contrary, He is pleased to suffer them to', 'be almost engrossed by those who have least title to His favour.', 'Now, according to this equality wherein God hath placed all mankind', 'with relation to Himself, you will observe that in all the relations', 'between man and man there is a mutual dependence, whereby the one', 'cannot subsist without the other.  Thus no man can be a prince', 'without subjects, nor a master without servants, nor a father', 'without children.  And this both explains and confirms the doctrine', 'of the text; for where there is a mutual dependence there must be a', 'mutual duty, and consequently a mutual subjection.  For instance,', 'the subject must obey his prince, because God commands it, human', 'laws require it, and the safety of the public makes it necessary;', 'for the same reasons we must obey all that are in authority, and', 'submit ourselves not only to the good and gentle, but also to the', 'froward, whether they rule according to our liking or not.  On the', 'other side, in those countries that pretend to freedom, princes are', 'subject to those laws which their people have chosen; they are bound', 'to protect their subjects in liberty, property, and religion, to', 'receive their petitions and redress their grievances, so that the', 'best prince is, in the opinion of wise men, only the greatest', 'servant of the nation--not only a servant to the public in general,', 'but in some sort to every man in it.  In the like manner a servant', 'owes obedience, and diligence, and faithfulness to his master, from', 'whom, at the same time, he hath a just demand for protection, and', 'maintenance, and gentle treatment.  Nay, even the poor beggar hath a', 'just demand of an alms from the rich man, who is guilty of fraud,', 'injustice, and oppression if he does not afford relief according to', 'his abilities.', '', 'But this subjection we all owe one another is nowhere more necessary', 'than in the common conversations of life, for without it there could', 'be no society among men.  If the learned would not sometimes submit', 'to the ignorant, the wise to the simple, the gentle to the froward,', 'the old to the weaknesses of the young, there would be nothing but', 'everlasting variance in the world.  This our Saviour Himself', 'confirmed by His own example; for He appeared in the form of a', ""servant and washed His disciples' feet, adding those memorable"", 'words, ""Ye call me Lord and Master, and ye say well, for so I am.', 'If I then, your Lord and Master, wash your feet, how much more ought', 'ye to wash one another\'s feet?""  Under which expression of washing', 'the feet is included all that subjection, assistance, love, and', 'duty, which every good Christian ought to pay his brother, in', 'whatever station God hath placed him.  For the greatest prince and', 'the meanest slave are not, by infinite degrees, so distant as our', 'Saviour and those disciples, whose feet He vouchsafed to wash.', '', 'And although this doctrine of subjecting ourselves to one another', 'may seem to grate upon the pride and vanity of mankind, and may', 'therefore be hard to be digested by those who value themselves upon', 'their greatness or their wealth, yet it is really no more than what', 'most men practise upon other occasions.  For if our neighbour, who', 'is our inferior, comes to see us, we rise to receive him; we place', 'him above us, and respect him as if he were better than ourselves;', 'and this is thought both decent and necessary, and is usually called', 'good manners.  Now the duty required by the Apostle is only that we', 'should enlarge our minds, and that what we thus practise in the', 'common course of life we should imitate in all our actions and', 'proceedings whatsoever; since our Saviour tells us that every man is', 'our neighbour, and since we are so ready, in point of civility, to', 'yield to others in our own houses, where only we have any title to', 'govern.', '', 'Having thus shown you what sort of subjection it is which all men', 'owe one another, and in what manner it ought to be paid, I shall now', 'draw some observations from what hath been said.', '', 'And first, a thorough practice of this duty of subjecting ourselves', 'to the wants and infirmities of each other would utterly extinguish', 'in us the vice of pride.', '', 'For if God has pleased to intrust me with a talent, not for my own', 'sake, but for the service of others, and at the same time hath left', 'me full of wants and necessities which others must supply, I can', 'then have no cause to set any extraordinary value upon myself, or to', 'despise my brother because he hath not the same talents which were', 'lent to me.  His being may probably be as useful to the public as', 'mine; and therefore, by the rules of right reason, I am in no sort', 'preferable to him.', '', 'Secondly, It is very manifest, from what has been said, that no man', 'ought to look upon the advantages of life, such as riches, honour,', 'power, and the like, as his property, but merely as a trust which', 'God hath deposited with him to be employed for the use of his', 'brethren, and God will certainly punish the breach of that trust,', 'though the laws of man will not, or rather indeed cannot; because', 'the trust was conferred only by God, who has not left it to any', 'power on earth to decide infallibly whether a man makes a good use', 'of his talents or not, or to punish him where he fails.  And', 'therefore God seems to have more particularly taken this matter into', 'His own hands, and will most certainly reward or punish']"

In the last year of Pope's life a"", 'proclamation was issued forbidding Catholics to come within ten miles of', 'London, and Pope himself, in spite of his influential friends, thought', 'it wise to comply with this edict. A fierce outburst of persecution', 'often evokes in the persecuted some of the noblest qualities of human', 'nature; but a long-continued and crushing tyranny that extends to all', 'the details of daily life is only too likely to have the most', 'unfortunate results on those who are subjected to it.

He was subject to violent headaches, and his face was lined and', 'contracted with the marks of suffering. In youth he so completely ruined', 'his health by perpetual studies that his life was despaired of, and only', 'the most careful treatment saved him from an early death. Toward the', 'close of his life he became so weak that he could neither dress nor', 'undress without assistance. He had to be laced up in stiff stays in', 'order to sit erect, and wore a fur doublet and three pairs of stockings', 'to protect himself against the cold. With these physical defects he had', 'the extreme sensitiveness of mind that usually accompanies chronic ill', 'health, and this sensitiveness was outraged incessantly by the brutal', ""customs of the age. Pope's enemies made as free with his person as with"", 'his poetry, and there is little doubt that he felt the former attacks', 'the more bitterly of the two. Dennis, his first critic, called him ""a', 'short squab gentleman, the very bow of the God of love; his outward form', 'is downright monkey."" A rival poet whom he had offended hung up a rod in', 'a coffee house where men of letters resorted, and threatened to whip', 'Pope like a naughty child if he showed his face there.

112,1796,the monk,1,"an was born for society. However little He may be attached to the World, He never can wholly forget it, or bear to be wholly forgotten by it. Disgusted at the guilt or absurdity of Mankind, the Misanthrope flies from it: He resolves to become an Hermit, and buries himself in the Cavern of some gloomy Rock. While Hate inflames his bosom, possibly He may feel contented with his situation: But when his passions begin to cool; when Time has mellowed his sorrows, and healed those wounds which He bore with him to his solitude, think you that Content becomes his Companion? Ah! no, Rosario. No longer sustained by the violence of his passions, He feels all the monotony of his way of living, and his heart becomes the prey of Ennui and weariness. He looks round, and finds himself alone in the Universe: The love of society revives in his bosom, and He pants to return to that world which He has abandoned. Nature loses all her charms in his eyes: No one is near him to point out her beauties, or share in his admiration of her excellence and variety. Propped upon the fragment of some Rock, He gazes upon the tumbling waterfall with a vacant eye, He views without emotion the glory of the setting Sun. Slowly He returns to his Cell at Evening, for no one there is anxious for his arrival; He has no comfort in his solitary unsavoury meal: He throws himself upon his couch of Moss despondent and dissatisfied, and wakes only to pass a day as joyless, as monotonous as the form"

And in the morning, when I open my eyes, I behold the sun once more, and am wretched. If I were whimsical, I might blame the weather, or an acquaintance, or some personal disappointment, for my discontented mind; and then this insupportable load of trouble would not rest entirely upon myself. But, alas! I feel it too sadly; I am alone the cause of my own woe, am I not? Truly, my own bosom contains the source of all my pleasure. Am I not the same being who once enjoyed an excess of happiness, who at every step saw paradise open before him, and whose heart was ever expanded towards the whole world? And this heart is now dead; no sentiment can revive it. My eyes are dry; and my senses, no more refreshed by the influence of soft tears, wither and consume my brain. I suffer much, for I have lost the only charm of life: that active, sacred power which created worlds around me,—it is no more. When I look from my window at the distant hills, and behold the morning sun breaking through the mists, and illuminating the country around, which is still wrapped in silence, whilst the soft stream winds gently through the willows, which have shed their leaves; when glorious Nature displays all her beauties before me, and her wondrous prospects are ineffectual to extract one tear of joy from my withered heart,—I feel that in such a moment I stand like a reprobate before heaven, hardened, insensible, and unmoved. Oftentimes do I then bend my knee to the earth, and implore God for the blessing of tears, as the desponding labour"

The poet then should have dropped his sneer when he says, ""If weak women go astray, The stars are more in fault than they."" For that they are bound by the adamantine chain of destiny is most certain, if it be proved that they are never to exercise their own reason, never to be independent, never to rise above opinion, or to feel the dignity of a rational will that only bows to God, and often forgets that the universe contains any being but itself, and the model of perfection to which its ardent gaze is turned, to adore attributes that, softened into virtues, may be imitated in kind, though the degree overwhelms the enraptured mind"

After He had reviewed it a little while, the Interpreter called for a man to come and sweep. Now when he began to sweep, the dust began to fly about so much and was so thick that Christian almost choked. Then said the Interpreter to a damsel who stood nearby, ""Bring water, and sprinkle the room."" When she had done as requested, it was swept and cleansed very pleasantly. Then Christian asked, ""What does this mean?"" The Interpreter answered, ""This parlor is the heart of a man that has never been sanctified by the sweet grace of the gospel; the dust is his original sin and inward corruptions that have defiled the whole man. The first man that began to sweep is the Law; the damsel that brought water and sprinkled it is the gospel. You saw that as soon as the first man began to sweep, the dust filled the room so thickly that it could not be cleansed, and you almost choked on it. This is to show you that the Law, instead of cleansing the heart from sin"

After all, they must write and print to live. Such practice', 'is certainly, he observes, no more unjust or disreputable than other', 'ways of gaining wealth such as one finds in Exchange-Alley.', '', 'This paragraph gains point when one remembers that Defoe had served', 'both Whig and Tory governments. In 1718, as letters written to Lord', 'Stanhope in that very year testify, he was engaged in the perhaps', 'dubious business of masquerading as a Tory, while actually in the', 'service of the Whig ministry, to take the ""sting"" out of the more', 'violent Tory periodicals; and he was much concerned with the danger of', 'his ambiguous position. In December of 1717 he had been identified as', ""a writer for _Mist's Weekly Journal_, the leading Tory paper, and was"", 'subjected to growing attacks in the Whig press. One can hardly doubt', 'that this paragraph is a thinly veiled defense of his own practice as', 'a professional journalist.', '', 'It is no surprise to find the author of _A Vindication_, in discussing', 'the qualifications of writers, advocating the importance of genius and', '""Natural Parts"" above mere learning. He instances the author of _The', 'True-Born Englishman_ and Shakespeare, the former ""Characteriz\'d as a', 'Person of Little Learning, but of prodigious Natural Parts"" and the', 'latter having ""but a small share of Literature."" The further example', 'of the literary achievements of the ""Fair Sex,"" who had, of course, no', ""university education, reminds one of Defoe's championship elsewhere of"", 'women. The business of a writer is ""to please and inform,"" and the', 'general implication is that genius is more necessary to this end than', 'learning.', '', 'Also characteristic of Defoe is his emphasis upon the advantage to an', 'author of conversation, ""the Aliment of Genius, the Life of all airy', 'Performances"" [p.32]. Likewise, his digression upon education [pp.', '34f.], his charge that people of quality in England all too often', ""neglect their children's education, his remarks upon the advantages of"", 'travel and the need of training in the vernacular, all will be', 'familiar to readers of Defoe.', '', '_A Vindication of the Press_ is chiefly important for the', 'corroboration of our knowledge of Daniel Defoe.

115,1725,new science,1,"e begin our principles with the idea that is the first in any work whatsoever: divine Providence, who is the architect of this world of nations. For men cannot unite in a human society unless they share ahuman sense that there is a divinity who sees into the depths of their hearts, since a society of men can neither begin nor remain stable without a means whereby some rely upon the promises of others and are satisfied by their assertions in secret matters. For it frequently happens in human life that promises need to be made and accepted, and actions undertaken, with regard to things for which, though not wrong in themselves, others need some assurance, but which lack the support of any human documentation. It might be argued that such assurance could be gained through the rigour of penal laws against lie telling, but while this could obtain in the state of the cities, it would not have been possible in the state of the families from which the cities arose, where there was as yet no civil or public rule under which two family fathers, for example, would be equally subject in justice to the armed force of the law."

102,1774,the sorrows of young werther,1,"tness, Heaven, how often I lie down in my bed with a wish, and even a hope, that I may never awaken again! And in the morning, when I open my eyes, I behold the sun once more, and am wretched. If I were whimsical, I might blame the weather, or an acquaintance, or some personal disappointment, for my discontented mind; and then this insupportable load of trouble would not rest entirely upon myself. But, alas! I feel it too sadly; I am alone the cause of my own woe, am I not? Truly, my own bosom contains the source of all my pleasure. Am I not the same being who once enjoyed an excess of happiness, who at every step saw paradise open before him, and whose heart was ever expanded towards the whole world? And this heart is now dead; no sentiment can revive it. My eyes are dry; and my senses, no more refreshed by the influence of soft tears, wither and consume my brain. I suffer much, for I have lost the only charm of life: that active, sacred power which created worlds around me,—it is no more. When I look from my window at the distant hills, and behold the morning sun breaking through the mists, and illuminating the country around, which is still wrapped in silence, whilst the soft stream winds gently through the willows, which have shed their leaves; when glorious Nature displays all her beauties before me, and her wondrous prospects are ineffectual to extract one tear of joy from my withered heart,—I feel that in such a moment I stand like a reprobate before heaven, hardened, insensible, and unmoved. Oftentimes do I then bend my knee to the earth, and implore God for the blessing of tears, as the desponding labour"

Parliament had been for a long time only partially', 'representative of the people; it now ceased to be so almost completely.', '', 'With, the support which such methods secured, along with encouragement from his', 'ministers, the king was prepared to put in operation his policy for regulating', 'the affairs of America. Writs of Assistance (1761) were followed by the passage', 'of the Stamp Act (1765). The ostensible object of both these measures was to', 'help pay the debt incurred by the French war, but the real purpose lay deeper,', 'and was nothing more or less than the ultimate extension of parliamentary rule,', 'in great things as well as small, to America. At this crisis, so momentous for', 'the colonists, the Rockingham ministry was formed, and Burke, together with', 'Pitt, supported a motion for the unconditional repeal of the Stamp Act. After', 'much wrangling, the motion was carried, and the first blunder of the mother', 'country seemed to have been smoothed over.', '', 'Only a few months elapsed, however, when the question of taxing the colonies was', 'revived. Pitt lay ill, and could take no part in the proposed measure. Through', 'the influence of other members of his party,--notably Townshend,--a series of', 'acts were passed, imposing duties on several exports to America. This was', 'followed by a suspension of the New York Assembly, because it had disregarded', 'instructions in the matter of supplies for the troops. The colonists were', 'furious. Matters went from bad to worse. To withdraw as far as possible without', 'yielding the principle at stake, the duties on all the exports mentioned in the', 'bill were removed, except that on tea. But it was precisely the principle for', 'which the colonists were contending. They were not in the humor for compromise,', 'when they believed their freedom was endangered, and the strength and', 'determination of their resistance found a climax in the Boston Tea Party.', '', 'In the meantime, Lord North, who was absolutely obedient to the king, had become', 'prime minister. Five bills were prepared, the tenor of which, it was thought,', 'would overawe the colonists. Of these, the Boston Port Bill and the Regulating', 'Act are perhaps the most famous, though the ultimate tendency of all was blindly', 'coercive.', '', 'While the king and his friends were busy with these, the opposition proposed an', 'unconditional repeal of the Tea Act. The bill was introduced only to be', 'overwhelmingly defeated by the same Parliament that passed the five measures of', 'Lord North.', '', 'In America, the effect of these proceedings was such as might have been expected', 'by thinking men. The colonies were as a unit in their support of Massachusetts.', ""The Regulating Act was set at defiance, public officers in the king's service"", 'were forced to resign, town meetings were held, and preparations for war were', ""begun in dead earnest. To avert this, some of England's greatest statesmen--Pitt"", 'among the number--asked for a reconsideration. On February the first, 1775, a', 'bill was introduced, which would have gone far toward bringing peace. One month', 'later, Burke delivered his speech on Conciliation with the Colonies.', '', '', '', '', 'EDMUND BURKE', '', ""There is nothing unusual in Burke's early life. He was born in Dublin, Ireland,"", 'in 1729. His father was a successful lawyer and a Protestant, his mother, a', 'Catholic. At the age of twelve, he became a pupil of Abraham Shackleton, a', 'Quaker, who had been teaching some fifteen years at Ballitore, a small town', 'thirty miles from Dublin. In after years Burke was always pleased to speak of', 'his old friend in the kindest way: ""If I am anything,"" he declares, ""it is the', 'education I had there that has made me so."" And again at Shackleton\'s death,', 'when Burke was near the zenith of his fame and popularity, he writes: ""I had a', 'true honor and affection for that excellent man. I feel something like a', 'satisfaction in the midst of my concern, that I was fortunate enough to have him', 'under my roof before his departure."" It can hardly be doubted that the old', 'Quaker schoolmaster succeeded with his pupil who was already so favorably', 'inclined, and it is more than probable that the daily example of one who lived', 'out his precepts was strong in its influence upon a young and generous mind.', '', 'Burke attended school at Ballitore two years; then, at the age of fourteen, he', 'became a student at Trinity College, Dublin, and remained there five years. At', 'college he was unsystematic and careless of routine. He seems to have done', 'pretty much as he pleased, and, however methodical he became in after life, his', 'study during these five years was rambling and spasmodic. The only definite', 'knowledge we have of this period is given by Burke himself in letters to his', 'former friend Richard Shackleton, son of his old schoolmaster. What he did was', 'done with a zest that at times became a feverish impatience: ""First I was', 'greatly taken with natural philosophy, which, while I should have given my mind', 'to logic, employed me incessantly. This I call my FUROR MATHEMATICUS."" Following', 'in succession come his FUROR LOGICUS, FUROR HISTORICUS, and FUROR PEOTICUS, each', 'of which absorbed him for the time being. It would be wrong, however, to think', 'of Burke as a trifler even in his youth. He read in the library three hours', 'every day and we may be sure he read as intelligently as eagerly. It is more', 'than probable that like a few other great minds he did not need a rigid system', 'to guide him. If he chose his subjects of study at pleasure, there is every', 'reason to believe he mastered them.', '', 'Of intimate friends at the University we hear nothing. Goldsmith came one year', 'later, but there is no evidence that they knew each other. It is probable that', 'Burke, always reserved, had little in common with his young associates. His own', 'musings, with occasional attempts at writing poetry, long walks through the', 'country, and frequent letters to and from Richard Shackleton, employed him when', 'not at his books.', '', 'Two years after taking his degree, Burke went to London and established himself', 'at the Middle Temple for the u']"

Daren Lane held to his maimed', 'comrade while they stood bare-headed and erect for that moment when', 'the, ship passed the statue. Lane knew what Blair felt. But nothing of', 'what that feeling was could ever be spoken. The deck of the ship was', 'now crowded with passengers, yet they were seemingly dead to anything', 'more than a safe arrival at their destination. They were not crippled', 'American soldiers.

I had been having Brett for a friend. I had not been thinking about her side of it. I had been getting something for nothing. That only delayed the presentation of the bill. The bill always came. That was one of the swell things you could count on. I thought I had paid for everything. Not like the woman pays and pays and pays. No idea of retribution or punishment. Just exchange of values. You gave up something and got something else. Or you worked for something. You paid some way for everything that was any good. I paid my way into enough things that I liked, so that I had a good time. Either you paid by learning about them, or by experience, or by taking chances, or by money.

I had been having Brett for a friend. I had not been thinking about her side of it. I had been getting something for nothing. That only delayed the presentation of the bill. The bill always came. That was one of the swell things you could count on. I thought I had paid for everything. Not like the woman pays and pays and pays. No idea of retribution or punishment. Just exchange of values. You gave up something and got something else. Or you worked for something. You paid some way for everything that was any good. I paid my way into enough things that I liked, so that I had a good time. Either you paid by learning about them, or by experience, or by taking chances, or by money.

Let's persuade our more erotic poets to write about the delights of the flesh, and induce some of our robust journalists to contribute stories of famous amours.

We'll choose the keenest satirist alive to compile a deity from all the deities worshipped by mankind, a deity who will be more magnificent than any of them, and yet so weakly human that he'll become a byword for laughter the world over--and we'll ascribe to him all sorts of jokes and vanities and rages, in which he'll be supposed to indulge for his own diversion, so that the people will read our book and ponder it, and there'll be no more nonsense in the world"

Panhandle was in rapture.  For him!  He', 'could have burst for very joy, but he could not speak.  It developed', 'that his mother would not let him ride the pony except when she led it.', 'This roused as great a grief as possession was joy.  A beautiful little', 'pony he could not ride!

The movement', 'consists of two parts: a moral basis, which is common to all, and a', 'scheme of social application which varies a good deal. For the moral', ""basis, it is obvious that man's ethical responsibility varies with his"", 'knowledge of consequences. If I were in charge of a baby (like Dr.', 'Johnson in that tower of vision), and if the baby was ill through', 'having eaten the soap, I might possibly send for a doctor.

Now the Eugenic moral basis is', 'this; that the baby for whom we are primarily and directly responsible', 'is the babe unborn. That is, that we know (or may come to know) enough', 'of certain inevitable tendencies in biology to consider the fruit of', 'some contemplated union in that direct and clear light of conscience', 'which we can now only fix on the other partner in that union. The one', 'duty can conceivably be as definite as or more definite than the', 'other. The baby that does not exist can be considered even before the', 'wife who does. Now it is essential to grasp that this is a', 'comparatively new note in morality. Of course sane people always', 'thought the aim of marriage was the procreation of children to the', 'glory of God or according to the plan of Nature; but whether they', ""counted such children as God's reward for service or Nature's premium"", 'on sanity, they always left the reward to God or the premium to', 'Nature, as a less definable thing. The only person (and this is the', 'point) towards whom one could have precise duties was the partner in', ""the process.

Both Moslem and', 'Christian would have thought such speculations not only impious but', 'utterly unpractical. I quite agree with them; but that is not the', 'point here.', '', 'The point here is that a new school believes Eugenics _against_', 'Ethics. And it is proved by one familiar fact: that the heroisms of', ""history are actually the crimes of Eugenics. The Eugenists' books and"", 'articles are full of suggestions that non-eugenic unions should and', 'may come to be regarded as we regard sins; that we should really feel', 'that marrying an invalid is a kind of cruelty to children. But history', 'is full of the praises of people who have held sacred such ties to', 'invalids; of cases like those of Colonel Hutchinson and Sir William', 'Temple, who remained faithful to betrothals when beauty and health had', 'been apparently blasted. And though the illnesses of Dorothy Osborne', 'and Mrs. Hutchinson may not fall under the Eugenic speculations (I do', 'not know), it is obvious that they might have done so; and certainly', ""it would not have made any difference to men's moral opinion of the"", 'act. I do not discuss here which morality I favour; but I insist that', 'they are opposite. The Eugenist really sets up as saints the very men', 'whom hundreds of families have called sneaks. To be consistent, they', 'ought to put up statues to the men who deserted their loves because of', 'bodily misfortune; with inscriptions celebrating the good Eugenist', 'who, on his fiancÃ©e falling off a bicycle, nobly refused to marry her;', 'or to the young hero who, on hearing of an uncle with erysipelas,', 'magnanimously broke his word.

But it wearied them to think that within a few years after their death many cults and systems and prognostications would be ascribed to them which they had never meditated nor intended. So they said to one another: ""'Let's join together and make a great book that will last forever to mock the credulity of man. Let's persuade our more erotic poets to write about the delights of the flesh, and induce some of our robust journalists to contribute stories of famous amours. We'll include all the most preposterous old wives' tales now current. We'll choose the keenest satirist alive to compile a deity from all the deities worshipped by mankind, a deity who will be more magnificent than any of them, and yet so weakly human that he'll become a byword for laughter the world over--and we'll ascribe to him all sorts of jokes and vanities and rages, in which he'll be supposed to indulge for his own diversion, so that the people will read our book and ponder it, and there'll be no more nonsense in the world"

But Eugenics', 'itself does exist for those who have sense enough to see that ideas', 'exist; and Eugenics itself, in large quantities or small, coming', 'quickly or coming slowly, urged from good motives or bad, applied to a', 'thousand people or applied to three, Eugenics itself is a thing no', 'more to be bargained about than poisoning.', '', 'It is not really difficult to sum up the essence of Eugenics: though', 'some of the Eugenists seem to be rather vague about it. The movement', 'consists of two parts: a moral basis, which is common to all, and a', 'scheme of social application which varies a good deal. For the moral', ""basis, it is obvious that man's ethical responsibility varies with his"", 'knowledge of consequences. If I were in charge of a baby (like Dr.', 'Johnson in that tower of vision), and if the baby was ill through', 'having eaten the soap, I might possibly send for a doctor. I might be', 'calling him away from much more serious cases, from the bedsides of', 'babies whose diet had been far more deadly; but I should be justified.', 'I could not be expected to know enough about his other patients to be', 'obliged (or even entitled) to sacrifice to them the baby for whom I', 'was primarily and directly responsible. Now the Eugenic moral basis is', 'this; that the baby for whom we are primarily and directly responsible', 'is the babe unborn. That is, that we know (or may come to know) enough', 'of certain inevitable tendencies in biology to consider the fruit of', 'some contemplated union in that direct and clear light of conscience', 'which we can now only fix on the other partner in that union. The one', 'duty can conceivably be as definite as or more definite than the', 'other. The baby that does not exist can be considered even before the', 'wife who does. Now it is essential to grasp that this is a', 'comparatively new note in morality. Of course sane people always', 'thought the aim of marriage was the procreation of children to the', 'glory of God or according to the plan of Nature; but whether they', ""counted such children as God's reward for service or Nature's premium"", 'on sanity, they always left the reward to God or the premium to', 'Nature, as a less definable thing. The only person (and this is the', 'point) towards whom one could have precise duties was the partner in', ""the process. Directly considering the partner's claims was the nearest"", 'one could get to indirectly considering the claims of posterity. If', 'the women of the harem sang praises of the hero as the Moslem mounted', 'his horse, it was because this was the due of a man; if the Christian', 'knight helped his wife off her horse, it was because this was the due', 'of a woman. Definite and detailed dues of this kind they did not', 'predicate of the babe unborn; regarding him in that agnostic and', 'opportunist light in which Mr. Browdie regarded the hypothetical child', 'of Miss Squeers. Thinking these sex relations healthy, they naturally', 'hoped they would produce healthy children; but that was all. The', 'Moslem woman doubtless expected Allah to send beautiful sons to an', 'obedient wife; but she would not have allowed any direct vision of', 'such sons to alter the obedience itself. She would not have said, ""I', 'will now be a disobedient wife; as the learned leech informs me that', 'great prophets are often the children of disobedient wives."" The', 'knight doubtless hoped that the saints would help him to strong', 'children, if he did all the duties of his station, one of which might', 'be helping his wife off her horse; but he would not have refrained', 'from doing this because he had read in a book that a course of falling', 'off horses often resulted in the birth of a genius. Both Moslem and', 'Christian would have thought such speculations not only impious but', 'utterly unpractical. I quite agree with them; but that is not the', 'point here.', '', 'The point here is that a new school believes Eugenics _against_', 'Ethics. And it is proved by one familiar fact: that the heroisms of', ""history are actually the crimes of Eugenics. The Eugenists' books and"", 'articles are full of suggestions that non-eugenic unions should and', 'may come to be regarded as we regard sins; that we should really feel', 'that marrying an invalid is a kind of cruelty to children. But history', 'is full of the praises of people who have held sacred such ties to', 'invalids; of cases like those of Colonel Hutchinson and Sir William', 'Temple, who remained faithful to betrothals when beauty and health had', 'been apparently blasted. And though the illnesses of Dorothy Osborne', 'and Mrs. Hutchinson may not fall under the Eugenic speculations (I do', 'not know), it is obvious that they might have done so; and certainly', ""it would not have made any difference to men's moral opinion of the"", 'act. I do not discuss here which morality I favour; but I insist that', 'they are opposite. The Eugenist really sets up as saints the very men', 'whom hundreds of families have called sneaks. To be consistent, they', 'ought to put up statues to the men who deserted their loves because of', 'bodily misfortune; with inscriptions celebrating the good Eugenist', 'who, on his fiancÃ©e falling off a bicycle, nobly refused to marry her;', 'or to the young hero who, on hearing of an uncle with erysipelas,', 'magnanimously broke his word. What is perfectly plain is this: that', 'mankind have hitherto held the bond between man and woman so sacred,', 'and the effect of it on the children so incalculable, that they have', 'always admired the maintenance of honour more than the maintenance of', 'safety. Doubtless they thought that even the children might be none', 'the worse for not being the children of cowards and shirkers; but this', 'was not the first thought, the first commandment. Briefly, we may say', 'that while many moral systems have set restraints on sex almost as', 'severe as any Eugenist could set, they have almost always had the', 'character of securing the fidelity of the two sexes to each other, and', 'leaving the rest to God. To introduce an ethic which makes that', 'fidelity or infidelity vary with some calculation about heredity is', 'that rarest of all t']"

Our trepidation increased as she went"", 'on. Not a word of it seemed to be true, and the style in which it was', 'written was execrable.', '', '""Poetry! Poetry!"" we cried, impatiently. ""Read us poetry!"" I cannot', 'describe the desolation which fell upon us as she opened a little volume', 'and mouthed out the verbose, sentimental foolery which it contained.', '', '""It must have been written by a woman,"" one of us urged. But no. She', 'told us that it was written by a young man, one of the most famous poets', 'of the day. I leave you to imagine what the shock of the discovery was.', 'Though we all cried and begged her to read no more, she persisted and', 'read us extracts from the Lives of the Lord Chancellors.

""It\'s all our fault,"" she', 'said. ""Every one of us knows how to read. But no one, save Poll, has', 'ever taken the trouble to do it. I, for one, have taken it for granted', ""that it was a woman's duty to spend her youth in bearing children. I"", 'venerated my mother for bearing ten; still more my grandmother for', 'bearing fifteen; it was, I confess, my own ambition to bear twenty. We', 'have gone on all these ages supposing that men were equally industrious,', 'and that their works were of equal merit. While we have borne the', 'children, they, we supposed, have borne the books and the pictures. We', 'have populated the world. They have civilized it.

We were very young. You can', 'judge of our simplicity when I tell you that before parting that night', 'we agreed that the objects of life were to produce good people and good', 'books. Our questions were to be directed to finding out how far these', 'objects were now attained by men. We vowed solemnly that we would not', 'bear a single child until we were satisfied.', '', ""Off we went then, some to the British Museum; others to the King's Navy;"", 'some to Oxford; others to Cambridge; we visited the Royal Academy and', 'the Tate; heard modern music in concert rooms, went to the Law Courts,', 'and saw new plays.

""How?"" he bellowed.', '""With the cane of course!"" Seeing that he was beside himself with rage', 'and expecting that her last moment had come, she bent over and received,', 'to her amazement, six light taps upon the behind. ""The honour of the', 'British Navy is avenged!"" he cried, and, raising herself, she saw him', 'with the sweat pouring down his face holding out a trembling right hand.', '""Away!"" she exclaimed, striking an attitude and imitating the ferocity', 'of his own expression, ""My honour has still to be satisfied!"" ""Spoken', 'like a gentleman!"" he returned, and fell into profound thought.

His', 'consciousness of his own powers amounts to exultation. He is like the', 'steed who glories in that tremendous gallop which affects the spectator', ""with fear. Indeed, we never can separate our conception of Dryden's"", 'vigorous and vaulting style from the image of a noble horse, devouring', 'the dust of the field, clearing obstacles at a bound, taking up long', 'leagues as a little thing, and the very strength and speed of whose', 'motion give it at a distance the appearance of smoothness.

We know no poet since Homer who can be compared', 'to Dryden in this respect, except Scott, who occasionally, in ""Marmion,""', 'and the ""Lay of the Last Minstrel,"" exhibits the same impetuous ease and', 'fiery fluent movement.

Scott exhibits in his poetry the soul of a warrior; but it is of', 'a warrior of the Border--somewhat savage and coarse. Dryden can, for the', 'nonce at least, assume the appearance, and display the spirit, of a', 'knight of ancient chivalry--gallant, accomplished, elegant, and gay.', '', ""Next to this poet's astonishing ease, spirit, and elastic vigour, may be"", 'ranked his clear, sharp intellect.

Indeed, keen, strong intellect, inflamed', 'with passion, and inspirited by that ""ardour and impetuosity of mind""', 'which Wordsworth is compelled to allow to him, rather than creative or', 'original genius, is the differentia of Dryden. We have compared him to a', 'courser, but he was not one of those coursers of Achilles, who fed on no', 'earthly food, but on the golden barley of heaven, having sprung from the', 'gods--', '', '  [Greek: Xanthon kai Balion, to ama pnoiaesi, petesthaen.', '  Tous eteke Zephuro anemo Arpua Podargae.]', '', 'Dryden resembled rather the mortal steed which was yoked with these', 'immortal twain, the brood of Zephyr and the Harpy Podarga; only we can', 'hardly say of the poet what Homer says of Pedasus--', '', '[Greek: Os kai thnaetos eon, epeth ippois athanatoisi.]', '', 'He was _not_, although a mortal, able to keep up with the immortal', 'coursers. His path was on the plains or table-lands of earth--never or', 'seldom in ""cloudland, gorgeous land,"" or through the aerial altitudes', 'which stretch away and above the clouds to the gates of heaven. He can', 'hardly be said to have possessed the power of sublimity, in the high', 'sense of that term, as the power of sympathising with the feeling of the', 'Infinite. Often he gives us the impression of the picturesque, of the', 'beautiful, of the heroic, of the nobly disdainful--but never (when', 'writing, at least, entirely from his own mind) of that infinite and', 'nameless grandeur which the imaginative soul feels shed on it from the', 'multitudinous waves of ocean--from the cataract leaping from his rock,', 'as if to consummate an act of prayer to God--from the hum of great', 'assemblies of men--from the sight of far-extended wastes and', 'wildernesses--and from the awful silence, and the still more mysterious', 'sparkle of the midnight stars. This sense of the presence of the', '_shadow_ of immensity--immensity itself cannot be felt any more than', 'measured--this sight like that vouchsafed to Moses of the ""backparts"" of', 'the Divine--the Divine itself cannot be seen--has been the inspiration', 'of all the highest poetry of the world--of the ""Paradise Lost,"" of the', '""Divina Commedia,"" of the ""Night Thoughts,"" of Wordsworth and Coleridge,', 'of ""Festus,"" and, highest far, of the Hebrew Prophets, as they cry,', '""Whither can we go from Thy presence? whither can we flee from Thy', 'Spirit?"" Such poets have resembled a blind man, who feels, although he', 'cannot see, that a stranger of commanding air is in the room beside him;', 'so they stand awe-struck in the ""wind of the going"" of a majestic and', 'unseen Being. This feeling differs from mysticism, inasmuch as it is', 'connected with a reality, while the mystic dreams a vague and', 'unsupported dream, and the poetry it produces is simply the irresistible', 'cry springing from the perception of this wondrous Some One who is', 'actually near them.

Whether', 'he discusses the deep questions of fate and foreknowledge in ""Religio', 'Laici,"" or lashes Shaftesbury in the ""Medal,"" or pours a torrent of', 'contempt on Shadwell in ""MacFlecknoe,"" or describes the fire of London', 'in the ""Annus Mirabilis,"" or soars into lyric enthusiasm in his ""Ode on', 'the Death of Mrs Killigrew,"" and ""Alexander\'s Feast,"" or paints a', 'tournament in ""Palamon and Arcite,"" or a fairy dance in the ""Flower and', 'the Leaf,""--he is always at home, and always aware that he is. His', 'consciousness of his own powers amounts to exultation. He is like the', 'steed who glories in that tremendous gallop which affects the spectator', ""with fear. Indeed, we never can separate our conception of Dryden's"", 'vigorous and vaulting style from the image of a noble horse, devouring', 'the dust of the field, clearing obstacles at a bound, taking up long', 'leagues as a little thing, and the very strength and speed of whose', 'motion give it at a distance the appearance of smoothness. Pope speaks', 'of his', '', '""Long resounding march, and energy divine.""', '', 'Perhaps ""_ease_ divine"" had been words more characteristic of that', 'almost superhuman power of language by which he makes the most obstinate', 'materials pliant, melts down difficulties as if by the touch of magic,', 'and, to resume the former figure, comes into the goal without a hair', 'turned on his mane, or a single sweat-drop confessing effort or', 'extraordinary exertion. We know no poet since Homer who can be compared', 'to Dryden in this respect, except Scott, who occasionally, in ""Marmion,""', 'and the ""Lay of the Last Minstrel,"" exhibits the same impetuous ease and', 'fiery fluent movement. Scott does not, however, in general, carry the', 'same weight as the other; and the species of verse he uses, in', 'comparison to the heroic rhyme of Dryden, gives you often the impression', 'of a hard trot, rather than of a ""long-resounding"" and magnificent', 'gallop. Scott exhibits in his poetry the soul of a warrior; but it is of', 'a warrior of the Border--somewhat savage and coarse. Dryden can, for the', 'nonce at least, assume the appearance, and display the spirit, of a', 'knight of ancient chivalry--gallant, accomplished, elegant, and gay.', '', ""Next to this poet's astonishing ease, spirit, and elastic vigour, may be"", 'ranked his clear, sharp intellect. He may be called more a logician than', 'a poet. He reasons often, and always acutely, and his rhyme, instead of', 'shackling, strengthens the movement of his argumentation. Parts of his', '""Religio Laici"" and the ""Hind and Panther"" resemble portions of Duns', 'Scotus or Aquinas set on fire. Indeed, keen, strong intellect, inflamed', 'with passion, and inspirited by that ""ardour and impetuosity of mind""', 'which Wordsworth is compelled to allow to him, rather than creative or', 'original genius, is the differentia of Dryden. We have compared him to a', 'courser, but he was not one of those coursers of Achilles, who fed on no', 'earthly food, but on the golden barley of heaven, having sprung from the', 'gods--', '', '  [Greek: Xanthon kai Balion, to ama pnoiaesi, petesthaen.', '  Tous eteke Zephuro anemo Arpua Podargae.]', '', 'Dryden resembled rather the mortal steed which was yoked with these', 'immortal twain, the brood of Zephyr and the Harpy Podarga; only we can', 'hardly say of the poet what Homer says of Pedasus--', '', '[Greek: Os kai thnaetos eon, epeth ippois athanatoisi.]', '', 'He was _not_, although a mortal, able to keep up with the immortal', 'coursers. His path was on the plains or table-lands of earth--never or', 'seldom in ""cloudland, gorgeous land,"" or through the aerial altitudes', 'which stretch away and above the clouds to the gates of heaven. He can', 'hardly be said to have possessed the power of sublimity, in the high', 'sense of that term, as the power of sympathising with the feeling of the', 'Infinite. Often he gives us the impression of the picturesque, of the', 'beautiful, of the heroic, of the nobly disdainful--but never (when', 'writing, at least, entirely from his own mind) of that infinite and', 'nameless grandeur which the imaginative soul feels shed on it from the', 'multitudinous waves of ocean--from the cataract leaping from his rock,', 'as if to consummate an act of prayer to God--from the hum of great', 'assemblies of men--from the sight of far-extended wastes and', 'wildernesses--and from the awful silence, and the still more mysterious', 'sparkle of the midnight stars. This sense of the presence of the', '_shadow_ of immensity--immensity itself cannot be felt any more than', 'measured--this sight like that vouchsafed to Moses of the ""backparts"" of', 'the Divine--the Divine itself cannot be seen--has been the inspiration', 'of all the highest poetry of the world--of the ""Paradise Lost,"" of the', '""Divina Commedia,"" of the ""Night Thoughts,"" of Wordsworth and Coleridge,', 'of ""Festus,"" and, highest far, of the Hebrew Prophets, as they cry,', '""Whither can we go from Thy presence? whither can we flee from Thy', 'Spirit?"" Such poets have resembled a blind man, who feels, although he', 'cannot see, that a stranger of commanding air is in the room beside him;', 'so they stand awe-struck in the ""wind of the going"" of a majestic and', 'unseen Being. This feeling differs from mysticism, inasmuch as it is', 'connected with a reality, while the mystic dreams a vague and', 'unsupported dream, and the poetry it produces is simply the irresistible', 'cry springing from the perception of this wondrous Some One who is', 'actually near them. The feeling is connected, in general, with a lofty', 'moral and religious nature; and yet not always, since, while wanting in', 'Dryden, we find it intensely discovered, although in an imperfect and', 'perverted shape, in By']"

Whether', 'he discusses the deep questions of fate and foreknowledge in ""Religio', 'Laici,"" or lashes Shaftesbury in the ""Medal,"" or pours a torrent of', 'contempt on Shadwell in ""MacFlecknoe,"" or describes the fire of London', 'in the ""Annus Mirabilis,"" or soars into lyric enthusiasm in his ""Ode on', 'the Death of Mrs Killigrew,"" and ""Alexander\'s Feast,"" or paints a', 'tournament in ""Palamon and Arcite,"" or a fairy dance in the ""Flower and', 'the Leaf,""--he is always at home, and always aware that he is. His', 'consciousness of his own powers amounts to exultation. He is like the', 'steed who glories in that tremendous gallop which affects the spectator', ""with fear. Indeed, we never can separate our conception of Dryden's"", 'vigorous and vaulting style from the image of a noble horse, devouring', 'the dust of the field, clearing obstacles at a bound, taking up long', 'leagues as a little thing, and the very strength and speed of whose', 'motion give it at a distance the appearance of smoothness. Pope speaks', 'of his', '', '""Long resounding march, and energy divine.""', '', 'Perhaps ""_ease_ divine"" had been words more characteristic of that', 'almost superhuman power of language by which he makes the most obstinate', 'materials pliant, melts down difficulties as if by the touch of magic,', 'and, to resume the former figure, comes into the goal without a hair', 'turned on his mane, or a single sweat-drop confessing effort or', 'extraordinary exertion. We know no poet since Homer who can be compared', 'to Dryden in this respect, except Scott, who occasionally, in ""Marmion,""', 'and the ""Lay of the Last Minstrel,"" exhibits the same impetuous ease and', 'fiery fluent movement.

Scott exhibits in his poetry the soul of a warrior; but it is of', 'a warrior of the Border--somewhat savage and coarse. Dryden can, for the', 'nonce at least, assume the appearance, and display the spirit, of a', 'knight of ancient chivalry--gallant, accomplished, elegant, and gay.', '', ""Next to this poet's astonishing ease, spirit, and elastic vigour, may be"", 'ranked his clear, sharp intellect. He may be called more a logician than', 'a poet. He reasons often, and always acutely, and his rhyme, instead of', 'shackling, strengthens the movement of his argumentation. Parts of his', '""Religio Laici"" and the ""Hind and Panther"" resemble portions of Duns', 'Scotus or Aquinas set on fire. Indeed, keen, strong intellect, inflamed', 'with passion, and inspirited by that ""ardour and impetuosity of mind""', 'which Wordsworth is compelled to allow to him, rather than creative or', 'original genius, is the differentia of Dryden. We have compared him to a', 'courser, but he was not one of those coursers of Achilles, who fed on no', 'earthly food, but on the golden barley of heaven, having sprung from the', 'gods--', '', '  [Greek: Xanthon kai Balion, to ama pnoiaesi, petesthaen.', '  Tous eteke Zephuro anemo Arpua Podargae.]', '', 'Dryden resembled rather the mortal steed which was yoked with these', 'immortal twain, the brood of Zephyr and the Harpy Podarga; only we can', 'hardly say of the poet what Homer says of Pedasus--', '', '[Greek: Os kai thnaetos eon, epeth ippois athanatoisi.]', '', 'He was _not_, although a mortal, able to keep up with the immortal', 'coursers. His path was on the plains or table-lands of earth--never or', 'seldom in ""cloudland, gorgeous land,"" or through the aerial altitudes', 'which stretch away and above the clouds to the gates of heaven. He can', 'hardly be said to have possessed the power of sublimity, in the high', 'sense of that term, as the power of sympathising with the feeling of the', 'Infinite. Often he gives us the impression of the picturesque, of the', 'beautiful, of the heroic, of the nobly disdainful--but never (when', 'writing, at least, entirely from his own mind) of that infinite and', 'nameless grandeur which the imaginative soul feels shed on it from the', 'multitudinous waves of ocean--from the cataract leaping from his rock,', 'as if to consummate an act of prayer to God--from the hum of great', 'assemblies of men--from the sight of far-extended wastes and', 'wildernesses--and from the awful silence, and the still more mysterious', 'sparkle of the midnight stars. This sense of the presence of the', '_shadow_ of immensity--immensity itself cannot be felt any more than', 'measured--this sight like that vouchsafed to Moses of the ""backparts"" of', 'the Divine--the Divine itself cannot be seen--has been the inspiration', 'of all the highest poetry of the world--of the ""Paradise Lost,"" of the', '""Divina Commedia,"" of the ""Night Thoughts,"" of Wordsworth and Coleridge,', 'of ""Festus,"" and, highest far, of the Hebrew Prophets, as they cry,', '""Whither can we go from Thy presence? whither can we flee from Thy', 'Spirit?"" Such poets have resembled a blind man, who feels, although he', 'cannot see, that a stranger of commanding air is in the room beside him;', 'so they stand awe-struck in the ""wind of the going"" of a majestic and', 'unseen Being. This feeling differs from mysticism, inasmuch as it is', 'connected with a reality, while the mystic dreams a vague and', 'unsupported dream, and the poetry it produces is simply the irresistible', 'cry springing from the perception of this wondrous Some One who is', 'actually near them.

Yet whatever dishonourable epithets may be launched against him everywhere, nobody defends his wretched honour. Call him a rogue, an infamous wretch, a confounded scoundrel if you like, all the world will say “yea, ” and no one contradicts you. But for all that, his bowing and scraping are welcome everywhere; he is received, smiled upon, and wriggles himself into all kinds of society; and, if any appointment is to be secured by intriguing, he will carry the day over a man of the greatest worth.

Whether', 'he discusses the deep questions of fate and foreknowledge in ""Religio', 'Laici,"" or lashes Shaftesbury in the ""Medal,"" or pours a torrent of', 'contempt on Shadwell in ""MacFlecknoe,"" or describes the fire of London', 'in the ""Annus Mirabilis,"" or soars into lyric enthusiasm in his ""Ode on', 'the Death of Mrs Killigrew,"" and ""Alexander\'s Feast,"" or paints a', 'tournament in ""Palamon and Arcite,"" or a fairy dance in the ""Flower and', 'the Leaf,""--he is always at home, and always aware that he is. His', 'consciousness of his own powers amounts to exultation. He is like the', 'steed who glories in that tremendous gallop which affects the spectator', ""with fear. Indeed, we never can separate our conception of Dryden's"", 'vigorous and vaulting style from the image of a noble horse, devouring', 'the dust of the field, clearing obstacles at a bound, taking up long', 'leagues as a little thing, and the very strength and speed of whose', 'motion give it at a distance the appearance of smoothness. Pope speaks', 'of his', '', '""Long resounding march, and energy divine.""', '', 'Perhaps ""_ease_ divine"" had been words more characteristic of that', 'almost superhuman power of language by which he makes the most obstinate', 'materials pliant, melts down difficulties as if by the touch of magic,', 'and, to resume the former figure, comes into the goal without a hair', 'turned on his mane, or a single sweat-drop confessing effort or', 'extraordinary exertion. We know no poet since Homer who can be compared', 'to Dryden in this respect, except Scott, who occasionally, in ""Marmion,""', 'and the ""Lay of the Last Minstrel,"" exhibits the same impetuous ease and', 'fiery fluent movement. Scott does not, however, in general, carry the', 'same weight as the other; and the species of verse he uses, in', 'comparison to the heroic rhyme of Dryden, gives you often the impression', 'of a hard trot, rather than of a ""long-resounding"" and magnificent', 'gallop. Scott exhibits in his poetry the soul of a warrior; but it is of', 'a warrior of the Border--somewhat savage and coarse. Dryden can, for the', 'nonce at least, assume the appearance, and display the spirit, of a', 'knight of ancient chivalry--gallant, accomplished, elegant, and gay.', '', ""Next to this poet's astonishing ease, spirit, and elastic vigour, may be"", 'ranked his clear, sharp intellect. He may be called more a logician than', 'a poet. He reasons often, and always acutely, and his rhyme, instead of', 'shackling, strengthens the movement of his argumentation. Parts of his', '""Religio Laici"" and the ""Hind and Panther"" resemble portions of Duns', 'Scotus or Aquinas set on fire. Indeed, keen, strong intellect, inflamed', 'with passion, and inspirited by that ""ardour and impetuosity of mind""', 'which Wordsworth is compelled to allow to him, rather than creative or', 'original genius, is the differentia of Dryden. We have compared him to a', 'courser, but he was not one of those coursers of Achilles, who fed on no', 'earthly food, but on the golden barley of heaven, having sprung from the', 'gods--', '', '  [Greek: Xanthon kai Balion, to ama pnoiaesi, petesthaen.', '  Tous eteke Zephuro anemo Arpua Podargae.]', '', 'Dryden resembled rather the mortal steed which was yoked with these', 'immortal twain, the brood of Zephyr and the Harpy Podarga; only we can', 'hardly say of the poet what Homer says of Pedasus--', '', '[Greek: Os kai thnaetos eon, epeth ippois athanatoisi.]', '', 'He was _not_, although a mortal, able to keep up with the immortal', 'coursers. His path was on the plains or table-lands of earth--never or', 'seldom in ""cloudland, gorgeous land,"" or through the aerial altitudes', 'which stretch away and above the clouds to the gates of heaven. He can', 'hardly be said to have possessed the power of sublimity, in the high', 'sense of that term, as the power of sympathising with the feeling of the', 'Infinite. Often he gives us the impression of the picturesque, of the', 'beautiful, of the heroic, of the nobly disdainful--but never (when', 'writing, at least, entirely from his own mind) of that infinite and', 'nameless grandeur which the imaginative soul feels shed on it from the', 'multitudinous waves of ocean--from the cataract leaping from his rock,', 'as if to consummate an act of prayer to God--from the hum of great', 'assemblies of men--from the sight of far-extended wastes and', 'wildernesses--and from the awful silence, and the still more mysterious', 'sparkle of the midnight stars. This sense of the presence of the', '_shadow_ of immensity--immensity itself cannot be felt any more than', 'measured--this sight like that vouchsafed to Moses of the ""backparts"" of', 'the Divine--the Divine itself cannot be seen--has been the inspiration', 'of all the highest poetry of the world--of the ""Paradise Lost,"" of the', '""Divina Commedia,"" of the ""Night Thoughts,"" of Wordsworth and Coleridge,', 'of ""Festus,"" and, highest far, of the Hebrew Prophets, as they cry,', '""Whither can we go from Thy presence? whither can we flee from Thy', 'Spirit?"" Such poets have resembled a blind man, who feels, although he', 'cannot see, that a stranger of commanding air is in the room beside him;', 'so they stand awe-struck in the ""wind of the going"" of a majestic and', 'unseen Being. This feeling differs from mysticism, inasmuch as it is', 'connected with a reality, while the mystic dreams a vague and', 'unsupported dream, and the poetry it produces is simply the irresistible', 'cry springing from the perception of this wondrous Some One who is', 'actually near them. The feeling is connected, in general, with a lofty', 'moral and religious nature; and yet not always, since, while wanting in', 'Dryden, we find it intensely discovered, although in an imperfect and', 'perverted shape, in By']"

Whether', 'he discusses the deep questions of fate and foreknowledge in ""Religio', 'Laici,"" or lashes Shaftesbury in the ""Medal,"" or pours a torrent of', 'contempt on Shadwell in ""MacFlecknoe,"" or describes the fire of London', 'in the ""Annus Mirabilis,"" or soars into lyric enthusiasm in his ""Ode on', 'the Death of Mrs Killigrew,"" and ""Alexander\'s Feast,"" or paints a', 'tournament in ""Palamon and Arcite,"" or a fairy dance in the ""Flower and', 'the Leaf,""--he is always at home, and always aware that he is. His', 'consciousness of his own powers amounts to exultation. He is like the', 'steed who glories in that tremendous gallop which affects the spectator', ""with fear. Indeed, we never can separate our conception of Dryden's"", 'vigorous and vaulting style from the image of a noble horse, devouring', 'the dust of the field, clearing obstacles at a bound, taking up long', 'leagues as a little thing, and the very strength and speed of whose', 'motion give it at a distance the appearance of smoothness. Pope speaks', 'of his', '', '""Long resounding march, and energy divine.""', '', 'Perhaps ""_ease_ divine"" had been words more characteristic of that', 'almost superhuman power of language by which he makes the most obstinate', 'materials pliant, melts down difficulties as if by the touch of magic,', 'and, to resume the former figure, comes into the goal without a hair', 'turned on his mane, or a single sweat-drop confessing effort or', 'extraordinary exertion. We know no poet since Homer who can be compared', 'to Dryden in this respect, except Scott, who occasionally, in ""Marmion,""', 'and the ""Lay of the Last Minstrel,"" exhibits the same impetuous ease and', 'fiery fluent movement. Scott does not, however, in general, carry the', 'same weight as the other; and the species of verse he uses, in', 'comparison to the heroic rhyme of Dryden, gives you often the impression', 'of a hard trot, rather than of a ""long-resounding"" and magnificent', 'gallop. Scott exhibits in his poetry the soul of a warrior; but it is of', 'a warrior of the Border--somewhat savage and coarse. Dryden can, for the', 'nonce at least, assume the appearance, and display the spirit, of a', 'knight of ancient chivalry--gallant, accomplished, elegant, and gay.', '', ""Next to this poet's astonishing ease, spirit, and elastic vigour, may be"", 'ranked his clear, sharp intellect.

Parts of his', '""Religio Laici"" and the ""Hind and Panther"" resemble portions of Duns', 'Scotus or Aquinas set on fire. Indeed, keen, strong intellect, inflamed', 'with passion, and inspirited by that ""ardour and impetuosity of mind""', 'which Wordsworth is compelled to allow to him, rather than creative or', 'original genius, is the differentia of Dryden. We have compared him to a', 'courser, but he was not one of those coursers of Achilles, who fed on no', 'earthly food, but on the golden barley of heaven, having sprung from the', 'gods--', '', '  [Greek: Xanthon kai Balion, to ama pnoiaesi, petesthaen.', '  Tous eteke Zephuro anemo Arpua Podargae.]', '', 'Dryden resembled rather the mortal steed which was yoked with these', 'immortal twain, the brood of Zephyr and the Harpy Podarga; only we can', 'hardly say of the poet what Homer says of Pedasus--', '', '[Greek: Os kai thnaetos eon, epeth ippois athanatoisi.]', '', 'He was _not_, although a mortal, able to keep up with the immortal', 'coursers. His path was on the plains or table-lands of earth--never or', 'seldom in ""cloudland, gorgeous land,"" or through the aerial altitudes', 'which stretch away and above the clouds to the gates of heaven. He can', 'hardly be said to have possessed the power of sublimity, in the high', 'sense of that term, as the power of sympathising with the feeling of the', 'Infinite. Often he gives us the impression of the picturesque, of the', 'beautiful, of the heroic, of the nobly disdainful--but never (when', 'writing, at least, entirely from his own mind) of that infinite and', 'nameless grandeur which the imaginative soul feels shed on it from the', 'multitudinous waves of ocean--from the cataract leaping from his rock,', 'as if to consummate an act of prayer to God--from the hum of great', 'assemblies of men--from the sight of far-extended wastes and', 'wildernesses--and from the awful silence, and the still more mysterious', 'sparkle of the midnight stars. This sense of the presence of the', '_shadow_ of immensity--immensity itself cannot be felt any more than', 'measured--this sight like that vouchsafed to Moses of the ""backparts"" of', 'the Divine--the Divine itself cannot be seen--has been the inspiration', 'of all the highest poetry of the world--of the ""Paradise Lost,"" of the', '""Divina Commedia,"" of the ""Night Thoughts,"" of Wordsworth and Coleridge,', 'of ""Festus,"" and, highest far, of the Hebrew Prophets, as they cry,', '""Whither can we go from Thy presence? whither can we flee from Thy', 'Spirit?"" Such poets have resembled a blind man, who feels, although he', 'cannot see, that a stranger of commanding air is in the room beside him;', 'so they stand awe-struck in the ""wind of the going"" of a majestic and', 'unseen Being. This feeling differs from mysticism, inasmuch as it is', 'connected with a reality, while the mystic dreams a vague and', 'unsupported dream, and the poetry it produces is simply the irresistible', 'cry springing from the perception of this wondrous Some One who is', 'actually near them.

Whether', 'he discusses the deep questions of fate and foreknowledge in ""Religio', 'Laici,"" or lashes Shaftesbury in the ""Medal,"" or pours a torrent of', 'contempt on Shadwell in ""MacFlecknoe,"" or describes the fire of London', 'in the ""Annus Mirabilis,"" or soars into lyric enthusiasm in his ""Ode on', 'the Death of Mrs Killigrew,"" and ""Alexander\'s Feast,"" or paints a', 'tournament in ""Palamon and Arcite,"" or a fairy dance in the ""Flower and', 'the Leaf,""--he is always at home, and always aware that he is. His', 'consciousness of his own powers amounts to exultation. He is like the', 'steed who glories in that tremendous gallop which affects the spectator', ""with fear. Indeed, we never can separate our conception of Dryden's"", 'vigorous and vaulting style from the image of a noble horse, devouring', 'the dust of the field, clearing obstacles at a bound, taking up long', 'leagues as a little thing, and the very strength and speed of whose', 'motion give it at a distance the appearance of smoothness.

Parts of his', '""Religio Laici"" and the ""Hind and Panther"" resemble portions of Duns', 'Scotus or Aquinas set on fire. Indeed, keen, strong intellect, inflamed', 'with passion, and inspirited by that ""ardour and impetuosity of mind""', 'which Wordsworth is compelled to allow to him, rather than creative or', 'original genius, is the differentia of Dryden. We have compared him to a', 'courser, but he was not one of those coursers of Achilles, who fed on no', 'earthly food, but on the golden barley of heaven, having sprung from the', 'gods--', '', '  [Greek: Xanthon kai Balion, to ama pnoiaesi, petesthaen.', '  Tous eteke Zephuro anemo Arpua Podargae.]', '', 'Dryden resembled rather the mortal steed which was yoked with these', 'immortal twain, the brood of Zephyr and the Harpy Podarga; only we can', 'hardly say of the poet what Homer says of Pedasus--', '', '[Greek: Os kai thnaetos eon, epeth ippois athanatoisi.]', '', 'He was _not_, although a mortal, able to keep up with the immortal', 'coursers. His path was on the plains or table-lands of earth--never or', 'seldom in ""cloudland, gorgeous land,"" or through the aerial altitudes', 'which stretch away and above the clouds to the gates of heaven. He can', 'hardly be said to have possessed the power of sublimity, in the high', 'sense of that term, as the power of sympathising with the feeling of the', 'Infinite. Often he gives us the impression of the picturesque, of the', 'beautiful, of the heroic, of the nobly disdainful--but never (when', 'writing, at least, entirely from his own mind) of that infinite and', 'nameless grandeur which the imaginative soul feels shed on it from the', 'multitudinous waves of ocean--from the cataract leaping from his rock,', 'as if to consummate an act of prayer to God--from the hum of great', 'assemblies of men--from the sight of far-extended wastes and', 'wildernesses--and from the awful silence, and the still more mysterious', 'sparkle of the midnight stars. This sense of the presence of the', '_shadow_ of immensity--immensity itself cannot be felt any more than', 'measured--this sight like that vouchsafed to Moses of the ""backparts"" of', 'the Divine--the Divine itself cannot be seen--has been the inspiration', 'of all the highest poetry of the world--of the ""Paradise Lost,"" of the', '""Divina Commedia,"" of the ""Night Thoughts,"" of Wordsworth and Coleridge,', 'of ""Festus,"" and, highest far, of the Hebrew Prophets, as they cry,', '""Whither can we go from Thy presence? whither can we flee from Thy', 'Spirit?"" Such poets have resembled a blind man, who feels, although he', 'cannot see, that a stranger of commanding air is in the room beside him;', 'so they stand awe-struck in the ""wind of the going"" of a majestic and', 'unseen Being. This feeling differs from mysticism, inasmuch as it is', 'connected with a reality, while the mystic dreams a vague and', 'unsupported dream, and the poetry it produces is simply the irresistible', 'cry springing from the perception of this wondrous Some One who is', 'actually near them. The feeling is connected, in general, with a lofty', 'moral and religious nature; and yet not always, since, while wanting in', 'Dryden, we find it intensely discovered, although in an imperfect and', 'perverted shape, in By']"
134,1590,the faerie queen ,0,"Who travels by the wearie wandring way, To come unto his wished home in haste, And meetes a flood, that doth his passage stay, Is not great grace to helpe him over past, Or free his feet, that in the myre sticke fast? Most envious man, that grieves at neighbours good, And fond, that joyest in the woe thou hast, Why wilt not let him passe, that long hath stood Upon the banke, yet wilt thy selfe not passe the flood"
133,1590,The faeire queen,0,"What franticke fit (quoth he) hath thus distraught Thee, foolish man, so rash a doome to give? What justice ever other judgement taught, But he should die, who merites not to live? None else to death this man despayring drive, But his owne guiltie mind deserving death. Is then unjust to each his due to give? Or let him die, that loatheth living breath? Or let him die at ease, that liveth here uneath?"
