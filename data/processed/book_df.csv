You might almost as readily find a hart on Harthope, or a wild', 'cat at Catslack, or a wolf at Wolf-Cleugh, as catch three stone-weight of', 'trout in Meggat-water. {6}  The days of guileless fish and fabulous', 'draughts of trout are over.  No sportsman need take three large baskets', 'to the Gala now, as Lauder did, and actually filled them with thirty-six', 'dozen of trout.  The modern angler must not allow his expectations to be', 'raised too highly by these stories.  Sport has become much more difficult', 'in these times of rapidly growing population.  It is a pleasant sight to', 'see the weavers spending their afternoons beside the Tweed; it is such a', 'sight as could not be witnessed by the closely preserved rivers of', 'England.  But the weavers have taught the trout caution, and the dyes and', 'various pollutions of trade have thinned their numbers.  Mr. Ruskin sees', 'no hope in this state of things; he preaches, in the spirit of old', 'Hesiod, that there is no piety in a race which defiles the ""holy waters.""', 'But surely civilization, even if it spoil sport and degrade scenery, is', 'better than a state of things in which the laird would hang up his foes', 'to an iron ring in the roof.  The hill of Cowden Knowes may be a less', ""eligible place for lovers' meetings than it was of old.

It may not be pleasant to find blue dye and wool yarn', 'in Teviot, but it is more endurable than to have to encounter the bandit', 'Barnskill, who hewed his bed of flint, Scott says, in Minto Crags.  Still,', 'the reading of the ""Rivers of Scotland"" leaves rather a sad impression on', 'the reader, and makes him ask once more if there is no way of reconciling', 'the beauty of rude ages with the comforts and culture of civilization.', 'This is a question that really demands an answer, though it is often put', 'in a mistaken way.  The teachings of Mr. Ruskin and of his followers', 'would bring us back to a time when printing was not, and an engineer', 'would have been burned for a wizard. {8}  But there is a point at which', 'civilization and production must begin to respect the limits of the', 'beautiful, on which they so constantly encroach.  Who is to settle the', 'limit, and escape the charge of being either a _dilettante_ and a', 'sentimentalist on the one hand, or a Philistine on the other?', '', '', '', 'SALMON-FISHING.', '', '', 'Salmon-fishing for this season is over, and, in spite of the fresh and', 'open weather, most anglers will feel that the time has come to close the', 'fly-book, to wind up the reel, and to consign the rod to its winter', 'quarters.  Salmon-fishing ceases to be very enjoyable when the _snaw', 'broo_, or melted snow from the hilltops, begins to mix with the brown', 'waters of Tweed or Tay; when the fallen leaves hamper the hook; and when', 'the fish are becoming sluggish, black, and the reverse of comely.  Now', 'the season of retrospect commences, the time of the pleasures of memory,', 'and the delights of talking shop dear to anglers Most sporting talk is', 'dull to every one but the votaries of the particular amusement.  Few', 'things can be drearier to the outsider than the conversation of', 'cricketers, unless it be the recondite lore which whist-players bring', 'forth from the depths of their extraordinary memories.  But angling talk', 'has a variety, recounts an amount of incident and adventure, and wakens a', 'feeling of free air in a way with which the records of no other sport,', 'except perhaps deer-stalking, can compete.  The salmon is, beyond all', 'rivalry, the strongest and most beautiful, and most cautious and artful,', 'of fresh-water fishes.  To capture him is not a task for slack muscles or', 'an uncertain eye.  There is even a slight amount of personal risk in the', 'sport.  The fisher must often wade till the water reaches above the waist', 'in cold and rushing streams, where his feet are apt to slip on the smooth', 'stones or trip on the rough rocks beneath him.  When the salmon takes the', 'fly, there is no time for picking steps.  The line rushes out so swiftly', 'as to cut the fingers if it touches them, and then is the moment when the', 'angler must follow the fish at the top of his speed.  To stand still, or', 'to go cautiously in pursuit, is to allow the salmon to run out with an', 'enormous length of line; the line is submerged--technically speaking,', '_drowned_--in the water, the strain of the supple rod is removed from the', 'fish, who finds the hook loose in his mouth, and rubs it off against the', 'bottom of the river.  Thus speed of foot, in water or over rocks, is a', 'necessary quality in the angler; at least in the northern angler.  By the', 'banks of the Usk a contemplative man who likes to take things easily may', 'find pretty sure footing on grassy slopes, or on a gravelly bottom.  But', 'it is a different thing to hook a large salmon where the Tweed foams', 'under the bridge of Yair down to the narrows and linns below.  If the', 'angler hesitates there, he is lost.  Does he stand still and give the', 'fish line?  The astute creature cuts it against the sharp rocks below the', 'bridge, and the rod, relieved of the weight, leaps straight in the', ""fisher's hand, and in his heart there is a sense of emptiness and sudden"", 'desolation.  Does he try to follow, the chances are that his feet slip;', 'after one or two wild struggles he is on his back in the water, and', 'nearly strangled with his fishing-basket.  In either case the fish goes', 'on his way rejoicing, and, after the manner of his kind, leaps out of the', 'water once or twice--a maddening sight.', '', 'Adventures like this are among the bitter memories of the angler.  The', 'fish that break away are monstrous animals; imagination increases their', 'bulk, and fond desire paints them clean-run a']"

But', 'even at the risk of talking shop, an honest playwright should take at', 'least one opportunity of acknowledging that his art is not only limited', 'by the art of the actor, but often stimulated and developed by it. No', 'sane and skilled author writes plays that present impossibilities to', 'the actor or to the stage engineer. If, as occasionally happens, he asks', 'them to do things that they have never done before and cannot conceive', 'as presentable or possible (as Wagner and Thomas Hardy have done,', 'for example), it is always found that the difficulties are not really', 'insuperable, the author having foreseen unsuspected possibilities both', 'in the actor and in the audience, whose will-to-make-believe can perform', 'the quaintest miracles. Thus may authors advance the arts of acting and', 'of staging plays. But the actor also may enlarge the scope of the drama', 'by displaying powers not previously discovered by the author. If the', 'best available actors are only Horatios, the authors will have to', 'leave Hamlet out, and be content with Horatios for heroes.

Indeed the actor often influences the author too', 'much; for I can remember a time (I am not implying that it is yet wholly', 'past) when the art of writing a fashionable play had become very', 'largely the art of writing it ""round"" the personalities of a group of', 'fashionable performers of whom Burbage would certainly have said that', 'their parts needed no acting. Everything has its abuse as well as its', 'use.', '', 'It is also to be considered that great plays live longer than great', 'actors, though little plays do not live nearly so long as the worst of', 'their exponents. The consequence is that the great actor, instead of', 'putting pressure on contemporary authors to supply him with heroic', 'parts, falls back on the Shakespearean repertory, and takes what he', 'needs from a dead hand. In the nineteenth century, the careers of Kean,', 'Macready, Barry Sullivan, and Irving, ought to have produced a group of', 'heroic plays comparable in intensity to those of Aeschylus, Sophocles,', 'and Euripides; but nothing of the kind happened: these actors played', 'the works of dead authors, or, very occasionally, of live poets who', 'were hardly regular professional playwrights. Sheridan Knowles, Bulwer', 'Lytton, Wills, and Tennyson produced a few glaringly artificial high', 'horses for the great actors of their time; but the playwrights proper,', 'who really kept the theatre going, and were kept going by the theatre,', 'did not cater for the great actors: they could not afford to compete', 'with a bard who was not for an age but for all time, and who had,', 'moreover, the overwhelming attraction for the actor-managers of not', ""charging author's fees. The result was that the playwrights and the"", 'great actors ceased to think of themselves as having any concern with', 'one another: Tom Robertson, Ibsen, Pinero, and Barrie might as well have', 'belonged to a different solar system as far as Irving was concerned; and', 'the same was true of their respective predecessors.', '', 'Thus was established an evil tradition; but I at least can plead that', 'it does not always hold good.

Since 1832, when Cuvier died, not only a new world,', 'but new worlds, of ancient life have been discovered; and those who', 'have most faithfully carried on the work of the chief founder of', 'palaeontology have done most to invalidate the essentially negative', 'grounds of his speculative adherence to tradition.', '', ""If Mr. Gladstone's latest information on these matters is derived"", 'from the famous discourse prefixed to the ""Ossemens Fossiles,"" I', 'can understand the position he has taken up; if he has ever opened a', 'respectable modern manual of palaeontology, or geology, I cannot.', 'For the facts which demolish his whole argument are of the commonest', 'notoriety.

And I', 'presume that it will be agreed that whales and porpoises, sea fishes,', 'and the innumerable hosts of marine invertebrated animals, are meant', 'thereby.

I suppose I may', 'take it for granted that by ""fowl"" we have here to understand birds--at', 'any rate primarily. Secondarily, it may be that the bats and the extinct', 'pterodactyles, which were flying reptiles, come under the same head.', 'But whether all insects are ""creeping things"" of the land-population,', 'or whether flying insects are to be included under the denomination of', '""winged fowl,"" is a point for the decision of Hebrew exegetes. Lastly,', 'I suppose I may assume that ""land-population"" signifies ""the cattle"" and', '""the beasts of the earth,"" and ""every creeping thing that creepeth upon', 'the earth,"" in verses 25 and 26; presumably it comprehends all kinds of', 'terrestrial animals, vertebrate and invertebrate, except such as may be', 'comprised under the head of the ""air-population.""', '', 'Now what I want to make clear is this: that if the terms', '""water-population,"" ""air-population,"" and ""land-population"" are', 'understood in the senses here defined, natural science has nothing to', 'say in favour of the proposition that they succeeded one another in', 'the order given by Mr. Gladstone; but that, on the contrary, all the', 'evidence we possess goes to prove that they did not.

The precious piece of furniture which on the Atlantic', 'voyage is trusted never to flinch among universal concussions was', 'emblazoned simply with his title and name.  It happened, however,', 'that the blazonry was huge; the back of the chair was covered with', 'enormous German characters.  This time there can be no doubt:  it', 'was modesty that caused the secretary of legation, in placing', 'himself, to turn this portion of his seat outward, away from the', 'eyes of his companions--to present it to the balustrade of the deck.', 'The ship was passing the Needles--the beautiful uttermost point of', 'the Isle of Wight.

Nor was the development of the steam', 'locomotive the result of any sudden discovery of steam. Steam, and', 'something of the mechanical possibilities of steam, had been known for', 'two thousand years; it had been used for pumping water, opening doors,', 'and working toys, before the Christian era. It may be urged that this', 'advance was the outcome of that new and more systematic handling of', 'knowledge initiated by Lord Bacon and sustained by the Royal Society;', 'but this does not appear to have been the case, though no doubt the new', 'habits of mind that spread outward from that centre played their part.', 'The men whose names are cardinal in the history of this development', ""invented, for the most part, in a quite empirical way, and Trevithick's"", ""engine was running along its rails and Evan's boat was walloping up the"", 'Hudson a quarter of a century before Carnot expounded his general', 'proposition. There were no such deductions from principles to', 'application as occur in the story of electricity to justify our', 'attribution of the steam engine to the scientific impulse. Nor does this', 'particular invention seem to have been directly due to the new', 'possibilities of reducing, shaping, and casting iron, afforded by the', 'substitution of coal for wood in iron works; through the greater', 'temperature afforded by a coal fire. In China coal has been used in the', 'reduction of iron for many centuries. No doubt these new facilities did', 'greatly help the steam engine in its invasion of the field of common', 'life, but quite certainly they were not sufficient to set it going. It', 'was, indeed, not one cause, but a very complex and unprecedented series', 'of causes, that set the steam locomotive going. It was indirectly, and', 'in another way, that the introduction of coal became the decisive', 'factor. One peculiar condition of its production in England seems to', 'have supplied just one ingredient that had been missing for two thousand', 'years in the group of conditions that were necessary before the steam', 'locomotive could appear.', '', 'This missing ingredient was a demand for some comparatively simple,', 'profitable machine, upon which the elementary principles of steam', 'utilization could be worked out. If one studies Stephenson\'s ""Rocket"" in', 'detail, as one realizes its profound complexity, one begins to', 'understand how impossible it would have been for that structure to have', 'come into existence _de novo_, however urgently the world had need of', 'it. But it happened that the coal needed to replace the dwindling', 'forests of this small and exceptionally rain-saturated country occurs in', 'low hollow basins overlying clay, and not, as in China and the', 'Alleghanies for example, on high-lying outcrops, that can be worked as', 'chalk is worked in England. From this fact it followed that some quite', 'unprecedented pumping appliances became necessary, and the thoughts of', 'practical men were turned thereby to the long-neglected possibilities of', 'steam. Wind was extremely inconvenient for the purpose of pumping,', 'because in these latitudes it is inconstant: it was costly, too, because', ""at any time the labourers might be obliged to sit at the pit's mouth for"", 'weeks together, whistling for a gale or waiting for the water to be got', 'under again. But steam had already been used for pumping upon one or two', 'estates in England--rather as a toy than in earnest--before the middle', 'of the seventeenth century, and the attempt to employ it was so obvious', 'as to be practically unavoidable.[3] The water trickling into the coal', 'measures[4] acted, therefore, like water trickling upon chemicals that', 'have long been mixed together dry and inert. Immediately the latent', 'reactions were set going. Savery, Newcomen, a host of other workers,', 'culminating in Watt, working always by steps that were at least so', 'nearly obvious as to give rise again and again to simultaneous', 'discoveries, changed this toy of steam into a real, a commercial thing,', 'developed a trade in pumping engines, created foundries and a new art of', 'engineering, and almost unconscious of what they were doing, made the', 'steam locomotive a well-nigh unavoidable consequence. At last, after a', 'century of improvement on pumping engines, there remained nothing but', 'the very obvious stage of getting the engine that had been developed on', 'wheels and out upon the ways of the world.', '', 'Ever and again during the eighteenth century an engine would be put upon', 'the roads and pronounced a failure--one monstrous PalÃ¦oferric creature', 'was visible on a French high road as early as 1769--but by the dawn of', 'the nineteenth century the problem had very nearly got itself solved. By', '1804 Trevithick had a steam locomotive indisputably in motion and almost', 'financially possible, and from his hands it puffed its way, slowly at', 'first, and then, under Stephenson, faster and faster, to a transitory', 'empire over the earth. It was a steam locomotive--but for all that it', 'was primarily _a steam engine for pumping_ adapted to a new end; it was', 'a steam engine whose ancestral stage had developed under conditions that', 'were by no means exacting in the matter of weight. And from that fact', 'followed a consequence that has hampered railway travel and transport', 'very greatly, and that is tolerated nowadays only through a belief in', 'its practical necessity. The steam locomotive was all too huge and heavy', 'for the high road--it had to be put upon rails. And so clearly linked', 'are steam engines and railways in our minds that, in common language', 'now, the latter implies the former. But indeed it is the result of', 'accidental impediments, of avoidable difficulties that we travel to-day', 'on rails.', '', 'Railway travelling is at best a compromise. The quite conceivable ideal', 'of locomotive convenience, so far as travellers are concerned, is surely', 'a highly mobile conveyance capable of travelling easily and swiftly to', 'any desired point, traversing, at a reasonably controlled pace, the', 'ordinary roads and streets, and having access for higher rates of speed', 'and long-distance travelling to sp']"

Now, being dark and fair respectively and', 'having lived in close association since childhood, Leonard and Jane, as', 'might be expected from the working of the laws of natural economy, had', 'gravitated towards each other with increasing speed ever since they had', 'come to understand the possibilities of the institution of marriage.', 'In the end thus mutual gravitation led to a shock and confusion of', 'individualities which was not without its charm; or, to put the matter', 'more plainly, Leonard proposed to Jane and had been accepted with many', 'blushes and some tears and kisses.', '', 'It was a common little romance enough, but, like everything else with', 'which youth and love are concerned, it had its elements of beauty.

First, there was the king. The', ""Censor is a member of his household retinue; and as a king's"", 'retinue has to be jealously guarded to avoid curtailment of the', 'royal state no matter what may be the function of the particular', 'retainer threatened, nothing but an express royal intimation to', 'the contrary, which is a constitutional impossibility, could have', 'relieved the Committee from the fear of displeasing the king by', 'any proposal to abolish the censorship of the Lord Chamberlain.', 'Now all the lords on the Committee and some of the commoners', 'could have been wiped out of society (in their sense of the word)', 'by the slightest intimation that the king would prefer not to', 'meet them; and this was a heavy risk to run on the chance of ""a', 'great and serious national drama"" ensuing on the removal of the', ""Lord Chamberlain's veto on Mrs Warren's Profession. Second, there"", 'was the Nonconformist conscience, holding the Liberal Government', 'responsible for the Committee it had appointed, and holding also,', 'to the extent of votes enough to turn the scale in some', 'constituencies, that the theatre is the gate of hell, to be', 'tolerated, as vice is tolerated, only because the power to', 'suppress it could not be given to any public body without too', 'serious an interference with certain Liberal traditions of', 'liberty which are still useful to Nonconformists in other', 'directions. Third, there was the commercial interest of the', 'theatrical managers and their syndicates of backers in the City,', 'to whom, as I shall shew later on, the censorship affords a cheap', 'insurance of enormous value. Fourth, there was the powerful', 'interest of the trade in intoxicating liquors, fiercely', 'determined to resist any extension of the authority of', 'teetotaller-led local governing bodies over theatres. Fifth,', 'there were the playwrights, without political power, but with a', 'very close natural monopoly of a talent not only for play-writing', 'but for satirical polemics. And since every interest has its', 'opposition, all these influences had created hostile bodies by', 'the operation of the mere impulse to contradict them, always', 'strong in English human nature.', '', '', 'WHY THE MANAGERS LOVE THE CENSORSHIP', '', 'The only one of these influences which seems to be generally', 'misunderstood is that of the managers. It has been assumed', 'repeatedly that managers and authors are affected in the same way', 'by the censorship. When a prominent author protests against the', 'censorship, his opinion is supposed to be balanced by that of', 'some prominent manager who declares that the censorship is the', 'mainstay of the theatre, and his relations with the Lord', 'Chamberlain and the Examiner of Plays a cherished privilege and', 'an inexhaustible joy. This error was not removed by the evidence', 'given before the Joint Select Committee. The managers did not', 'make their case clear there, partly because they did not', 'understand it, and partly because their most eminent witnesses', 'were not personally affected by it, and would not condescend to', 'plead it, feeling themselves, on the contrary, compelled by their', 'self-respect to admit and even emphasize the fact that the Lord', 'Chamberlain in the exercise of his duties as licenser had done', 'those things which he ought not to have done, and left undone', 'those things which he ought to have done. Mr Forbes Robertson and', 'Sir Herbert Tree, for instance, had never felt the real', 'disadvantage of which managers have to complain. This', 'disadvantage was not put directly to the Committee; and though', 'the managers are against me on the question of the censorship, I', 'will now put their case for them as they should have put it', 'themselves, and as it can be read between the lines of their', 'evidence when once the reader has the clue.', '', 'The manager of a theatre is a man of business.

The misery of Venice stands there for', 'all the world to see; it is part of the spectacle--a', 'thoroughgoing devotee of local colour might consistently say it', 'is part of the pleasure. The Venetian people have little to call', 'their own--little more than the bare privilege of leading their', 'lives in the most beautiful of towns. Their habitations are', 'decayed; their taxes heavy; their pockets light; their', 'opportunities few. One receives an impression, however, that life', 'presents itself to them with attractions not accounted for in', 'this meagre train of advantages, and that they are on better', 'terms with it than many people who have made a better bargain.', 'They lie in the sunshine; they dabble in the sea; they wear', 'bright rags; they fall into attitudes and harmonies; they assist', 'at an eternal _conversazione_. It is not easy to say that', 'one would have them other than they are, and it certainly would', 'make an immense difference should they be better fed. The number', 'of persons in Venice who evidently never have enough to eat is', 'painfully large; but it would be more painful if we did not', 'equally perceive that the rich Venetian temperament may bloom', ""upon a dog's allowance. Nature has been kind to it, and sunshine"", 'and leisure and conversation and beautiful views form the greater', 'part of its sustenance. It takes a great deal to make a', 'successful American, but to make a happy Venetian takes only a', 'handful of quick sensibility. The Italian people have at once the', 'good and the evil fortune to be conscious of few wants; so that', 'if the civilisation of a society is measured by the number of its', 'needs, as seems to be the common opinion to-day, it is to be', 'feared that the children of the lagoon would make but a poor', 'figure in a set of comparative tables. Not their misery,', 'doubtless, but the way they elude their misery, is what pleases', 'the sentimental tourist, who is gratified by the sight of a', 'beautiful race that lives by the aid of its imagination. The way', 'to enjoy Venice is to follow the example of these people and make', 'the most of simple pleasures. Almost all the pleasures of the', 'place are simple; this may be maintained even under the', 'imputation of ingenious paradox. There is no simpler pleasure', 'than looking at a fine Titian, unless it be looking at a fine', ""Tintoret or strolling into St. Mark's,--abominable the way one"", ""falls into the habit,--and resting one's light-wearied eyes upon"", 'the windowless gloom; or than floating in a gondola or than', ""hanging over a balcony or than taking one's coffee at Florian's."", 'It is of such superficial pastimes that a Venetian day is', 'composed, and the pleasure of the matter is in the emotions to', 'which they minister. These are fortunately of the finest--', 'otherwise Venice would be insufferably dull. Reading Ruskin is', 'good; reading the old records is perhaps better; but the best', 'thing of all is simply staying on. The only way to care for', 'Venice as she deserves it is to give her a chance to touch you', 'often--to linger and remain and return.', '', '', 'II', '', 'The danger is that you will not linger enough--a danger of which', 'the author of these lines had known something. It is possible to', 'dislike Venice, and to entertain the sentiment in a responsible', 'and intelligent manner. There are travellers who think the place', 'odious, and those who are not of this opinion often find', 'themselves wishing that the others were only more numerous. The', ""sentimental tourist's sole quarrel with his Venice is that he has"", 'too many competitors there. He likes to be alone; to be original;', 'to have (to himself, at least) the air of making discoveries. The', 'Venice of to-day is a vast museum where the little wicket that', 'admits you is perpetually turning and creaking, and you march', 'through the institution with a herd of fellow-gazers. There is', 'nothing left to discover or describe, and originality of attitude', 'is completely impossible. This is often very annoying; you can', 'only turn your back on your impertinent playfellow and curse his', 'want of delicacy. But this is not the fault of Venice; it is the', 'fault of the rest of the world. The fault of Venice is that,', 'though she is easy to admire, she is not so easy to live with as', 'you count living in other places. After you have stayed a week', 'and the bloom of novelty has rubbed off you wonder if you can', 'accommodate yourself to the peculiar conditions. Your old habits', 'become impracticable and you find yourself obliged to form new', 'ones of an undesirable and unprofitable character. You are tired', 'of your gondola (or you think you are) and you have seen all the', 'principal pictures and heard the names of the palaces announced a', 'dozen times by your gondolier, who brings them out almost as', 'impressively as if he were an English butler bawling titles into', 'a drawing-room. You have walked several hundred times round the', 'Piazza and bought several bushels of photographs. You have', 'visited the antiquity mongers whose horrible sign-boards', 'dishonour some of the grandest vistas in the Grand Canal; you', 'have tried the opera and found it very bad; you have bathed at', 'the Lido and found the water flat. You have begun to have a', 'shipboard-feeling--to regard the Piazza as an enormous saloon', 'and the Riva degli Schiavoni as a promenade-deck. You are', 'obstructed and encaged; your desire for space is unsatisfied; you', 'miss your usual exercise. You try to take a walk and you fail,', 'and meantime, as I say, you have come to regard your gondola as a', ""sort of magnified baby's cradle. You have no desire to be rocked"", 'to sleep, though you are sufficiently kept awake by the', 'irritation produced, as you gaze across the shallow lagoon, by', 'the attitude of the perpetual gondolier, with his turned-out', 'toes, his protruded chin, his absurdly unscientific stroke.

There are probably still Russians who believe that every', ""English gentleman puts a rope round his wife's neck and sells her in"", 'Smithfield. There are certainly still Englishmen who believe that every', ""Russian gentleman takes a rope to his wife's back and whips her every"", 'day. But these stories, picturesque and useful as they are, have a limit', 'to their use like everything else; and the limit consists in the fact', 'that they are not _true_, and that there necessarily exists a group of', 'persons who know they are not true. It is so with matters of fact about', 'which you asseverate so positively to us, as if they were matters of', 'opinion. Scarborough might be a fortress; but it is not. I happen to', 'know it is not. Mr. Morel may deserve to be universally admired in', 'England; but he is not universally admired in England. Tell the Russians', 'that he is by all means; but do not tell us. We have seen him; we have', 'also seen Scarborough. You should think of this before you speak.', '', ""Third, don't perpetually boast that you are cultured in language which"", 'proves that you are not. You claim to thrust yourself upon everybody on', 'the ground that you are stuffed with wit and wisdom, and have enough for', 'the whole world. But people who have wit enough for the whole world,', 'have wit enough for a whole newspaper paragraph. And you can seldom get', 'through even a whole paragraph without being monotonous, or irrelevant,', 'or unintelligible, or self-contradictory, or broken-minded generally. If', 'you have something to teach us, teach it to us now. If you propose to', 'convert us after you have conquered us, why not convert us before you', 'have conquered us? As it is, we cannot believe what you say about your', 'superior education because of the way in which you say it. If an', 'Englishman says, ""I don\'t make no mistakes in English, not me,"" we can', 'understand his remark; but we cannot endorse it. To say, ""Je parler le', 'Frenche language, non demi,"" is comprehensible, but not convincing. And', 'when you say, as you did in a recent appeal to the Americans, that the', 'Germanic Powers have sacrificed a great deal of ""red fluid"" in defence', 'of their culture, we point out to you that cultured people do not employ', 'such a literary style. Or when you say that the Belgians were so', ""ignorant as to think they were being butchered when they weren't, we"", 'only wonder whether _you_ are so ignorant as to think you are being', ""believed when you aren't. Thus, for instance, when you brag about"", 'burning Venice to express your contempt for ""tourists,"" we cannot think', ""much of the culture, as culture, which supposes St. Mark's to be a thing"", 'for tourists instead of historians. This, however, would be the least', 'part of our unfavourable judgment. That judgment is complete when we', 'have read such a paragraph as this, prominently displayed in a paper in', 'which you specially spread yourself: ""That the Italians have a perfect', 'knowledge of the fact that this city of antiquities and tourists is', 'subject, and rightly subject, to attack and bombardment, is proved by', 'the measures they took at the beginning of the war to remove some of', 'their greatest art treasures."" Now culture may or may not include the', 'power to admire antiquities, and to restrain oneself from the pleasure', 'of breaking them like toys. But culture does, presumably, include the', 'power to think. For less laborious intellects than your own it is', 'generally sufficient to think once. But if you will think twice or', 'twenty times, it cannot but dawn on you that there is something wrong in', 'the reasoning by which the placing of diamonds in a safe proves that', 'they are ""rightly subject"" to a burglar. The incessant assertion of such', 'things can do little to spread your superior culture; and if you say', 'them too often people may even begin to doubt whether you have any', 'superior culture after all.

As to that', 'one matter, from which arose some trouble, much will have to be said', 'as the story goes on.', '', 'The two girls were named Ada and Edith, and were, in form and figure,', 'very unlike each other.

She was black-haired, as had', ""been her mother's, and almost swarthy in her complexion, and there"", 'was a squareness about her chin which robbed her face of much of its', 'feminine softness. But her eyes were very bright, and when she would', 'laugh, or say something intended to make another laugh, her face', 'would be brightened up with fun, good-humour, or wit, in a manner', 'which enabled no one to call her plain.', '', 'Of the younger boy, Florian, much will be said as the story goes', 'on; but what can be said of a boy who is only ten which shall be', 'descriptive and also interesting?

So that it was now', 'understood that Florian Jones would follow his brother to Galway', 'College. Those who used to watch his ways would declare that the', 'professors of Galway College would have some trouble with him.', '', 'While the mother had lived no family had been more easily ruled than', ""that of the Jones's, but since her death some irregularities had gone"", 'on. The father had made a favourite of the younger boy, and thereby', 'had done mischief. The eldest son, too, had become proud of his', 'position, and an attempt had been made to check him with a hard hand;', 'and yet much in the absolute working of the farm had been left to', 'him. Then troubles had come, in which Mr. Jones would be sometimes', 'too severe, and sometimes too lenient. Of the girls it must be', 'acknowledged that they were to be blamed for no fault after the first', 'blow had come. Everyone at Morony had felt that the great blow had', 'been the death of the mistress. But it must be confessed that other', 'things had happened shortly afterwards which had tended to create', 'disturbance. One of the family had declared that he intended to', ""become a Roman Catholic. The Jones's had been Protestants, the father"", 'and mother having both come from England as Protestants. They were', 'not, therefore, Ultra-Protestants, as those will know who best', 'know Ireland. There had been no horror of a Catholic. According to', 'Mrs. Jones the way to heaven had been open to both Catholic and', 'Protestant, only it had suited her to say her prayers after the', 'Protestant fashion.

He had less of the appearance and more of the reality of culture', 'than the young Oxford diplomatist, for he had keener emotions though', 'less exact knowledge.  Miss Adams and Miss Sadie Adams were aunt and', 'niece, the former a little, energetic, hard-featured Bostonian old-maid,', 'with a huge surplus of unused love behind her stern and swarthy', 'features.

Who does not conclude, with Mr. Churchill, that ""a more', 'scientific, a more elaborate, a more comprehensive social', 'organisation"" is indispensable to our country if it is to continue its', 'march to greatness? Back or forward we must go.', '', 'Mr. Churchill, indeed, has thought it wise to raise the specific point', 'at which, in the process of seeking a finer use and adaptation of the', 'human material which forms society, the progressive and reforming', 'statesman parts company with the dogmatic Socialist. There is no need', 'to labour a distinction which arises from the nature and the', 'activities of the two forces. British Liberalism is both a mental', 'habit and a method of politics. Through both these characteristics it', 'is bound to criticise a State so long as in any degree it rests on the', 'principles of ""Penguin Island""--""respect for the rich and contempt for', 'the poor,"" and to modify or repeal the rights of property where they', 'clearly conflict with human rights. But its idealism and its practical', 'responsibilities forbid it to accept the elimination of private', 'enterprise and the assumption by the State of all the instruments of', 'production and distribution. Socialism has great power of emotional', 'and even religious appeal, of which it would be wise for Liberalism', 'to take account, and it is, on the whole, a beneficent force in', 'society. But as pure dogma it fits the spirit of man no more exactly', 'than the Shorter Catechism. As Mr. Churchill well says, both the', 'collectivist and the individualist principles have deep roots in human', 'life, and the statesman can ignore neither.', '', 'In the main, therefore, these speeches, with all their fresh', 'brilliancy of colouring and treatment, hold up the good old banner of', 'social progress, which we erect against reactionist and revolutionist', 'alike. The ""old Liberal"" will find the case for Free Trade, for peace,', 'for representative government, stated as powerfully and convincingly', 'as he could wish. Their actual newness consists in the fact that not', 'only do they open up to Liberalism what it always wants--a wide domain', 'of congenial thought and energy, but they offer it two propositions', 'which it can reject only at its peril. The first is that there can and', 'must be a deep, sharp abridgment of the sphere of industrial life', 'which has been marked out as hopeless, or as an inevitable part of the', 'social system.', '', 'Here the new Liberalism parts with _laissez-faire_, and those who', 'defend it. It assumes that the State must take in hand the problems', 'of industrial insecurity and unemployment, and must solve them. The', 'issue is vital. Protection has already made its bid. It will assure', 'the workman what is in his mind more than cheap food--namely, secure', 'wages; it affects to give him all his life, or nearly all his life, a', 'market for his labour so wide and so steady that the fear of forced', 'idleness will almost be banished from it. The promise is false.', 'Protection by itself has in no country annulled or seriously qualified', 'unemployment. But the need to which it appeals is absolutely real; for', 'the modern State it is a problem of the Sphinx, neither to be shirked', 'nor wrongly answered. And the alternative remedy offered in these', 'pages has already, as their author abundantly shows, succeeded even in', 'the very partial forms in which it has been applied. The labour market', 'can be steadied and equalised over a great industrial field. Part of', 'its surplus can be provided for. What Mr. Churchill calls ""diseased', 'industries"" can be cut off from the main body, or restored to some', 'measure of health. The State can set up a minimum standard of health', 'and wage, below which it will not allow its citizens to sink; it can', 'step in and dispense employment and restorative force under strictly', 'specified conditions, to a small body of more or less ""sick"" workers;', 'it can supply security for a far greater, less dependent, and more', 'efficient mass of labourers, in recurring crises of accident,', 'sickness, invalidity, and unemployment, and can do so with every hope', 'of enlisting in its service voluntary forces and individual virtues of', 'great value.', '', 'This is not a problem of ""relief,"" it is a method of humanity, and its', 'aim is not merely to increase the mechanical force of the State, but', 'to raise the average of character, of _morale_, in its citizens. Nor', 'do these speeches represent only a batch of platform promises. The', 'great scheme of social betterment preached in these pages is already', 'embodied in half a dozen Acts of Parliament, with corresponding', 'organisations in the Board of Trade and elsewhere; and if the Budget', 'passes, the crown can be put upon them next year or the year after by', 'measures of insurance against invalidity and unemployment.', '', ""Mr. Churchill's second proposition is the correlative of the first."", 'How shall this imposing fabric of industrial securit']"

Nor was the development of the steam', 'locomotive the result of any sudden discovery of steam. Steam, and', 'something of the mechanical possibilities of steam, had been known for', 'two thousand years; it had been used for pumping water, opening doors,', 'and working toys, before the Christian era. It may be urged that this', 'advance was the outcome of that new and more systematic handling of', 'knowledge initiated by Lord Bacon and sustained by the Royal Society;', 'but this does not appear to have been the case, though no doubt the new', 'habits of mind that spread outward from that centre played their part.', 'The men whose names are cardinal in the history of this development', ""invented, for the most part, in a quite empirical way, and Trevithick's"", ""engine was running along its rails and Evan's boat was walloping up the"", 'Hudson a quarter of a century before Carnot expounded his general', 'proposition. There were no such deductions from principles to', 'application as occur in the story of electricity to justify our', 'attribution of the steam engine to the scientific impulse. Nor does this', 'particular invention seem to have been directly due to the new', 'possibilities of reducing, shaping, and casting iron, afforded by the', 'substitution of coal for wood in iron works; through the greater', 'temperature afforded by a coal fire. In China coal has been used in the', 'reduction of iron for many centuries. No doubt these new facilities did', 'greatly help the steam engine in its invasion of the field of common', 'life, but quite certainly they were not sufficient to set it going. It', 'was, indeed, not one cause, but a very complex and unprecedented series', 'of causes, that set the steam locomotive going. It was indirectly, and', 'in another way, that the introduction of coal became the decisive', 'factor. One peculiar condition of its production in England seems to', 'have supplied just one ingredient that had been missing for two thousand', 'years in the group of conditions that were necessary before the steam', 'locomotive could appear.', '', 'This missing ingredient was a demand for some comparatively simple,', 'profitable machine, upon which the elementary principles of steam', 'utilization could be worked out. If one studies Stephenson\'s ""Rocket"" in', 'detail, as one realizes its profound complexity, one begins to', 'understand how impossible it would have been for that structure to have', 'come into existence _de novo_, however urgently the world had need of', 'it. But it happened that the coal needed to replace the dwindling', 'forests of this small and exceptionally rain-saturated country occurs in', 'low hollow basins overlying clay, and not, as in China and the', 'Alleghanies for example, on high-lying outcrops, that can be worked as', 'chalk is worked in England. From this fact it followed that some quite', 'unprecedented pumping appliances became necessary, and the thoughts of', 'practical men were turned thereby to the long-neglected possibilities of', 'steam. Wind was extremely inconvenient for the purpose of pumping,', 'because in these latitudes it is inconstant: it was costly, too, because', ""at any time the labourers might be obliged to sit at the pit's mouth for"", 'weeks together, whistling for a gale or waiting for the water to be got', 'under again. But steam had already been used for pumping upon one or two', 'estates in England--rather as a toy than in earnest--before the middle', 'of the seventeenth century, and the attempt to employ it was so obvious', 'as to be practically unavoidable.[3] The water trickling into the coal', 'measures[4] acted, therefore, like water trickling upon chemicals that', 'have long been mixed together dry and inert. Immediately the latent', 'reactions were set going. Savery, Newcomen, a host of other workers,', 'culminating in Watt, working always by steps that were at least so', 'nearly obvious as to give rise again and again to simultaneous', 'discoveries, changed this toy of steam into a real, a commercial thing,', 'developed a trade in pumping engines, created foundries and a new art of', 'engineering, and almost unconscious of what they were doing, made the', 'steam locomotive a well-nigh unavoidable consequence. At last, after a', 'century of improvement on pumping engines, there remained nothing but', 'the very obvious stage of getting the engine that had been developed on', 'wheels and out upon the ways of the world.', '', 'Ever and again during the eighteenth century an engine would be put upon', 'the roads and pronounced a failure--one monstrous PalÃ¦oferric creature', 'was visible on a French high road as early as 1769--but by the dawn of', 'the nineteenth century the problem had very nearly got itself solved. By', '1804 Trevithick had a steam locomotive indisputably in motion and almost', 'financially possible, and from his hands it puffed its way, slowly at', 'first, and then, under Stephenson, faster and faster, to a transitory', 'empire over the earth. It was a steam locomotive--but for all that it', 'was primarily _a steam engine for pumping_ adapted to a new end; it was', 'a steam engine whose ancestral stage had developed under conditions that', 'were by no means exacting in the matter of weight. And from that fact', 'followed a consequence that has hampered railway travel and transport', 'very greatly, and that is tolerated nowadays only through a belief in', 'its practical necessity. The steam locomotive was all too huge and heavy', 'for the high road--it had to be put upon rails. And so clearly linked', 'are steam engines and railways in our minds that, in common language', 'now, the latter implies the former. But indeed it is the result of', 'accidental impediments, of avoidable difficulties that we travel to-day', 'on rails.', '', 'Railway travelling is at best a compromise.

That the object of', 'this party is to reduce Englishmen and English ideas to a subordinate', 'position in the State, if not actually to rid itself of our rule and', 'establish a republic, there is no manner of doubt.

Of what nature were the crowds who were thus loud in the praise of', 'their great Consul, and as loud afterward in their rejoicings at the', 'return of the great exile, we must form our own opinion from', 'circumstantial evidence. There was a mass of people, with keen ears', 'taking artistic delight in eloquence and in personal graces, but', 'determined to be idle, and to be fed as well as amused in their', 'idleness; and there were also vast bands of men ready to fight--bands of', 'gladiators they have been called, though it is probable that but few of', 'them had ever been trained to the arena--whose business it was to shout', 'as well as to fight on behalf of their patrons. We shall not be', 'justified in supposing that those who on the two occasions named gave', 'their sweet voices for Cicero were only the well-ordered, though idle,', 'proportion of the people, whereas they who had voted against him in', 'favor of Clodius had all been assassins, bullies, and swordsmen.

But in the middle ages very little could', 'be done in the way of investments like these. There were no railroads,', 'and there was very little use for ships. There was no profit to be', 'gained by building houses and stores, for there were so many wars and', 'commotions among the people of the different towns and kingdoms, that', 'nothing was stable or safe.

I will assume that it made at least one', 'revolution during the first twenty-four hours.  Early the next', 'morning its position was marked, and it made a second revolution in 9', 'hrs.; during the latter part of this revolution it moved much', 'quicker, and the third circle was performed in the evening in a', 'little over 3 hrs.  As on the succeeding morning I found that the', 'shoot revolved in 2 hrs. 45 m., it must have made during the night', 'four revolutions, each at the average rate of a little over 3 hrs.  I', 'should add that the temperature of the room varied only a little.', 'The shoot had now grown 3.5 inches in length, and carried at its', 'extremity a young internode 1 inch in length, which showed slight', 'changes in its curvature.  The next or ninth revolution was effected', 'in 2 hrs. 30 m.  From this time forward, the revolutions were easily', 'observed.  The thirty-sixth revolution was performed at the usual', 'rate; so was the last or thirty-seventh, but it was not completed;', 'for the internode suddenly became upright, and after moving to the', 'centre, remained motionless.  I tied a weight to its upper end, so as', 'to bow it slightly and thus detect any movement; but there was none.', 'Some time before the last revolution was half performed, the lower', 'part of the internode ceased to move.', '', 'A few more remarks will complete all that need be said about this', 'internode.  It moved during five days; but the more rapid movements,', 'after the performance of the third revolution, lasted during three', 'days and twenty hours.  The regular revolutions, from the ninth to', 'thirty-sixth inclusive, were effected at the average rate of 2 hrs.', '31 m.; but the weather was cold, and this affected the temperature of', 'the room, especially during the night, and consequently retarded the', 'rate of movement a little.  There was only one irregular movement,', 'which consisted in the stem rapidly making, after an unusually slow', 'revolution, only the segment of a circle.  After the seventeenth', 'revolution the internode had grown from 1.75 to 6 inches in length,', 'and carried an internode 1.875 inch long, which was just perceptibly', 'moving; and this carried a very minute ultimate internode.  After the', 'twenty-first revolution, the penultimate internode was 2.5 inches', 'long, and probably revolved in a period of about three hours.  At the', 'twenty-seventh revolution the lower and still moving internode was', '8.375, the penultimate 3.5, and the ultimate 2.5 inches in length;', 'and the inclination of the whole shoot was such, that a circle 19', 'inches in diameter was swept by it.  When the movement ceased, the', 'lower internode was 9 inches, and the penultimate 6 inches in length;', 'so that, from the twenty-seventh to thirty-seventh revolutions', 'inclusive, three internodes were at the same time revolving.', '', 'The lower internode, when it ceased revolving, became upright and', 'rigid; but as the whole shoot was left to grow unsupported, it became', 'after a time bent into a nearly horizontal position, the uppermost', 'and growing internodes still revolving at the extremity, but of', 'course no longer round the old central point of the supporting stick.', 'From the changed position of the centre of gravity of the extremity,', 'as it revolved, a slight and slow swaying movement was given to the', 'long horizontally projecting shoot; and this movement I at first', 'thought was a spontaneous one.  As the shoot grew, it hung down more', 'and more, whilst the growing and revolving extremity turned itself up', 'more and more.', '', 'With the Hop we have seen that three internodes were at the same time', 'revolving; and this was the case with most of the plants observed by', 'me.  With all, if in full health, two internodes revolved; so that by', 'the time the lower one ceased to revolve, the one above was in full', 'action, with a terminal internode just commencing to move.  With Hoya', 'carnosa, on the other hand, a depending shoot, without any developed', 'leaves, 32 inches in length, and consisting of seven internodes (a', 'minute terminal one, an inch in length, being counted), continually,', 'but slowly, swayed from side to side in a semicircular course, with', 'the extreme internodes making complete revolutions.  This swaying', 'movement was certainly due to the movement of the lower internodes,', 'which, however, had not force sufficient to swing the whole shoot', 'round the central supporting stick.  The case of another', 'Asclepiadaceous plant, viz., Ceropegia Gardnerii, is worth briefly', 'giving.  I allowed the top to grow out almost horizontally to the', 'length of 31 inches; this now consisted of three long internodes,', 'terminated by two short ones.  The whole revolved in a course opposed', 'to the sun (the reverse of that of the Hop), at rates between 5 hrs.', '15 m. and 6 hrs. 45 m. for each revolution.  The extreme tip thus', 'made a circle of above 5 feet (or 62 inches) in diameter and 16 feet', 'in circumference, travelling at the rate of 32 or 33 inches per hour.', 'The weather being hot, the plant was allowed to stand on my study-', 'table; and it was an interesting spectacle to watch the long shoot', 'sweeping this grand circle, night and day, in search of some object', 'round which to twine.', '', 'If we take hold of a growing sapling, we can of course bend it to all', 'sides in succession, so as to make the tip describe a circle, like', 'that performed by the summit of a spontaneously revolving plant.  By', 'this movement the sapling is not in the least twisted round its own', 'axis.  I mention this because if a black point be painted on the', 'bark, on the side which is uppermost when the sapling is bent towards', ""the holder's body, as the circle is described, the black point"", 'gradually turns round and sinks to the lower side, and comes up again', 'when the circle is completed; and this gives the false appearance of', 'twisting, which, in the case of spontaneously revolving plants,', 'deceived me for a time.  The appearance is the more deceitful because', 'the ax']"

What is there', 'we ought to repent of? what is there we ought to amend?""', '', 'Well, my friends--it is just these very questions which I hope and', 'trust God will help me to answer to you, in my next few sermons--I am', 'perfectly convinced that we must get them answered and act upon them', 'speedily.  I am perfectly convinced that if we go on as most of us', 'are going in England now, the Lord of us all will come in an hour', 'when we are not aware, and cut us asunder in the deepest and most', 'real sense, as He came and cut asunder France, Germany, and Austria', 'only last year, and appoint us our portion with the unbelievers.  And', 'I believe that our punishment will be seven times as severe as that', 'of either France, Germany, or Austria, because we have had seven', 'times their privileges and blessings, seven times their Gospel light', 'and Christian knowledge, seven times their freedom and justice in', 'laws and constitution; seven times their wealth, and prosperity, and', 'means of employing our population.  Much has been given to England,', 'and of her much will be required.  And if you could only see the', 'state of mankind over the greatest part of the globe, how infinitely', ""fewer opportunities they have of knowing God's will than you have,"", 'you would feel that to you, poor and struggling as some of you are--', 'to you much has been given, and of you much will be required.', '', 'Now first, what do I mean by Christ being our king?  I daresay there', 'are some among you who are inclined to think that, when we talk of', 'Christ being a king, that the word king means something very', 'different from its common meaning--and, God knows, that that is true', 'enough.  Our blessed Lord took care to make people understand that--', 'how He was not like one of the kings of the nations, how His kingdom', 'was not of this world.  But yet the Bible tells us again and again', 'that all good kings, all real kings, are patterns of Christ; and,', 'therefore, that when we talk of Christ being a king, we mean that He', 'is a king in everything that a king ought to be; that He fulfils', 'perfectly all the duties of a king; that He is the pattern which all', 'kings ought to copy.  Kings have been in all ages too apt to forget', 'that, and, indeed, so have the people too.  We English have forgotten', 'most thoroughly in these days, that Christ is our king, or even a', 'king at all.  We talk of Christ being a ""spiritual"" king, and then we', ""say that that merely means that He is king of Christians' hearts."", 'And when anyone asks what that means, it comes out, that all we mean', 'is, that Christ has a very great influence over the hearts of', 'believing Christians--when He can obtain it; or else that it means', 'that He is king of a very small number of people called the elect,', 'whom He has chosen out, but that He has absolutely nothing to do with', 'the whole rest of the world.  And then, when anyone stands up with', 'the Bible in his hand, and says, in the plain words of Scripture:', '""Christ is not only the king of believers, He is the king of the', 'whole earth; the king of the clouds and the thunder, the king of the', 'land and the cattle, and the trees, and the corn, and to whomsoever', 'He will He giveth them.  Christ is not only the king of believers--He', 'is the king of all--the king of the wicked, of the heathen, of those', 'who do not believe Him, who never heard of Him.  Christ is not only', 'the king of a few individual persons, one here and one there in every', 'parish, but He is the king of every nation.  He is the king of', 'England, by the grace of God, just as much as Queen Victoria is, and', 'ten thousand times more.""  If any man talks in this way, people', 'stare--think him an enthusiast--ask him what new doctrine this is,', 'and call his words unscriptural, just because they come out of', ""Scripture and not out of men's perversions and twistings of"", 'Scripture.  Nevertheless Christ is King; really and truly King of', 'Kings and Lord of Lords; and He will make men know it.  What He was,', 'that He is and ever will be; there is no change in Him; His kingdom', 'is an everlasting kingdom, and His dominion endureth throughout all', 'ages, and woe unto those, small or great, who rebel against Him!', '', 'But what sort of a king is He?  He is a king of law, and order, and', 'justice.  He is not selfish, fanciful, self-willed.  He said himself', ""that He came not to do His own will, but His Father's.  He is a king"", 'of gentleness and meekness too:  but do not mistake that.  There is', 'no weak indulgence in Him.  A man may be very meek, and yet stern', 'enough and strong enough.  Moses was the meekest of men, we read, and', 'yet He made those who rebelled against him feel that he was not to be', 'trifled with.  Korah, Dathan, and Abiram found that to their cost.', 'He would not even spare his own brother Aaron, his own sister Miriam,', 'when they rebelled.  And he was right.  He showed his love by it;', 'indulgence is not love.  It is no sign of meekness, but only of', 'cowardice and carelessness, to be afraid to rebuke sin.  Moses knew', ""that he was doing God's work, that he was appointed to make a great"", 'nation of those slavish besotted Jews, his countrymen; that he was', 'sent by God with boundless blessings to them; and woe to whoever', 'hindered him from that.  Because he loved the Jews, therefore he', 'dared punish those who tempted them to forget the promised land of', ""Canaan, or break God's covenant, in which lay all their hope."", '', 'And such a one is our King, my friends; Jesus Christ the Son ']"

Among the various characteristics of the age in which we live, as', 'compared with other ages of this not yet _very_ experienced world, one', 'of the most notable appears to me to be the just and wholesome contempt', 'in which we hold poverty. I repeat, the _just_ and _wholesome_ contempt;', 'though I see that some of my hearers look surprised at the expression. I', 'assure them, I use it in sincerity; and I should not have ventured to', 'ask you to listen to me this evening, unless I had entertained a', 'profound respect for wealth--true wealth, that is to say; for, of', 'course, we ought to respect neither wealth nor anything else that is', 'false of its kind: and the distinction between real and false wealth is', 'one of the points on which I shall have a few words presently to say to', 'you. But true wealth I hold, as I said, in great honour; and sympathize,', 'for the most part, with that extraordinary feeling of the present age', 'which publicly pays this honour to riches.', '', '', '2. I cannot, however, help noticing how extraordinary it is, and how', 'this epoch of ours differs from all bygone epochs in having no', 'philosophical nor religious worshippers of the ragged godship of', 'poverty. In the classical ages, not only were there people who', 'voluntarily lived in tubs, and who used gravely to maintain the', 'superiority of tub-life to town-life, but the Greeks and Latins seem to', 'have looked on these eccentric, and I do not scruple to say, absurd', 'people, with as much respect as we do upon large capitalists and landed', 'proprietors; so that really, in those days, no one could be described as', 'purse proud, but only as empty-purse proud. And no less distinct than', 'the honour which those curious Greek people pay to their conceited poor,', 'is the disrespectful manner in which they speak of the rich; so that', 'one cannot listen long either to them, or to the Roman writers who', 'imitated them, without finding oneself entangled in all sorts of', 'plausible absurdities; hard upon being convinced of the uselessness of', 'collecting that heavy yellow substance which we call gold, and led', 'generally to doubt all the most established maxims of political economy.', '', '', '3. Nor are matters much better in the Middle Ages. For the Greeks and', 'Romans contented themselves with mocking at rich people, and', 'constructing merry dialogues between Charon and Diogenes or Menippus, in', 'which the ferryman and the cynic rejoiced together as they saw kings and', 'rich men coming down to the shore of Acheron, in lamenting and', 'lamentable crowds, casting their crowns into the dark waters, and', 'searching, sometimes in vain, for the last coin out of all their', 'treasures that could ever be of use to them.', '', '', '4. But these Pagan views of the matter were indulgent, compared with', 'those which were held in the Middle Ages, when wealth seems to have been', 'looked upon by the best men not only as contemptible, but as criminal.', 'The purse round the neck is, then, one of the principal signs of', 'condemnation in the pictured Inferno; and the Spirit of Poverty is', 'reverenced with subjection of heart, and faithfulness of affection, like', 'that of a loyal knight for his lady, or a loyal subject for his queen.', 'And truly, it requires some boldness to quit ourselves of these', 'feelings, and to confess their partiality or their error, which,', 'nevertheless, we are certainly bound to do. For wealth is simply one of', 'the greatest powers which can be entrusted to human hands: a power, not', 'indeed to be envied, because it seldom makes us happy; but still less to', 'be abdicated or despised; while, in these days, and in this country, it', 'has become a power all the more notable, in that the possessions of a', 'rich man are not represented, as they used to be, by wedges of gold or', 'coffers of jewels, but by masses of men variously employed, over whose', 'bodies and minds the wealth, according to its direction, exercises', 'harmful or helpful influence, and becomes, in that alternative, Mammon', 'either of Unrighteousness or of Righteousness.', '', '', '5. Now, it seemed to me that since, in the name you have given to this', 'great gathering of British pictures, you recognize them as', 'Treasures--that is, I suppose, as part and parcel of the real wealth of', 'the country--you might not be uninterested in tracing certain commercial', 'questions connected with this particular form of wealth.

Sun and Shadow', '', '', 'Thirty years ago, Marseilles lay burning in the sun, one day.', '', 'A blazing sun upon a fierce August day was no greater rarity in southern', 'France then, than at any other time, before or since. Everything in', 'Marseilles, and about Marseilles, had stared at the fervid sky, and been', 'stared at in return, until a staring habit had become universal there.', 'Strangers were stared out of countenance by staring white houses,', 'staring white walls, staring white streets, staring tracts of arid road,', 'staring hills from which verdure was burnt away. The only things to be', 'seen not fixedly staring and glaring were the vines drooping under their', 'load of grapes. These did occasionally wink a little, as the hot air', 'barely moved their faint leaves.', '', 'There was no wind to make a ripple on the foul water within the harbour,', 'or on the beautiful sea without. The line of demarcation between the two', 'colours, black and blue, showed the point which the pure sea would not', 'pass; but it lay as quiet as the abominable pool, with which it never', 'mixed. Boats without awnings were too hot to touch; ships blistered at', 'their moorings; the stones of the quays had not cooled, night or', 'day, for months. Hindoos, Russians, Chinese, Spaniards, Portuguese,', 'Englishmen, Frenchmen, Genoese, Neapolitans, Venetians, Greeks, Turks,', 'descendants from all the builders of Babel, come to trade at Marseilles,', 'sought the shade alike--taking refuge in any hiding-place from a sea too', 'intensely blue to be looked at, and a sky of purple, set with one great', 'flaming jewel of fire.', '', 'The universal stare made the eyes ache. Towards the distant line of', 'Italian coast, indeed, it was a little relieved by light clouds of mist,', 'slowly rising from the evaporation of the sea, but it softened nowhere', 'else. Far away the staring roads, deep in dust, stared from the', 'hill-side, stared from the hollow, stared from the interminable', 'plain. Far away the dusty vines overhanging wayside cottages, and the', 'monotonous wayside avenues of parched trees without shade, drooped', 'beneath the stare of earth and sky. So did the horses with drowsy bells,', 'in long files of carts, creeping slowly towards the interior; so did', 'their recumbent drivers, when they were awake, which rarely happened;', 'so did the exhausted labourers in the fields. Everything that lived or', 'grew, was oppressed by the glare; except the lizard, passing swiftly', 'over rough stone walls, and the cicala, chirping his dry hot chirp, like', 'a rattle. The very dust was scorched brown, and something quivered in', 'the atmosphere as if the air itself were panting.', '', 'Blinds, shutters, curtains, awnings, were all closed and drawn to keep', 'out the stare. Grant it but a chink or keyhole, and it shot in like a', 'white-hot arrow. The churches were the freest from it. To come out of', 'the twilight of pillars and arches--dreamily dotted with winking lamps,', 'dreamily peopled with ugly old shadows piously dozing, spitting, and', 'begging--was to plunge into a fiery river, and swim for life to the', 'nearest strip of shade. So, with people lounging and lying wherever', 'shade was, with but little hum of tongues or barking of dogs, with', 'occasional jangling of discordant church bells and rattling of vicious', 'drums, Marseilles, a fact to be strongly smelt and tasted, lay broiling', 'in the sun one day. In Marseilles that day there was a villainous', 'prison. In one of its chambers, so repulsive a place that even the', 'obtrusive stare blinked at it, and left it to such refuse of reflected', 'light as it could find for itself, were two men. Besides the two men,', 'a notched and disfigured bench, immovable from the wall, with a', 'draught-board rudely hacked upon it with a knife, a set of draughts,', 'made of old buttons and soup bones, a set of dominoes, two mats, and two', 'or three wine bottles. That was all the chamber held, exclusive of rats', 'and other unseen vermin, in addition to the seen vermin, the two men.', '', 'It received such light as it got through a grating of iron bars', 'fashioned like a pretty large window, by means of which it could be', 'always inspected from the gloomy staircase on which the grating gave.', 'There was a broad strong ledge of stone to this grating where the bottom', 'of it was let into the masonry, three or four feet above the ground.', 'Upon it, one of the two men lolled, half sitting and half lying, with', 'his knees drawn up, and his feet and shoulders planted against the', 'opposite sides of the aperture. The bars were wide enough apart to', 'admit of his thrusting his arm through to the elbow; and so he held on', 'negligently, for his greater ease.', '', 'A prison taint was on everything there. The imprisoned air, the', 'imprisoned light, the imprisoned damps, the imprisoned men, were all', 'deteriorated by confinement. As the captive men were faded and haggard,', 'so the iron was rusty, the stone was slimy, the wood was rotten, the air', 'was faint, the light was dim. Like a well, like a vault, like a tomb,', 'the prison had no knowledge of the brightness outside, and would have', 'kept its polluted atmosphere intact in one of the spice islands of the', 'Indian ocean.', '', 'The man who lay on the ledge of the grating was even chilled. He jerked', 'his great cloak more heavily upon him by an impatient movement of one', ""shoulder, and growled, 'To the devil with this Brigand of a Sun that"", ""never shines in here!'"", '', 'He was waiting to be fed, looking sideways through the bars that he', 'might see the further down the stairs, with much of the expression of', 'a wild beast in similar expectation. But his eyes, too close together,', 'were not so nobly set in his head as those of the king of beasts']"

The poet"", 'does not wait for the hero or the sage, but, as they act and think', 'primarily, so he writes primarily what will and must be spoken,', 'reckoning the others, though primaries also, yet, in respect to him,', 'secondaries and servants; as sitters or models in the studio of a', 'painter, or as assistants who bring building materials to an architect.', '', 'For poetry was all written before time was, and whenever we are so', 'finely organized that we can penetrate into that region where the air', 'is music, we hear those primal warblings and attempt to write them down,', 'but we lose ever and anon a word or a verse and substitute something of', 'our own, and thus miswrite the poem. The men of more delicate ear write', 'down these cadences more faithfully, and these transcripts, though', 'imperfect, become the songs of the nations. For nature is as truly', 'beautiful as it is good, or as it is reasonable, and must as much appear', 'as it must be done, or be known. Words and deeds are quite indifferent', 'modes of the divine energy. Words are also actions, and actions are a', 'kind of words.', '', 'The sign and credentials of the poet are that he announces that which no', 'man foretold. He is the true and only doctor; he knows and tells; he is', 'the only teller of news, for he was present and privy to the appearance', 'which he describes. He is a beholder of ideas and an utterer of the', 'necessary and causal. For we do not speak now of men of poetical', 'talents, or of industry and skill in metre, but of the true poet. I', 'took part in a conversation the other day concerning a recent writer of', 'lyrics, a man of subtle mind, whose head appeared to be a music-box of', 'delicate tunes and rhythms, and whose skill and command of language, we', 'could not sufficiently praise. But when the question arose whether he', 'was not only a lyrist but a poet, we were obliged to confess that he is', 'plainly a contemporary, not an eternal man. He does not stand out of our', 'low limitations, like a Chimborazo under the line, running up from the', 'torrid Base through all the climates of the globe, with belts of the', 'herbage of every latitude on its high and mottled sides; but this genius', 'is the landscape-garden of a modern house, adorned with fountains and', 'statues, with well-bred men and women standing and sitting in the walks', 'and terraces. We hear, through all the varied music, the ground-tone of', 'conventional life. Our poets are men of talents who sing, and not the', 'children of music. The argument is secondary, the finish of the verses', 'is primary.', '', 'For it is not metres, but a metre-making argument that makes a poem,--a', 'thought so passionate and alive that like the spirit of a plant or an', 'animal it has an architecture of its own, and adorns nature with a new', 'thing. The thought and the form are equal in the order of time, but in', 'the order of genesis the thought is prior to the form. The poet has a', 'new thought; he has a whole new experience to unfold; he will tell us', 'how it was with him, and all men will be the richer in his fortune. For', 'the experience of each new age requires a new confession, and the world', 'seems always waiting for its poet. I remember when I was young how much', 'I was moved one morning by tidings that genius had appeared in a youth', 'who sat near me at table. He had left his work and gone rambling none', 'knew whither, and had written hundreds of lines, but could not tell', 'whether that which was in him was therein told; he could tell nothing', 'but that all was changed,--man, beast, heaven, earth and sea. How gladly', 'we listened! how credulous! Society seemed to be compromised. We sat', 'in the aurora of a sunrise which was to put out all the stars. Boston', 'seemed to be at twice the distance it had the night before, or was much', 'farther than that. Rome,--what was Rome? Plutarch and Shakspeare were', 'in the yellow leaf, and Homer no more should be heard of. It is much to', 'know that poetry has been written this very day, under this very roof,', 'by your side. What! that wonderful spirit has not expired! These stony', 'moments are still sparkling and animated! I had fancied that the oracles', 'were all silent, and nature had spent her fires; and behold! all night,', 'from every pore, these fine auroras have been streaming. Every one has', 'some interest in the advent of the poet, and no one knows how much it', 'may concern him. We know that the secret of the world is profound, but', 'who or what shall be our interpreter, we know not. A mountain ramble,', 'a new style of face, a new person, may put the key into our hands.', 'Of course the value of genius to us is in the veracity of its report.', 'Talent may frolic and juggle; genius realizes and adds. Mankind in good', 'earnest have availed so far in understanding themselves and their work,', 'that the foremost watchman on the peak announces his news. It is the', 'truest word ever spoken, and the phrase will be the fittest, most', 'musical, and the unerring voice of the world for that time.', '', 'All that we call sacred history attests that the birth of a poet is', 'the principal event in chronology. Man, never so often deceived, still', 'watches for the arrival of a brother who can hold him steady to a truth', 'until he has made it his own. With what joy I begin to read a poem which', 'I confide in as an inspiration! And now my chains are to be broken; I', 'shall mount above these clouds and opaque airs in which I live,--opaque,', 'though they seem transparent,--and from the heaven of truth I shall see', 'and comprehend my relations.

Kings have been in all ages too apt to forget', 'that, and, indeed, so have the people too.  We English have forgotten', 'most thoroughly in these days, that Christ is our king, or even a', 'king at all.  We talk of Christ being a ""spiritual"" king, and then we', ""say that that merely means that He is king of Christians' hearts."", 'And when anyone asks what that means, it comes out, that all we mean', 'is, that Christ has a very great influence over the hearts of', 'believing Christians--when He can obtain it; or else that it means', 'that He is king of a very small number of people called the elect,', 'whom He has chosen out, but that He has absolutely nothing to do with', 'the whole rest of the world.  And then, when anyone stands up with', 'the Bible in his hand, and says, in the plain words of Scripture:', '""Christ is not only the king of believers, He is the king of the', 'whole earth; the king of the clouds and the thunder, the king of the', 'land and the cattle, and the trees, and the corn, and to whomsoever', 'He will He giveth them.  Christ is not only the king of believers--He', 'is the king of all--the king of the wicked, of the heathen, of those', 'who do not believe Him, who never heard of Him.  Christ is not only', 'the king of a few individual persons, one here and one there in every', 'parish, but He is the king of every nation.  He is the king of', 'England, by the grace of God, just as much as Queen Victoria is, and', 'ten thousand times more.""  If any man talks in this way, people', 'stare--think him an enthusiast--ask him what new doctrine this is,', 'and call his words unscriptural, just because they come out of', ""Scripture and not out of men's perversions and twistings of"", 'Scripture.  Nevertheless Christ is King; really and truly King of', 'Kings and Lord of Lords; and He will make men know it.  What He was,', 'that He is and ever will be; there is no change in Him; His kingdom', 'is an everlasting kingdom, and His dominion endureth throughout all', 'ages, and woe unto those, small or great, who rebel against Him!', '', 'But what sort of a king is He?  He is a king of law, and order, and', 'justice.  He is not selfish, fanciful, self-willed.  He said himself', ""that He came not to do His own will, but His Father's.  He is a king"", 'of gentleness and meekness too:  but do not mistake that.  There is', 'no weak indulgence in Him.  A man may be very meek, and yet stern', 'enough and strong enough.  Moses was the meekest of men, we read, and', 'yet He made those who rebelled against him feel that he was not to be', 'trifled with.

Bullhampton is seventeen miles from', 'Salisbury, eleven from Marlborough, nine from Westbury, seven from', 'Haylesbury, and five from the nearest railroad station, which is', 'called Bullhampton Road, and lies on the line from Salisbury to', 'Ycovil. It is not quite on Salisbury Plain, but probably was so once,', 'when Salisbury Plain was wider than it is now. Whether it should be', 'called a small town or a large village I cannot say. It has no mayor,', 'and no market, but it has a fair. There rages a feud in Bullhampton', 'touching this want of a market, as there are certain Bullhamptonites', 'who aver that the charter giving all rights of a market to', 'Bullhampton does exist; and that at one period in its history the', 'market existed also,--for a year or two; but the three bakers and', 'two butchers are opposed to change; and the patriots of the place,', 'though they declaim on the matter over their evening pipes and', 'gin-and-water, have not enough of matutinal zeal to carry out their', 'purpose. Bullhampton is situated on a little river, which meanders', 'through the chalky ground, and has a quiet, slow, dreamy prettiness', 'of its own. A mile above the town,--for we will call it a town,--the', 'stream divides itself into many streamlets, and there is a district', 'called the Water Meads, in which bridges are more frequent than', 'trustworthy, in which there are hundreds of little sluice-gates for', 'regulating the irrigation, and a growth of grass which is a source', 'of much anxiety and considerable trouble to the farmers. There is a', 'water-mill here, too, very low, with ever a floury, mealy look, with', 'a pasty look often, as the flour becomes damp with the spray of the', 'water as it is thrown by the mill-wheel. It seems to be a tattered,', 'shattered, ramshackle concern, but it has been in the same family', 'for many years; and as the family has not hitherto been in distress,', 'it may be supposed that the mill still affords a fair means of', ""livelihood.

Bullhampton is very quiet. There is no special trade', 'in the place. Its interests are altogether agricultural. It has', 'no newspaper. Its tendencies are altogether conservative. It is', 'a good deal given to religion; and the Primitive Methodists have', 'a very strong holding there, although in all Wiltshire there is', 'not a clergyman more popular in his own parish than the Rev.

I will assume that it made at least one', 'revolution during the first twenty-four hours.  Early the next', 'morning its position was marked, and it made a second revolution in 9', 'hrs.; during the latter part of this revolution it moved much', 'quicker, and the third circle was performed in the evening in a', 'little over 3 hrs.  As on the succeeding morning I found that the', 'shoot revolved in 2 hrs. 45 m., it must have made during the night', 'four revolutions, each at the average rate of a little over 3 hrs.  I', 'should add that the temperature of the room varied only a little.', 'The shoot had now grown 3.5 inches in length, and carried at its', 'extremity a young internode 1 inch in length, which showed slight', 'changes in its curvature.  The next or ninth revolution was effected', 'in 2 hrs. 30 m.  From this time forward, the revolutions were easily', 'observed.  The thirty-sixth revolution was performed at the usual', 'rate; so was the last or thirty-seventh, but it was not completed;', 'for the internode suddenly became upright, and after moving to the', 'centre, remained motionless.  I tied a weight to its upper end, so as', 'to bow it slightly and thus detect any movement; but there was none.', 'Some time before the last revolution was half performed, the lower', 'part of the internode ceased to move.', '', 'A few more remarks will complete all that need be said about this', 'internode.  It moved during five days; but the more rapid movements,', 'after the performance of the third revolution, lasted during three', 'days and twenty hours.  The regular revolutions, from the ninth to', 'thirty-sixth inclusive, were effected at the average rate of 2 hrs.', '31 m.; but the weather was cold, and this affected the temperature of', 'the room, especially during the night, and consequently retarded the', 'rate of movement a little.  There was only one irregular movement,', 'which consisted in the stem rapidly making, after an unusually slow', 'revolution, only the segment of a circle.  After the seventeenth', 'revolution the internode had grown from 1.75 to 6 inches in length,', 'and carried an internode 1.875 inch long, which was just perceptibly', 'moving; and this carried a very minute ultimate internode.  After the', 'twenty-first revolution, the penultimate internode was 2.5 inches', 'long, and probably revolved in a period of about three hours.  At the', 'twenty-seventh revolution the lower and still moving internode was', '8.375, the penultimate 3.5, and the ultimate 2.5 inches in length;', 'and the inclination of the whole shoot was such, that a circle 19', 'inches in diameter was swept by it.  When the movement ceased, the', 'lower internode was 9 inches, and the penultimate 6 inches in length;', 'so that, from the twenty-seventh to thirty-seventh revolutions', 'inclusive, three internodes were at the same time revolving.', '', 'The lower internode, when it ceased revolving, became upright and', 'rigid; but as the whole shoot was left to grow unsupported, it became', 'after a time bent into a nearly horizontal position, the uppermost', 'and growing internodes still revolving at the extremity, but of', 'course no longer round the old central point of the supporting stick.', 'From the changed position of the centre of gravity of the extremity,', 'as it revolved, a slight and slow swaying movement was given to the', 'long horizontally projecting shoot; and this movement I at first', 'thought was a spontaneous one.  As the shoot grew, it hung down more', 'and more, whilst the growing and revolving extremity turned itself up', 'more and more.', '', 'With the Hop we have seen that three internodes were at the same time', 'revolving; and this was the case with most of the plants observed by', 'me.  With all, if in full health, two internodes revolved; so that by', 'the time the lower one ceased to revolve, the one above was in full', 'action, with a terminal internode just commencing to move.  With Hoya', 'carnosa, on the other hand, a depending shoot, without any developed', 'leaves, 32 inches in length, and consisting of seven internodes (a', 'minute terminal one, an inch in length, being counted), continually,', 'but slowly, swayed from side to side in a semicircular course, with', 'the extreme internodes making complete revolutions.  This swaying', 'movement was certainly due to the movement of the lower internodes,', 'which, however, had not force sufficient to swing the whole shoot', 'round the central supporting stick.  The case of another', 'Asclepiadaceous plant, viz., Ceropegia Gardnerii, is worth briefly', 'giving.  I allowed the top to grow out almost horizontally to the', 'length of 31 inches; this now consisted of three long internodes,', 'terminated by two short ones.  The whole revolved in a course opposed', 'to the sun (the reverse of that of the Hop), at rates between 5 hrs.', '15 m. and 6 hrs. 45 m. for each revolution.  The extreme tip thus', 'made a circle of above 5 feet (or 62 inches) in diameter and 16 feet', 'in circumference, travelling at the rate of 32 or 33 inches per hour.', 'The weather being hot, the plant was allowed to stand on my study-', 'table; and it was an interesting spectacle to watch the long shoot', 'sweeping this grand circle, night and day, in search of some object', 'round which to twine.', '', 'If we take hold of a growing sapling, we can of course bend it to all', 'sides in succession, so as to make the tip describe a circle, like', 'that performed by the summit of a spontaneously revolving plant.  By', 'this movement the sapling is not in the least twisted round its own', 'axis.  I mention this because if a black point be painted on the', 'bark, on the side which is uppermost when the sapling is bent towards', ""the holder's body, as the circle is described, the black point"", 'gradually turns round and sinks to the lower side, and comes up again', 'when the circle is completed; and this gives the false appearance of', 'twisting, which, in the case of spontaneously revolving plants,', 'deceived me for a time.

How were they to be purified? How was the blessed sunshine', 'to be thrown into them?', '', 'But Eustace told me that these myths were the most singular things in', 'the world, and that he was invariably astonished, whenever he began', 'to relate one, by the readiness with which it adapted itself to the', 'childish purity of his auditors. The objectionable characteristics seem', 'to be a parasitical growth, having no essential connection with the', 'original fable. They fall away, and are thought of no more, the instant', 'he puts his imagination in sympathy with the innocent little circle,', 'whose wide-open eyes are fixed so eagerly upon him. Thus the stories', ""(not by any strained effort of the narrator's, but in harmony with their"", 'inherent germ) transform themselves, and re-assume the shapes which they', 'might be supposed to possess in the pure childhood of the world. When', 'the first poet or romancer told these marvellous legends (such is', ""Eustace Bright's opinion), it was still the Golden Age. Evil had never"", 'yet existed; and sorrow, misfortune, crime, were mere shadows which', 'the mind fancifully created for itself, as a shelter against too sunny', 'realities; or, at most, but prophetic dreams to which the dreamer', 'himself did not yield a waking credence. Children are now the only', 'representatives of the men and women of that happy era; and therefore it', 'is that we must raise the intellect and fancy to the level of childhood,', 'in order to re-create the original myths.', '', 'I let the youthful author talk as much and as extravagantly as he', 'pleased, and was glad to see him commencing life with such confidence in', 'himself and his performances. A few years will do all that is necessary', 'towards showing him the truth in both respects. Meanwhile, it is', 'but right to say, he does really appear to have overcome the moral', 'objections against these fables, although at the expense of such', 'liberties with their structure as must be left to plead their own', 'excuse, without any help from me. Indeed, except that there was a', 'necessity for it--and that the inner life of the legends cannot be come', ""at save by making them entirely one's own property--there is no defense"", 'to be made.', '', 'Eustace informed me that he had told his stories to the children in', 'various situations--in the woods, on the shore of the lake, in the', 'dell of Shadow Brook, in the playroom, at Tanglewood fireside, and in a', 'magnificent palace of snow, with ice windows, which he helped his', 'little friends to build. His auditors were even more delighted with', 'the contents of the present volume than with the specimens which have', 'already been given to the world. The classically learned Mr. Pringle,', 'too, had listened to two or three of the tales, and censured them even', 'more bitterly than he did THE THREE GOLDEN APPLES; so that, what with', 'praise, and what with criticism, Eustace Bright thinks that there is', 'good hope of at least as much success with the public as in the case of', 'the ""WonderBook.""', '', 'I made all sorts of inquiries about the children, not doubting that', 'there would be great eagerness to hear of their welfare, among some good', 'little folks who have written to me, to ask for another volume of myths.', 'They are all, I am happy to say (unless we except Clover), in excellent', 'health and spirits. Primrose is now almost a young lady, and, Eustace', 'tells me, is just as saucy as ever. She pretends to consider herself', 'quite beyond the age to be interested by such idle stories as these;', 'but, for all that, whenever a story is to be told, Primrose never', 'fails to be one of the listeners, and to make fun of it when finished.', 'Periwinkle is very much grown, and is expected to shut up her baby house', 'and throw away her doll in a month or two more. Sweet Fern has learned', 'to read and write, and has put on a jacket and pair of pantaloons--all', 'of which improvements I am sorry for. Squash Blossom, Blue Eye,', 'Plantain, and Buttercup have had the scarlet fever, but came easily', 'through it. Huckleberry, Milkweed, and Dandelion were attacked with the', 'whooping cough, but bore it bravely, and kept out of doors whenever the', 'sun shone. Cowslip, during the autumn, had either the measles, or some', 'eruption that looked very much like it, but was hardly sick a day. Poor', 'Clover has been a good deal troubled with her second teeth, which have', 'made her meagre in aspect and rather fractious in temper; nor, even when', 'she smiles, is the matter much mended, since it discloses a gap just', 'within her lips, almost as wide as the barn door. But all this will pass', 'over, and it is predicted that she will turn out a very pretty girl.', '', 'As for Mr. Bright himself, he is now in his senior year at Williams', 'College, and has a prospect of graduating with some degree of honorable', ""distinction at the next Commencement. In his oration for the bachelor's"", 'degree, he gives me to understand, he will treat of the classical myths,', 'viewed in the aspect of baby stories, and has a great mind to discus']"

Bullhampton is seventeen miles from', 'Salisbury, eleven from Marlborough, nine from Westbury, seven from', 'Haylesbury, and five from the nearest railroad station, which is', 'called Bullhampton Road, and lies on the line from Salisbury to', 'Ycovil. It is not quite on Salisbury Plain, but probably was so once,', 'when Salisbury Plain was wider than it is now. Whether it should be', 'called a small town or a large village I cannot say. It has no mayor,', 'and no market, but it has a fair. There rages a feud in Bullhampton', 'touching this want of a market, as there are certain Bullhamptonites', 'who aver that the charter giving all rights of a market to', 'Bullhampton does exist; and that at one period in its history the', 'market existed also,--for a year or two; but the three bakers and', 'two butchers are opposed to change; and the patriots of the place,', 'though they declaim on the matter over their evening pipes and', 'gin-and-water, have not enough of matutinal zeal to carry out their', 'purpose. Bullhampton is situated on a little river, which meanders', 'through the chalky ground, and has a quiet, slow, dreamy prettiness', 'of its own. A mile above the town,--for we will call it a town,--the', 'stream divides itself into many streamlets, and there is a district', 'called the Water Meads, in which bridges are more frequent than', 'trustworthy, in which there are hundreds of little sluice-gates for', 'regulating the irrigation, and a growth of grass which is a source', 'of much anxiety and considerable trouble to the farmers. There is a', 'water-mill here, too, very low, with ever a floury, mealy look, with', 'a pasty look often, as the flour becomes damp with the spray of the', 'water as it is thrown by the mill-wheel. It seems to be a tattered,', 'shattered, ramshackle concern, but it has been in the same family', 'for many years; and as the family has not hitherto been in distress,', 'it may be supposed that the mill still affords a fair means of', ""livelihood. The Brattles,--for Jacob Brattle is the miller's"", 'name,--have ever been known as men who paid their way, and were able', 'to hold up their heads. But nevertheless Jacob Brattle is ever at', 'war with his landlord in regard to repairs wanted for his mill,', 'and Mr. Gilmore, the landlord in question, declares that he wishes', 'that the Avon would some night run so high as to carry off the mill', 'altogether. Bullhampton is very quiet. There is no special trade', 'in the place. Its interests are altogether agricultural. It has', 'no newspaper. Its tendencies are altogether conservative. It is', 'a good deal given to religion; and the Primitive Methodists have', 'a very strong holding there, although in all Wiltshire there is', 'not a clergyman more popular in his own parish than the Rev. Frank', 'Fenwick. He himself, in his inner heart, rather likes his rival,', 'Mr. Puddleham, the dissenting minister; because Mr. Puddleham is an', 'earnest man, who, in spite of the intensity of his ignorance, is', 'efficacious among the poor. But Mr. Fenwick is bound to keep up the', 'fight; and Mr. Puddleham considers it to be his duty to put down Mr.', 'Fenwick and the Church Establishment altogether.', '', 'The men of Bullhampton, and the women also, are aware that the glory', 'has departed from them, in that Bullhampton was once a borough, and', 'returned two members to Parliament.

Again, such cases as the following are well', 'established.  The female of species A, if crossed with the male of', 'species B, is fertile; but, if the female of B is crossed with the male', 'of A, she remains barren.  Facts of this kind destroy the value of the', 'supposed criterion.', '', 'If, weary of the endless difficulties involved in the determination of', 'species, the investigator, contenting himself with the rough practical', 'distinction of separable kinds, endeavours to study them as they occur', 'in nature--to ascertain their relations to the conditions which', 'surround them, their mutual harmonies and discordances of structure,', 'the bond of union of their parts and their past history, he finds', 'himself, according to the received notions, in a mighty maze, and with,', 'at most, the dimmest adumbration of a plan.  If he starts with any one', 'clear conviction, it is that every part of a living creature is', 'cunningly adapted to some special use in its life.  Has not his Paley', 'told him that that seemingly useless organ, the spleen, is beautifully', 'adjusted as so much packing between the other organs?  And yet, at the', 'outset of his studies, he finds that no adaptive reason whatsoever can', 'be given for one-half of the peculiarities of vegetable structure; he', 'also discovers rudimentary teeth, which are never used, in the gums of', 'the young calf and in those of the foetal whale; insects which never', 'bite have rudimental jaws, and others which never fly have rudimental', 'wings; naturally blind creatures have rudimental eyes; and the halt', 'have rudimentary limbs.  So, again, no animal or plant puts on its', 'perfect form at once, but all have to start from the same point,', 'however various the course which each has to pursue.  Not only men and', 'horses, and cats and dogs, lobsters and beetles, periwinkles and', 'mussels, but even the very sponges and animalcules commence their', 'existence under forms which are essentially undistinguishable; and this', 'is true of all the infinite variety of plants.  Nay, more, all living', 'beings march side by side along the high road of development, and', 'separate the later the more like they are; like people leaving church,', 'who all go down the aisle, but having reached the door some turn into', 'the parsonage, others go down the village, and others part only in the', 'next parish.  A man in his development runs for a little while parallel', 'with, though never passing through, the form of the meanest worm, then', 'travels for a space beside the fish, then journeys along with the bird', 'and the reptile for his fellow travellers; and only at last, after a', 'brief companionship with the highest of the four-footed and four-handed', 'world, rises into the dignity of pure manhood.  No competent thinker of', 'the present day dreams of explaining these indubitable facts by the', 'notion of the existence of unknown and undiscoverable adaptations to', 'purpose.  And we would remind those who, ignorant of the facts, must be', 'moved by authority, that no one has asserted the incompetence of the', 'doctrine of final causes, in its application to physiology and anatomy,', 'more strongly than our own eminent anatomist, Professor Owen, who,', 'speaking of such cases, says (\'On the Nature of Limbs\', pp. 39, 40): ""I', 'think it will be obvious that the principle of final adaptations fails', 'to satisfy all the conditions of the problem.""', '', 'But, if the doctrine of final causes will not help us to comprehend the', 'anomalies of living structure, the principle of adaptation must surely', 'lead us to understand why certain living beings are found in certain', 'regions of the world and not in others.  The palm, as we know, will not', 'grow in our climate, nor the oak in Greenland.  The white bear cannot', ""live where the tiger thrives, nor 'vice versa', and the more the"", 'natural habits of animal and vegetable species are examined, the more', 'do they seem, on the whole, limited to particular provinces.  But when', 'we look into the facts established by the study of the geographical', 'distribution of animals and plants it seems utterly hopeless to attempt', 'to understand the strange and apparently capricious relations which', ""they exhibit.  One would be inclined to suppose 'a priori' that every"", 'country must be naturally peopled by those animals that are fittest to', 'live and thrive in it.  And yet how, on this hypothesis, are we to', 'account for the absence of cattle in the Pampas of South America, when', 'those parts of the New World were discovered?  It is not that they were', 'unfit for cattle, for millions of cattle now run wild there; and the', 'like holds good of Australia and New Zealand.  It is a curious', 'circumstance, in fact, that the animals and plants of the Northern', 'Hemisphere are not only as well adapted to live in the Southern', 'Hemisphere as its own autochthones, but are in many cases absolutely', 'better adapted, and so overrun and extirpate the aborigines.  Clearly,', 'therefore, the species which naturally inhabit a country are not', 'necessarily the best adapted to its climate and other conditions.  The', 'inhabitants of islands are often distinct from any other known species', 'of animal or plants (witness our recent examples from the work of Sir', 'Emerson Tennent, on Ceylon), and yet they have almost always a sort of', 'general family resemblance to the animals and plants of the nearest', 'mainland.  On the other hand, there is hardly a species of fish, shell,', 'or crab common to the opposite sides of the narrow isthmus of Panama.', 'Wherever we look, then, living nature offers us riddles of difficult', 'solution, if we suppose that what we see is all that can be known ']"

Sir Thomas Underwood had', 'been Solicitor-General for a few months under a Conservative Prime', 'Minister; and when the Conservative Minister went out of office, Sir', 'Thomas Underwood followed him with no feeling of regret that caused', 'him unhappiness. But when afterwards the same party came back to', 'power, and he, having lost his election at the borough which he had', 'represented, was passed over without a word of sympathy or even of', 'assumed regret from the Minister, then he was wounded.

But all this,--this formation of a Ministry,', 'in which the late Solicitor-General was not invited to take a', 'part,--occurred seven years before the commencement of our story.', '', 'During those years in which our lawyer sat in Parliament as Mr.', 'Underwood,--at which time he was working hard also as a Chancery', 'barrister, and was, perhaps, nearer to his fellow-men than he had', 'ever been before, or was ever destined to be afterwards,--he resided,', 'as regarded himself almost nominally, at a small but pretty villa,', ""which he had taken for his wife's sake at Fulham. It was close upon"", 'the river, and had well-arranged, though not extensive, shrubbery', 'walks, and a little lawn, and a tiny conservatory, and a charming', 'opening down to the Thames.

But if a man lives at the place in which he most often', 'sleeps, Sir Thomas in truth lived at his chambers at Southampton', 'Buildings. When he moved those household gods of his to the villa, it', 'was necessary, because of his duties in Parliament, that he should', 'have some place in town wherein he might lay his head, and therefore,', 'I fear not unwillingly, he took to laying his head very frequently in', 'the little bedroom which was attached to his chambers.', '', 'It is not necessary that we should go back to any feelings which', ""might have operated upon him during his wife's lifetime, or during"", 'the period of his parliamentary career. His wife was now dead, and', 'he no longer held a seat in Parliament. He had, indeed, all but', 'abandoned his practice at the Bar, never putting himself forward for', 'the ordinary business of a Chancery barrister. But, nevertheless,', 'he spent the largest half of his life in his chambers, breakfasting', 'there, reading there, writing there, and sleeping there.

The charm of his face consisted in a pair of very', '     bright black eyes, which were, however, set too near together in', '     his face for the general delight of Christians. He was stout fat', '     all over rather than corpulent and had that look of command in his', '     face which has become common to master-butchers, probably by long', '     intercourse with sheep and oxen.', '', 'The case for Trollope being anti-semitic is harder to support, however,', 'when one considers the behavior of his Jewish characters. Brehgert,', 'whose physical description above is stereotypic, is one of the few', 'characters in _The Way We Live Now_ whose actions are completely', 'honorable. Trollope wrote 16 novels before _Nina Balatka_; only two of', 'those contain Jewish characters. The first, who plays a minor role in', '_Orley Farm_ (1862), is Soloman Aram, an attorney--a Victorian Rumpole', '--known for defending the accused at the Old Bailey. His skill is needed', 'to defend Lady Mason against a charge of perjury, much to the distaste', 'of her Christian advisors. He acts with dignity and shows great', 'consideration for the personal comfort of Lady Mason during her trial.', ""The second Jewish character in Trollope's novels was Mr. Hart, a London"", 'tailor who runs for a seat in Parliament in _Rachel Ray_ (1863). This', 'served no purpose in the plot; the situation probably was included', 'because legislation to allow Jews to serve in Parliament had been', 'passed only five years before, and the issue was still one of public', ""discussion.

A pleasing French writer of fairy tales, Monsieur Pajon,', 'author of the History of Prince Soly, has set a diverting example of', 'the same machinery, where he introduces the presiding Genius of the', 'land of Romance conversing with one of the personages of the tale.', '', 'In this Introductory Epistle, the author communicates, in confidence,', 'to Captain Clutterbuck, his sense that the White Lady had not met the', 'taste of the times, and his reason for withdrawing her from the scene.', 'The author did not deem it equally necessary to be candid respecting', 'another alteration. The Monastery was designed, at first, to have', 'contained some supernatural agency, arising out of the fact, that', ""Melrose had been the place of deposit of the great Robert Bruce's"", 'heart. The writer shrunk, however, from filling up, in this', 'particular, the sketch as it was originally traced; nor did he venture', 'to resume, in continuation, the subject which he had left unattempted', 'in the original work. Thus, the incident of the discovery of the', 'heart, which occupies the greater part of the Introduction to the', 'Monastery, is a mystery unnecessarily introduced, and which remains at', 'last very imperfectly explained. In this particular, I was happy to', 'shroud myself by the example of the author of ""Caleb Williams,"" who', 'never condescends to inform us of the actual contents of that Iron', 'Chest which makes such a figure in his interesting work, and gives the', ""name to Mr. Colman's drama."", '', 'The public had some claim to inquire into this matter, but it seemed', 'indifferent policy in the author to give the explanation. For,', 'whatever praise may be due to the ingenuity which brings to a general', 'combination all the loose threads of a narrative, like the knitter at', 'the finishing of her stocking, I am greatly deceived if in many cases', 'a superior advantage is not attained, by the air of reality which the', 'deficiency of explanation attaches to a work written on a different', 'system. In life itself, many things befall every mortal, of which the', 'individual never knows the real cause or origin; and were we to point', 'out the most marked distinction between a real and a fictitious', 'narrative, we would say, that the former in reference to the remote', 'causes of the events it relates, is obscure, doubtful, and mysterious;', ""whereas, in the latter case, it is a part of the author's duty to"", 'afford satisfactory details upon the causes of the separate events he', 'has recorded, and, in a word, to account for every thing.

Accordingly, Cooper', 'planned a series of stories which Wiley noticed as in press in the', '_Repository_ for May 1822 and which he described as ""_American Tales_,', 'by a Lady, viz. Imagination--Heart--Matter--Manner--Matter and Manner. 2', 'vols. 18 mo. Wiley and Halsted, New York."" A briefer announcement had', 'appeared earlier, in the October 1821 issue of the _Repository_,', 'although _The Spy_, which was certainly in press, was not noticed. In', 'his letter of 7 January 1822 congratulating Cooper on the great success', 'of _The Spy_, Wiley observed: ""You speak of being engaged about \'the', ""Pioneer.'--Have you forgotten 'the American Tales,' which were commenced"", 'by a certain lady a long time ago?""', '', ""What happened, evidently, was that Cooper's interest in _The Spy_ had"", 'revived with such force that he had gone on to complete that book and to', ""begin _The Pioneers_. Wiley's problem was then to persuade his reluctant"", 'author to complete a work in which he had lost interest but which was in', 'press. Wiley was not successful. The three final tales, ""Manner,""', '""Matter,"" and ""Manner and Matter,"" were never written. Eventually the', 'publisher prevailed on Cooper to bring ""Heart,"" the second of the', 'stories, to a hurried conclusion. The author, probably happy to settle', 'the matter, then wrote a coy Preface alluding mysteriously to', '""unforeseen circumstances"" which had prevented the completion of the', 'series, and gave the two stories to Wiley on the condition that their', 'authorship be concealed. Thus _The American Tales_ became _Tales for', 'Fifteen_. A more eloquent criticism by the author could hardly be', 'wished.', '', 'When Cooper permitted ""Imagination"" and ""Heart"" to be reprinted in 1841,', 'he was again conferring a favor on a publisher. Towards the close of', '1840 George Roberts, publisher and proprietor of the _Boston Notion_,', 'subtitled without exaggeration ""The Mammoth Sheet of the World,"" sent', 'Cooper a circular letter in the hand of a clerk to request a short', ""contribution suitable for his new publication, _Roberts' Semi-Monthly"", 'Magazine_. Normally, Cooper refused all such requests: but he was under', 'the erroneous impression that Roberts had forwarded to him some Danish', 'translations of his works which Longfellow had sent to America for him a', 'few years before. Remembering these early stories, he replied to Roberts', 'on 2 January 1841: ""Some fifteen or twenty years since my publisher', 'became embarrassed, and I wrote two short tales to aid him. He printed', 'them, under the title of _Tales for Fifteen_, by Jane Morgan. One of', 'these stories, rather a feeble one I fear, was called Heart--the other', 'Imagination. This tale was written one rainy day, half asleep and half', 'awake, but I retain rather a favorable impression of it. If you can find', 'a copy of the book, you might think Imagination worth reprinting, and I', 'suppose there can _now_ be no objection to it. It would have the', 'freshness of novelty, and would be American enough, Heaven knows. It', 'would fill three or four of your columns.""', '', 'Cooper owned no copy of _Tales for Fifteen_; but the resourceful', 'publisher found a copy in New York, and ""Imagination"" filled almost the', 'whole of the front page (approximately 60 by 34-1/2 inches) of the', '_Boston Notion_ on 30 January 1841. It was reprinted in what was', ""apparently a second edition of _Roberts' Semi-Monthly Magazine_ for 1"", ""and 15 February 1841 and in London in William Hazlitt's _Romanticist and"", ""Novelist's Library_. A subsequent request brought permission for the"", 'reprinting of ""Heart,"" which appeared in the _Boston Notion_ for 13 and', ""20 March 1841 and in _Roberts' Semi-Monthly Magazine_ for 1 and 15 April"", '1841. Roberts expressed his gratitude by defending Cooper in his paper', 'from the charge of aristocratic bias which some New York journalists had', 'brought against _Home As Found_. Doubtless the publisher would have been', 'pleased to find other American writers sufficiently democratic to', 'provide free copy.', '', '_Tales for Fifteen_ owes most of its interest today to its crucial', 'position in the Cooper canon. The literary value of ""Imagination"" and', '""Heart,"" as their author realized, is slight. They were essentially', 'experiments in which he sought to deploy indigenous materials within the', 'conventions of British domestic fiction. ""Imagination,"" with its', 'sprightly observation of American middle-class vulgarities, betrays a', 'satiric awareness that Cooper did later develop; but ""Heart"" is a forced', 'sentimental indulgence of a sort he never permitted by preference in', 'later works, though he sometimes tolerated it as a concession to', 'feminine readers. For Cooper the chief significance of these stories was', 'that they demonstrated forcibly, if demonstration was necessary, that', 'neither the characteristic materials nor the characteristic forms', 'employed by the British women were congenial to his imagination. His', 'failure was altogether fortunate; for had _The American Tales_ been', ""completed and published instead of _The Spy_, Cooper's career and the"", 'course of much of American literature might have been different.', '', 'First editions of _Tales for Fifteen_ are the rarest of all Cooper', '""firsts.""

Let us now', 'endeavour to reduce this notion of a horse that we now have, to', 'some such kind of simple expression as can be at once, and without', 'difficulty, retained in the mind, apart from all minor details. If', 'I make a transverse section, that is, if I were to saw a dead horse', 'across, I should find that, if I left out the details, and supposing I', 'took my section through the anterior region, and through the fore-limbs,', 'I should have here this kind of section of the body (Fig. 1). Here would', 'be the upper part of the animal--that great mass of bones that we spoke', 'of as the spine (a, Fig. 1). Here I should have the alimentary canal', '(b, Fig. 1). Here I should have the heart (c, Fig. 1); and then you see,', 'there would be a kind of double tube, the whole being inclosed within', 'the hide; the spinal marrow would be placed in the upper tube (a, Fig.', '1), and in the lower tube (d d, Fig. 1), there would be the alimentary', 'canal (b), and the heart (c); and here I shall have the legs proceeding', ""from each side. For simplicity's sake, I represent them merely as stumps"", '(e e, Fig. 1). Now that is a horse--as mathematicians would say--reduced', 'to its most simple expression. Carry that in your minds, if you please,', 'as a simplified idea of the structure of the Horse. The considerations', 'which I have now put before you belong to what we technically call the', ""'Anatomy' of the Horse. Now, suppose we go to work upon these several"", 'parts,--flesh and hair, and skin and bone, and lay open these', 'various organs with our scalpels, and examine them by means of our', 'magnifying-glasses, and see what we can make of them. We shall find that', 'the flesh is made up of bundles of strong fibres. The brain and nerves,', 'too, we shall find, are made up of fibres, and these queer-looking', 'things that are called ganglionic corpuscles. If we take a slice of the', 'bone and examine it, we shall find that it is very like this diagram', 'of a section of the bone of an ostrich, though differing, of course,', 'in some details; and if we take any part whatsoever of the tissue, and', 'examine it, we shall find it all has a minute structure, visible only', 'under the microscope. All these parts constitute microscopic anatomy', ""or 'Histology.' These parts are constantly being changed; every part is"", 'constantly growing, decaying, and being replaced during the life of the', 'animal. The tissue is constantly replaced by new material; and if you go', 'back to the young state of the tissue in the case of muscle, or in the', 'case of skin, or any of the organs I have mentioned, you will find that', 'they all come under the same condition. Every one of these microscopic', 'filaments and fibres (I now speak merely of the general character of the', 'whole process)--every one of these parts--could be traced down to', 'some modification of a tissue which can be readily divided into little', 'particles of fleshy matter, of that substance which is composed of the', 'chemical elements, carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen, having such', 'a shape as ']"

0,2003,Kite Runner,4,"That same night, I wrote my first short story. It took me thirty minutes. It was a dark little tale about a man who found a magic cup and learned that if he wept into the cup, his tears turned into pearls. But even though he had always been poor, he was a happy man and rarely shed a tear. So he found ways to make himself sad so that his tears could make him rich. As the pearls piled up, so did his greed grow. The story ended with the man sitting on a mountain of pearls, knife in hand, weeping helplessly into the cup with his beloved wife's slain body in his arms"
1,2001,Life of pi,4,"I know a woman here in Toronto who is very dear to my heart. She was my foster mother. I call her Auntieji and she likes that. She is Quebecoise. Though she has lived in Toronto for over thirty years, her French-speaking mind still slips on occasion on the understanding of English sounds. And so, when she first heard of Hare Krishnas, she didn't hear right. She heard ""Hairless Christians"", and that is what they were to her for many years. When I corrected her, I told her that in fact she was not so wrong; that Hindus, in their capacity for love, are indeed hairless Christians, just as Muslims, in the way they see God in everything, are bearded Hindus, and Christians, in their devotion to God, are hat-wearing Muslims."
2,2003,The da vinci code,4,"Sophie stopped the taxi at an imposing gate that blocked the bank’s driveway—a cement-lined ramp that descended beneath the building. A video camera overhead was aimed directly at them, and Langdon had the feeling that this camera, unlike those at the Louvre, was authentic. Sophie rolled down the window and surveyed the electronic podium on the driver’s side. An LCD screen provided directions in seven languages. Topping the list was English."
3,2003,The curious incident of the dog in the night,4,"A lie is when you say something happened which didn't happen. But there is only ever one thing which happened at a particular time and a particular place. And there are an infinite number of things which didn't happen at that time and that place. And if I think about something which didn't happen I start thinking about all the other things which didn't happen.
For example, this morning for breakfast I had Ready Brek and some hot raspberry milkshake. But if I say that I actually had Shreddies and a mug of tea I start thinking about Coco-Pops and lemonade and Porridge and Dr Pepper and how I wasn't eating my breakfast in Egypt and there wasn't a rhinoceros in the room and Father wasn't wearing a diving suit and so on and even writing this makes me feel shaky and scared, like I do when I'm standing on the top of a very tall building and there are thousands of houses and cars and people below me and my head is so full of all these things that I'm afraid that I'm going to forget to stand up straight and hang onto the rail and I'm going to fall over and be killed."
4,2005,Twilight,4,"I didn't see him leap me - it was much too fast. I only found myself suddenly airborne, and then we crashed onto the sofa, knocking it into the wall. All the while, his arms formed an iron cage of protection around me - I was barely jostled. But I still was gasping as I tried to right myself. He wasn't having that. He curled me into a ball against his chest, holding me more securely than iron chains. I glared at him in alarm, but he seemed well in control, his jaw relaxed as he grinned, his eyes bright only with humor."
5,2001,Atonement,4,"Now and then, an inch below the water's surface, the muscles of his stomach tightened involuntarily as he recalled another detail. A drop of water on her upper arm. Wet. An embroidered flower, a simple daisy, sewn between the cups of her bra. Her breasts wide apart and small. On her back, a mole half covered by a strap. When she climbed out of the pond a glimpse of the triangular darkness her knickers were supposed to conceal. Wet. He saw it, he made himself see it again. The way her pelvic bones stretched the material clear of the skin, the deep curve of her waist, her startling whiteness. When she reached for her skirt, a carelessly raised foot revealed a patch of soil on each pad of her sweetly diminished toes. Another mole the size of a farthing on her thigh and something purplish on her calf--a strawberry mark, a scar. Not blemishes. Adornments."
6,2005,never let me go,4,"That was the only time, as I stood there, looking at that strange rubbish, feeling the wind coming across those empty fields, that I started to imagine just a little fantasy thing, because this was Norfolk after all, and it was only a couple of weeks since I’d lost him. I was thinking about the rubbish, the flapping plastic in the branches, the shore-line of odd stuff caught along the fencing, and I half-closed my eyes and imagined this was the spot where everything I'd ever lost since my childhood had washed up, and I was now standing here in front of it, and if I waited long enough, a tiny figure would appear on the horizon across the field, and gradually get larger until I'd see it was Tommy, and he'd wave, maybe even call. The fantasy never got beyond that --I didn't let it-- and though the tears rolled down my face, I wasn't sobbing or out of control. I just waited a bit, then turned back to the car, to drive off to wherever it was I was supposed to be."
7,2002,middlesex,4,"Emotions, in my experience, aren't covered by single words. I don't believe in ""sadness,"" ""joy,"" or ""regret."" Maybe the best proof that the language is patriarchal is that it oversimplifies feeling. I'd like to have at my disposal complicated hybrid emotions, Germanic train-car constructions like, say, ""the happiness that attends disaster."" Or: ""the disappointment of sleeping with one's fantasy."" I'd like to show how ""intimations of mortality brought on by aging family members"" connects with ""the hatred of mirrors that begins in middle age."" I'd like to have a word for ""the sadness inspired by failing restaurants"" as well as for ""the excitement of getting a room with a minibar."" I've never had the right words to describe my life, and now that I've entered my story, I need them more than ever."

9,1999,the white teeth ,4,"It's a funny thing about the modern world. You hear girls in the toilets of clubs saying, ""Yeah, he fucked off and left me. He didn't love me. He just couldn't deal with love. He was too fucked up to know how to love me."" Now, how did that happen? What was it about this unlovable century that convinced us we were, despite everything, eminently lovable as a people, as a species? What made us think that anyone who fails to love us is damaged, lacking, malfunctioning in some way? And particularly if they replace us with a god, or a weeping madonna, or the face of Christ in a ciabatta roll---then we call them crazy. Deluded. Regressive. We are so convinced of the goodness of ourselves, and the goodness of our love, we cannot bear to believe that there might be something more worthy of love than us, more worthy of worship. Greeting cards routinely tell us everybody deserves love. No. Everybody deserves clean water. Not everybody deserves love all the time."
10,2000,the amber spyglass,4,"I will love you forever; whatever happens. Till I die and after I die, and when I find my way out of the land of the dead, I’ll drift about forever, all my atoms, till I find you again… I’ll be looking for you, every moment, every single moment. And when we do find each other again, we’ll cling together so tight that nothing and no one’ll ever tear us apart. Every atom of me and every atom of you… We’ll live in birds and flowers and dragonflies and pine trees and in clouds and in those little specks of light you see floating in sunbeams… And when they use our atoms to make new lives, they won’t just be able to take one, they’ll have to take two, one of you and one of me, we’ll be joined so tight…"
11,2003,a sorty history,4,"Thanks to ten minutes or so of balmy weather, by 10:24 the Earth is covered in the great carboniferous forests whose residues give us all our coal, and the first winged insects are evident. Dinosaurs plod onto the scene just before 11 P.M. and hold sway for about three-quarters of an hour. At twenty-one minutes to midnight they vanish and the age of mammals begins. Humans emerge one minute and seventeen seconds before midnight. The whole of our recorded history, on this scale, would be no more than a few seconds, a single human lifetime barely an instant. Throughout this greatly speeded-up day continents slide about and bang together at a clip that seems positively reckless. Mountains rise and melt away, ocean basins come and go, ice sheets advance and withdraw. And throughout the whole, about three times every minute, somewhere on the planet there is a flash-bulb pop of light marking the impact of a Manson-sized meteor or one even larger. It's a wonder that anything at all can survive in such a pummeled and unsettled environment. In fact, not many things do for long"
12,2008,the white tiger,4,"Me, and thousands of others in this country like me, are half-baked, because we were never allowed to complete our schooling. Open our skulls, look in with a penlight, and you'll find an odd museum of ideas: sentences of history or mathematics remembered from school textbooks (no boy remembers his schooling like the one who was taken out of school, let me assure you), sentences about politics read in a newspaper while waiting for someone to come to an office, triangles and pyramids seen on the torn pages of the old geometry textbooks which every tea shop in this country uses to wrap its snacks in, bits of All India Radio news bulletins, things that drop into your mind, like lizards from the ceiling, in the half hour before falling asleep--all these ideas, half formed and half digested and half correct, mix up with other half-cooked ideas in your head, and I guess these half-formed ideas bugger one another, and make more half-formed ideas, and this is what you act on and live with."
13,2004,cloud atlas,4,"Belief, like fear or love, is a force to be understood as we understand the theory of relativity and principals of uncertainty. Phenomena that determine the course of our lives. Yesterday, my life was headed in one direction. Today, it is headed in another. Yesterday, I believe I would never have done what I did today. These forces that often remake time and space, that can shape and alter who we imagine ourselves to be, begin long before we are born and continue after we perish. Our lives and our choices, like quantum trajectories, are understood moment to moment. That each point of intersection, each encounter, suggest a new potential direction. Proposition, I have fallen in love with Luisa Rey. Is this possible? I just met her and yet, I feel like something important has happened to me."
14,2006,the god delision,4,"Let us remind ourselves of the terminology. A theist believes in a supernatural intelligence who, in addition to his main work of creating the universe in the first place, is still around to oversee and influence the subsequent fate of his initial creation. In many theistic belief systems, the deity is intimately involved in human affairs. He answers prayers; forgives or punishes sins; intervenes in the world by performing miracles; frets about good and bad deeds, and knows when we do them (or even think about doing them). A deist, too, believes in a supernatural intelligence, but one whose activities were confined to setting up the laws that govern the universe in the first place. The deist God never intervenes thereafter, and certainly has no specific interest in human affairs. Pantheists don't believe in a supernatural God at all, but use the word God as a non-supernatural synonym for Nature, or for the Universe, or for the lawfulness that governs its workings. Deists differ from theists in that their God does not answer prayers, is not interested in sins or confessions, does not read our thoughts and does not intervene with capricious miracles. Deists differ from pantheists in that the deist God is some kind of cosmic intelligence, rather than the pantheist's metaphoric or poetic synonym for the laws of the universe. Pantheism is sexed-up atheism. Deism is watered-down theism."
15,1993,the giver,4,"Lily appeared, wearing her nightclothes, in the doorway. She gave an impatient sigh. 'This is certainly a very LONG private conversation,' she said. 'And there are certain people waiting for their comfort object.' Lily,' her mother said fondly, 'you're very close to being an Eight, and when you're an Eight, your comfort object will be taken away. It will be recycled to the younger children. You should be starting to go off to sleep without it.' But her father had already gone to the shelf and taken down the stuffed elephant which was kept there. Many of the comfort objects, like Lily's, were soft, stuffed, imaginary creatures. Jonas's had been called a bear. Here you are, Lily-billy,' he said. 'I'll come help you remove your hair ribbons."
16,1997,memoirsa of a geisha,4,"To the eyes of the American soldiers who drove past, I looked no different from the women around me; and as I thought of it, who could say I was any different? If you no longer have leaves, or bark, or roots, can you go on calling yourself a tree? ""I am a peasant,"" I said to myself, ""and not a geisha at all any longer."" It was a frightening feeling to look at my hands and see their roughness. To draw my mind away from my fears, I turned my attention again to the truckloads of soldiers driving past. Weren't these the very American soldiers we'd been taught to hate, who had bombed our cities with such horrifying weapons? Now they rode through our neighborhood, throwing pieces of candy to the children."
17,1995,the golden compass,4,"You are so young, Lyra, too young to understand this, but I shall tell you anyway and you'll understand it later: men pass in front of our eyes like butterflies, creatures of a brief season. We love them; they are brave, proud, beautiful, clever; and they die almost at once. They die so soon that our hearts are continually racked with pain. We bear their children, who are witches if they are female, human if not; and then in the blink of an eye they are gone, felled, slain, lost. Our sons, too. When a little boy is growing, he thinks he is immortal. His mother knows he isn't. Each time becomes more painful, until finally your heart is broken. Perhaps that is when Yambe-Akka comes for you. She is older than the tundra. Perhaps, for her, witches' lives are as brief as men's are to us."
18,1998,the poison wood bible,4,"But his kind will always lose in the end. I know this, and now I know why. Whether it's wife or nation they occupy, their mistake is the same: they stand still, and their stake moves underneath them.... Chains rattle, rivers roll, animals startle and bolt, forests inspire and expand, babies stretch open-mouthed from the womb, new seedlings arch their necks and creep forward into the light. Even a language won't stand still. A territory is only possessed for a moment in time. They stake everything on that moment, posing for photographs while planting the flag, casting themselves in bronze.... Even before the flagpole begins to peel and splinter, the ground underneath arches and slides forward into its own new destiny. It may bear the marks of boots on its back, but those marks become the possessions of the land."
19,1999,the perks of being a wallflower,4,"It's much easier to not know things sometimes. Things change and friends leave. And life doesn't stop for anybody. I wanted to laugh. Or maybe get mad. Or maybe shrug at how strange everybody was, especially me. I think the idea is that every person has to live for his or her own life and than make the choice to share it with other people. You can't just sit their and put everybody's lives ahead of yours and think that counts as love. You just can't. You have to do things. I'm going to do what I want to do. I'm going to be who I really am. And I'm going to figure out what that is. And we could all sit around and wonder and feel bad about each other and blame a lot of people for what they did or didn't do or what they didn't know. I don't know. I guess there could always be someone to blame. It's just different. Maybe it's good to put things in perspective, but sometimes, I think that the only perspective is to really be there. Because it's okay to feel things. I was really there. And that was enough to make me feel infinite. I feel infinite."
20,1998,holes,4,"He brought his tray to the table. Behind him, a boy from one of the other tents said, “Hey, what happened to your face?” There was a crash. Stanley turned to see Mr. Sir holding the boy’s head against the oatmeal pot. “Is something wrong with my face?” The boy tried to speak but couldn’t. Mr. Sir had him by the throat. “Does anyone see anything wrong with my face?” asked Mr. Sir, as he continued to choke the boy. Nobody said anything. Mr. Sir let the boy go. His head banged against the table as he fell to the ground. Mr. Sir stood over him and asked, “How does my face look to you now?” A gurgling sound came out of the boy’s mouth, then he managed to gasp the word, “Fine.” “I’m kind of handsome, don’t you think?” “Yes, Mr. Sir.” Out"
21,1996,angelas ashes,4,"Anytime Jesus got hungry all He had to do was go up the road to a fig tree or an orange tree and have His fill. If He wanted a pint He could wave His hand over a big glass and there was the pint. Or He could visit Mary Magdalene and her sister, Martha, and they'd give Him His dinner no questions asked and He'd get his feet washed and dried with Mary Magdalene's hair while Martha washed the dishes, which I don't think is fair. Why should she have to wash the dishes while her sister sits out there chatting away with Our Lord? It's a good thing Jesus decided to be born Jewish in that warm place because if he was born in Limerick he'd catch the consumption and be dead in a month and there wouldn't be any Catholic Church and there wouldn't be any Communion or Confirmation and we wouldn't have to learn the catechism and write compositions about Him."
22,1996,fight club,4,"You have a class of young strong men and women, and they want to give their lives to something. Advertising has these people chasing cars and clothes they don't need. Generations have been working in jobs they hate, just so they can buy what they don't really need. We don't have a great war in our generation, or a great depression, but we do, we have a great war of the spirit. We have a great revolution against the culture. The great depression is our lives. We have a spiritual depression"
23,1999,girl with a pearl earring,4,"I had not yet been down to the cellar where I was to sleep. I took a candle with me but was too tired to look around beyond finding a bed, pillow and blanket. Leaving the trap door of the cellar open so that cool, fresh air could reach me, I took off my shoes, cap, apron and dress, prayed briefly, and lay down. I was about to blow out the candle when I noticed the painting hanging at the foot of my bed. I sat up, wide awake now. It was another picture of Christ on the Cross, smaller than the one upstairs but even more disturbing. Christ had thrown his head back in pain, and Mary Magdalene’s eyes were rolling. I Iay back gingerly, unable to take my eyes off it. I could not imagine sleeping in the room with the painting. I wanted to take it down but did not dare. Finally I blew out the candle—I could not afford to waste candles on my first day in the new house. I lay back again, my eyes fixed to the place where I knew the painting hung. I slept badly that night, tired as I was. I woke often and looked for the painting. Though I could see nothing on the wall, every detail was fixed in my mind. Finally, when it was beginning to grow light, the painting appeared again and I was sure the Virgin Mary was looking down at me."
24,1996,bridget jones diary,4,"Being a woman is worse than being a farmer there is so much harvesting and crop spraying to be done: legs to be waxed, underarms shaved, eyebrows plucked, feet pumiced, skin exfoliated and moisturised, spots cleansed, roots dyed, eyelashes tinted, nails filed, cellulite massaged, stomach muscles exercised. The whole performance is so highly tuned you only need to neglect it for a few days for the whole thing to go to seed. Sometimes I wonder what I would be like if left to revert to nature — with a full beard and handlebar moustache on each shin Dennis Healey eyebrows face a graveyard of dead skin cells spots erupting long curly fingernails like Struwelpeter blind as bat and stupid runt of species as no contact lenses flabby body flobbering around.

25,1992,the secret history,4,"ery Greek idea, and a very profound one. Beauty is terror. Whatever we call beautiful, we quiver before it. And what could be more terrifying and beautiful, to souls like the Greeks or our own, than to lose control completely? To throw off the chains of being for an instant, to shatter the accident of our mortal selves? Euripides speaks of the Maenads: head thrown I back, throat to the stars, ""more like deer than human being."" To be absolutely free! One is quite capable, of course, of working out these destructive passions in more vulgar and less efficient ways. But how glorious to release them in a single burst! To sing, to scream, to dance barefoot in the woods in the dead of night, with no more awareness of mortality than an animal! These are powerful mysteries. The bellowing of bulls. Springs of honey bubbling from the ground. If we are strong enough in our souls we can rip away the veil and look that naked, terrible beauty right in the face; let God consume us, devour us, unstring our bones. Then spit us out reborn"
26,1990,jurassic park,4,"But now science is the belief system that is hundreds of years old. And, like the medieval system before it, science is starting not to fit the world any more. Science has attained so much power that its practical limits begin to be apparent. Largely through science, billions of us live in one small world, densely packed and intercommunicating. But science cannot help us decide what to do with that world, or how to live. Science can make a nuclear reactor, but it cannot tell us not to build it. Science can make pesticide, but cannot tell us not to use it. And our world starts to seem polluted in fundamental ways---air, and water, and land---because of ungovernable science"

You’ll have no wife, nor will you ever hold a child of your own blood in your arms. Robb will rule, you will serve. Men will call you a crow. Him they’ll call `Your Grace’. Singers will praise every little thing he does, while your greatest deeds all go unsung. Tell me that none of this troubles you, Jon… and I’ll name you a liar, and know I have the truth of it"

Because he rather liked people. It was major failing in a demon. Oh, he did his best to make their short lives miserable, because that was his job, but nothing he could think up was half as bad as the stuff they thought up themselves. They seemed to have a talent for it. It was built into the design, somehow. They were born into a world that was against them in a thousand little ways, and then devoted most of their energies to making it worse. Over the years Crowley had found it increasingly difficult to find anything demonic to do which showed up against the natural background of generalized nastiness. There had been times, over the past millennium, when he’d felt like sending a message back Below saying, Look we may as well give up right now, we might as well shut down Dis and Pandemonium and everywhere and move up here, there’s nothing we can do to them that they don’t do to themselves and they do things we’ve never even thought of, often involving electrodes.

To children, the world and everything in it is new, something that gives rise to astonishment. It is not like that for adults. Most adults accept the world as a matter of course. This is precisely where philosophers are a notable exception. A philosopher never gets quite used to the world. To him or her, the world continues to seem a bit unreasonable - bewildering, even enigmatic. Philosophers and small children thus have an important faculty in common. The only thing we require to be good philosophers is the faculty of won"

31,1985,the hand maids tale,4,"Falling in love, we said; I fell for him. We were falling women. We believed in it, this downward motion: so lovely, like flying, and yet at the same time so dire, so extreme, so unlikely. God is love, they once said, but we reversed that, and love, like heaven, was always just around the corner. The more difficult it was to love the particular man beside us, the more we believed in Love, abstract and total. We were waiting, always, for the incarnation. That word, made flesh. And sometimes it happened, for a time. That kind of love comes and goes and is hard to remember afterwards, like pain. You would look at the man one day and you would think, I loved you, and the tense would be past, and you would be filled with a sense of wonder, because it was such an amazing and precarious and dumb thing to have done; and you would know too why your friends had been evasive about it, at the time"
32,1983,pet semeatary,4,"t's probably wrong to believe there can be any limit to the horror which the human mind can experience. On the contrary, it seems that some exponential effect begins to obtain as deeper and deeper darkness falls-as little as one may like to admit it, human experience tends, in a good many ways, to support the idea that when the nightmare grows black enough, horror spawns horror, one coincidental evil begets other, often more deliberate evils, until finally blackness seems to cover everything. And the most terrifying question of all may be just how much horror the human mind can stand and still maintain a wakeful, staring, unrelenting sanity. That such events have their own Rube Goldberg absurdity goes almost without saying. At some point, it all starts to become rather funny. That may be the point at which sanity begins either to save itself or to buckle and break down; that point at which one's sense of humor begins to reassert its"

The Antichrist can be born from piety itself, from excessive love of God or of the truth, as the heretic is born from the saint and the possessed from the seer. Fear prophets, Adso, and those prepared to die for the truth, for as a rule they make many others die with them, often before them, at times instead of them. Jorge did a diabolical thing because he loved his truth so lewdly that he dared anything in order to destroy falsehood"
34,1981,midnights children,4,"One Kashmiri morning in the early spring of 1915, my grandfather Aadam Aziz hit his nose against a frost-hardened tussock of earth while attempting to pray. Three drops of blood plopped out of his left nostril, hardened instantly in the brittle air and lay before his eyes on the prayer-mat, transformed into rubies. Lurching back until he knelt with his head once more upright, he found that the tears which had sprung to his eyes had solidified, too; and at that moment, as he brushed diamonds contemptuously from his lashes, he resolved never again to kiss earth for any god or man. This decision, however, made a hole in him, a vacancy in a vital inner chamber, leaving him vulnerable to women and history. Unaware of this at first, despite his recently completed medical training, he stood up, rolled the prayer-mat into a thick cheroot, and holding it under his right arm surveyed the valley through clear, diamond-free eyes"

Touch others with them, pat them together, stroke them on your face 'cause they don't love that either. You got to love it, you! And no, they ain't in love with your mouth. Yonder, out there, they will see it broken and break it again. What you say out of it they will not heed. What you scream from it they do not hear. What you put into it to nourish your body they will snatch away and give you leavins instead. No, they don't love your mouth. You got to love it. This is flesh I'm talking about here. Flesh that needs to be loved. Feet that need to rest and to dance; backs that need support; shoulders that need arms, strong arms I'm telling you.

So love your neck; put a hand on it, grace it, stroke it and hold it up. and all your inside parts that they'd just as soon slop for hogs, you got to love them.

I know this, because I was raised the Chinese way: I was taught to desire nothing, to swallow other people's misery, to eat my own bitterness. and even though I taught my daughter the opposite, she still came out the same way! Maybe it is because she was born to me and she was born a girl. And I was born to my mother and I was born a girl. All of us are like stairs, one step after another, going up and down, but all going the same way. I know how it is to be quiet, to listen and watch, as if your life were a dream.

She dropped the tasting spoon and tried to run despite the invincible weight of her age, screaming like a madwoman without knowing yet what had happened under the mango leaves, and her heart jumped inside her ribs when she saw her man lying on his back in the mud, dead to this life but still resisting death's final blow for one last minute so that she would have time to come to him. He recognized her despite the uproar, through his tears of unrepeatable sorrow at dying without her, and he looked for her for the last and final time with eyes more luminous, more grief-stricken, more grateful that she had ever seen them in the half century of a shared life, and he managed to say to her with his last breath:"

Perhaps even something deeper like the need to survive. Murray says we are fragile creatures surrounded by a world of hostile facts. Facts threaten our happiness and security. The deeper we delve into things, the looser our structure may seem to become. The family process works towards sealing off the world. Small errors grow heads, fictions proliferate. I tell Murray that ignorance and confusion can’t possibly be the driving forces behind family solidarity. What an idea, what a subversion. He asks me why the strongest family units exist in the least developed societies. Not to know is a weapon of survival, he says. Magic and superstition become entrenched as the powerful orthodoxy of the clan. The family is strongest where objective reality is most likely to be misinterpreted. What a heartless theory, I say. But Murray insists it’s true"

One day early that June she shuffled out to the mailbox at the end of the driveway, leaning heavily on her Boston Post cane (which would go to Vin Marchant when the loudmouthed old bitch popped off, George Meara thought, and good riddance to you, Evvie) and smoking a Herbert Tareyton. She bellowed a greeting at Meara--her deafness had apparently convinced her that everyone else in the world had gone deaf in sympathy--and then shouted that they were going to have the hottest summer in thirty years.

One could presumably drive oneself to distraction in this way. In any case, while it is all very well to talk of 'turning points', one can surely only recognize such moments in retrospect. Naturally, when one looks back to such instances today, they may indeed take the appearance of being crucial, precious moments in one's life; but of course, at the time, this was not the impression one had. Rather, it was as though one had available a never-ending number of days, months, years in which to sort out the vagaries of one's relationship with Miss Kenton; an infinite number of further opportunities in which to remedy the effect of this or that misunderstanding. There was surely nothing to indicate at the time that such evidently small incidents would render whole dreams forever irredeemable"

She was not quite tall enough to reach things around in the kitchen, but she kept a small box in the outhouse which she brought in and stood on in order to get whatever she wanted. Mostly it was hot chocolate she made, warming the milk in a saucepan on the stove before mixing it. Occasionally she made Bovril or Ovaltine. It was pleasant to take a hot drink up to her room and have it beside her as she sat in her silent room reading in the empty house in the afternoons. The books transported her into new worlds and introduced her to amazing people who lived exciting lives. She went to Africa with Ernest Hemingway and to India with Rudyard Kipling.

For now that they could not be together, they must be infinitely apart, and what had been sure and unshakable was now fragile and insubstantial; from the moment we are not together, Alai is a stranger, for he has a life now that will be no part of mine, and that means that when I see him we will not know each other"

It was that deep worry that lives in the base of the skull of every resident of Park Avenue south of Ninety-sixth Street—a black youth, tall, rangy, wearing white sneakers. Now he was forty feet away, thirty-five. Sherman stared at him. Well, let him come! I’m not budging! It’s my territory! I’m not giving way for any street punks! The black youth suddenly made a ninety-degree turn and cut straight across the street to the sidewalk on the other side. The feeble yellow of a sodium-vapor streetlight reflected for an instant on his face as he checked Sherman out. He had crossed over! What a stroke of luck! Not once did it dawn on Sherman McCoy that what the boy had seen was a thirty-eight-year-old white man, soaking wet, dressed in some sort of military-looking raincoat full of straps and buckles, holding a violently lurching animal in his arms, staring, bug-eyed, and talking to himsel"

Respected, charming, hasn't produced a piece of work in ten years. He has a system, which he explained to me. First, he submits an outline for a biography to the Academy to be absolutely sure his approach is consistent with Party policy. A crucial first step, as you'll see later. Now, the person he studies is always an important figure - that is, someone from Moscow - hence Tomashevski must do his Russian research close to home for two years. But this historical character also traveled, yes, lived for some years in Paris or London; hence Tomashevski must do the same, apply for and receive permission for foreign residence. Four years have passed. The Academy and the Party are rubbing their hands in anticipation of this seminal study of the important figure by the eminent Tomashevski. And now Tomashevski must retire to the solitude of a dacha outside Moscow to tend his garden and creatively brood over his cartons of research. Two more years pass in seminal thought. And just as Tomashevski is about to commit himself to paper, he checks with the Academy again only to learn that Party policy has totally about-faced; his hero is a traitor, and with regrets all around, Tomashevski must sacrifice his years of labor for the greater good. Naturally, they are only too happy to urge Tomashevski to start a new pro"

On the other hand, the people whose business it is to ask why, the philosophers, have not been able to keep up with the advance of scientific theories. In the eighteenth century, philosophers considered the whole of human knowledge, including science, to be their field and discussed questions such as: Did the universe have a beginning? However, in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, science became too technical and mathematical for the philosophers, or anyone else except a few specialists. Philosophers reduced the scope of their inquiries so much that Wittgenstein, the most famous philosopher of this century, said, 'The sole remaining task for philosophy is the analysis of language.'

He escaped from bank vaults, nailed-up barrels, sewn mailbags; he escaped from a zinc-lined Knabe piano case, a giant football, a galvanized iron boiler, a rolltop desk, a sausage skin. His escapes were mystifying because he never damaged or appeared to unlock what he escaped from. The screen was pulled away and there he stood disheveled but triumphant beside the inviolate container that was supposed to have contained him. He waved to the crowd. He escaped from a sealed milk can filled with water. He escaped from a Siberian exile van. From a Chinese torture crucifix. From a Hamburg penitentiary. From an English prison ship. From a Boston jail. He was chained to automobile tires, water wheels, cannon, and he escaped. He dove manacled from a bridge into the Mississippi, the Seine, the Mersey, and came up waving.

Taking and not giving back, demanding that ""productivity"" and ""earnings"" keep on increasing with time, the System removing from the rest of the World these vast quantities of energy to keep its own tiny desperate fraction showing a profit: and not only most of humanity—most of the World, animal, vegetable, and mineral, is laid waste in the process. The System may or may not understand that it's only buying time. And that time is an artificial resource to begin with, of no value to anyone or anything but the System, which must sooner or later crash to its death, when its addiction to energy has become more than the rest of the World can supply, dragging with it innocent souls all along the chain of life.

Because that was the way authors customarily treated bit-part players in their made-up tales. And so on.Once I understood what was making America such a dangerous, unhappy nation of people who had nothing to do with real life, I resolved to shun storytelling. I would write about life.

Each hour, as it comes, is but a testimony how fleeting, yet how secure, how certain, is the great whole. It is like an image on the waters, which is ever the same, though the waters ever flow. The sun sinks to rise again; the day is swallowed up in the gloom of night, to be born out of it, as fresh as if it had never been quenched. Spring passes into summer, and through summer and autumn into winter, only the more surely, by its own ultimate return, to triumph over that grave towards which it resolutely hastened from its first hour. We mourn the blossoms of May because they are to wither; but we know that May is one day to have its revenge upon November, by the revolution of that solemn circle which never stops—which teaches us in our height of hope, ever to be sober, and in our depth of desolation, never to desp"

It don’t care. It don’t hate you and me, but it don’t love us, either. Terrible things happen in the world, and they’re things no one can explain. Good people die in bad, painful ways and leave the folks that love them all alone. Sometimes it seems like it’s only the bad people who stay healthy and prosper. The world don’t love you, but your momma does and so do I. You’re a good boy. You grieve for your daddy, and when you feel you have to cry over what happened to him, you go into a closet or under your covers and cry until it’s all out of you again. That’s what a good son has to do. But see that you get on. That’s your job in this hard world, to keep your love alive and see that you get on, no matter what. Pull your act together and just go o"

Determining the clearest prints that Kizzy's bare feet had left in the dust, scooping up the double handful containing those footprints, he went rushing toward the cabin: The ancient forefathers said that precious dust kept in some safe place would insure Kizzy's return to where she made the footprints. He burst through the cabin's open door, his eyes sweeping the room and falling upon his gourd on a shelf containing his pebbles. Springing over there, in the instant before opening his cupped hands to drop in the dirt, suddenly he knew the truth: His Kizzy was gone; she would not return. He would never see his Kizzy again. His face contorting, Kunta flung his dust toward the cabin's roof. Tears bursting, from his eyes, snatching his heavy gourd up high over his head, his mouth wide in a soundless scream, he hurled the gourd down with all his strength, and it shattered against the packed-Earth floor, his 662 pebbles representing each month of his 55 rains flying out, ricocheting wildly in all directi"

Those men were fighters who would face the enemy till the last bullet was fired, but neither would participate in such a slaughter.Reed had had his troops in position. He was quite prepared to rush in for the kill, and he had positioned himself so that he would be in the vanguard when his men made their charge against the guns of the young braves threatening the left flank. But when he saw that the enemy had no weapons, that even their bows and arrows were not at hand, and that he was supposed to chop down little girls and old women, he rebelled on the spot, taking counsel with no one but his own consc"

I planned to examine his contribution in my master essay. In his view the primacy of the ethical over the esthetic mode was necessary to restore the balance. But enough of that. In myself I could observe the following sources of tedium: 1) The lack of a personal connection with the external world. Earlier I noted that when I was riding through France in a train last spring I looked out of the window and thought that the veil of Maya was wearing thin. And why was this? I wasn’t seeing what was there but only what everyone sees under a common directive. By this is implied that our worldview has used up nature. The rule of this view is that I, a subject, see the phenomena, the world of objects. They, however, are not necessarily in themselves objects as modern rationality defines objects. For in spirit, says Steiner, a man can step out of himself and let things speak to him about themselves, to speak about what has meaning not for him alone but also for them. Thus the sun the moon the stars will speak to nonastronomers in spite of their ignorance of science. In fact it’s high time that this happened.

He'd told Guitar that he didn't ""deserve"" his family's dependence, hatred, or whatever. That he didn't even ""deserve"" to hear all the misery and mutual accusations his parents unloaded on him. Nor did he ""deserve"" Hagar's vengeance. But why shouldn't his parents tell him their personal problems? If not him, then who? And if a stranger could try to kill him, surely Hagar, who knew him and whom he'd thrown away like a wad of chewing gum after the flavor was gone––she had a right to try to kill him too.

Their musical names remained forever fixed on the American land, but their bones were forgotten in a thousand burned villages or lost in forests fast disappearing before the axes of twenty million invaders. Already the once sweet-watered streams, most of which bore Indian names, were clouded with silt and the wastes of man; the very earth was being ravaged and squandered.

Pneumoencephalography was a technique developed in 1919 for taking images of the brain, which floats in a sea of liquid. That fluid protects the brain from damage, but makes it very difficult to X-ray, since images taken through fluid are cloudy. Pneumoencephalography involved drilling holes into the skulls of research subjects, draining the fluid surrounding their brains, and pumping air or helium into the skull in place of the fluid to allow crisp X-rays of the brain through the skull. the side effects--crippling headaches, dizziness, seizures, vomiting--lasted until the body naturally refilled the skull with spinal fluid, which usually took two to three months. Because pneumoencephalography could cause permanent brain damage and paralysis, it was abandoned in the 1970s.

When I met Nick, I knew immediately that was what he wanted, and for him, I guess I was willing to try. I will accept my portion of blame. The thing is, I was crazy about him at first. I found him perversely exotic, a good ole Missouri boy. He was so damn nice to be around. He teased things out in me that I didn’t know existed: a lightness, a humor, an ease. It was as if he hollowed me out and filled me with feathers. He helped me be Cool Girl – I couldn’t have been Cool Girl with anyone else. I wouldn’t have wanted to. I can’t say I didn’t enjoy some of it: I ate a MoonPie, I walked barefoot, I stopped worrying. I watched dumb movies and ate chemically laced foods. I didn’t think past the first step of anything, that was the key. I drank a Coke and didn’t worry about how to recycle the can or about the acid puddling in my belly, acid so powerful it could strip clean a penny. We went to a dumb movie and I didn’t worry about the offensive sexism or the lack of minorities in meaningful roles. I didn’t even worry whether the movie made sense.

Of course I cried; I was eight and I had already planned that Tomoko and her family would adopt me. My mother of course saw clean into the marrow of those dreams, and laughed.

Why can men never find things around the house? (Because they have a narrow field of vision, useful in tracking prey.) Why can women find things so easily? (Because in protecting the nest they were used to scanning a wide field.) Why can't women parallel-park? (Because low testosterone inhibits spatial ability.) Why won't men ask for directions?

And I can’t believe that, when we have all been changed and put on incorruptibility, we will forget our fantastic condition of mortality and impermanence, the great bright dream of procreating and perishing that meant the whole world to us.

His blessed descendant, Prince Arthur of England, was born in the year 1486, eldest son of Henry, the first Tudor king. This Arthur married Katharine the princess of Aragon, died at fifteen and was buried in Worcester Cathedral. If he were alive now, he would be King of England. His younger brother Henry would likely be Archbishop of Canterbury, and would not (at least, we devoutly hope not) be in pursuit of a woman of whom the cardinal hears nothing good: a woman to whom, several years before the dukes walk in to despoil him, he will need to turn his attention; whose history, before ruin seizes hi"

In the end all anyone could ever do was sum up the unknown factors in the ridiculous phrase, ""The fortunes of the battle swayed this way and that,"" or some similarly feeble and useless cliché. All of us, even when we think we have noted every tiny detail, resort to set pieces which have already been staged often enough by others. We try to reproduce the reality, but the harder we try, the more we find the pictures that make up the stock-in-trade of the spectacle of history forcing themselves upon us: the fallen drummer by, the infantry man shown in the act of stabbing another, the horse's eye starting from its socket, the invulnerable Emperor surrounded by his generals, a moment frozen still amidst the turmoil of battle.

Leaving aside the fact that A Simple Heart and A Christmas Carol were stories, not books, there was something revelatory about the taste of this bookish young pharmacist, who ... clearly and inarguably preferred minor works to major ones. He chose The Metamorphosis over The Trial, he chose Bartleby over Moby Dick, he chose A Simple Heart over Bouvard and Pecouchet, and A Christmas Carol over A Tale of Two Cities or The Pickwick Papers. What a sad paradox, thought Amalfitano. Now even bookish pharmacists are afraid to take on the great, imperfect, torrential works, books that blaze a path into the unknown. They choose the perfect exercises of the great masters.

87,1969,slaughter house five,4,"ugh America is a nation of poor. Every other nation has folk traditions of men who were poor but extremely wise and virtuous, and therefore more estimable than anyone with power and gold. No such tales are told by the American poor. They mock themselves and glorify their betters. The meanest eating or drinking establishment, owned by a man who is himself poor, is very likely to have a sign on its wall asking this cruel question: 'if you’re so smart, why ain’t you rich?' There will also be an American flag no larger than a child’s hand – glued to a lollipop stick and flying from the cash register. Americans, like human beings everywhere, believe many things that are obviously untrue. Their most destructive untruth is that it is very easy for any American to make money. They will not acknowledge how in fact hard money is to come by, and, therefore, those who have no money blame and blame and blame themselves. This inward blame has been a treasure for the rich and powerful, who have had to do less for their poor, publicly and privately, than any other ruling class since, say Napoleonic times. Many novelties have come from America. The most startling of these, a thing without precedent, is a mas"

You are strong, but there is a flaw in your strength, and unless you learn to control it the flaw will prove stronger than your strength and defeat you. The flaw? Explosive emotional reaction out of all proportion to the occasion. Why?

All right, you think they're fools, you despise them because their morals, their happiness is the source of your frustration and resentment. But these are dreadful enemies you carry within yourself--in time destructive as bullets. Mercifully, a bullet kills its victim.

Those secret tastes, defeated in the past by oranges and rhubarb, broke out into an irrepressible urge when she began to weep. She went back to eating earth. The first time she did it almost out of curiosity, sure that the bad taste would be the best cure for the temptation. And, in fact, she could not bear the earth in her mouth. But she persevered, overcome by the growing anxiety, and little by little she was getting back her ancestral appetite, the taste of primary minerals, the unbridled satisfaction of what was the original food. She would put handfuls of earth in her pockets, and ate them in small bits without being seen, with a confused feeling of pleasure and rage, as she instructed her girl friends in the most difficult needlepoint and spoke about other men, who did not deserve the sacrifice of having one eat the whitewash on the walls because of them.

The lady claimed to understand God and His Ways of Working perfectly. She could not understand why anyone should be puzzled about what had been or about what was going to be. And yet, when I showed her a blueprint of the doghouse I proposed to build, she said to me, ""I'm sorry, but I never could read one of those things."" Give it to your husband or your minister to pass on to God,"" I said, ""and, when God finds a minute, I'm sure he'll explain this doghouse of mine in a way that even YOU can understand"
98,1967,the master and margarita,4,"nd at midnight there came an apparition in hell. A handsome dark-eyed man with a dagger-like beard, in a tailcoat, stepped onto the veranda and cast a regal glance over his domain. They used to say, the mystics used to say, that there was a time when the handsome man wore not a tailcoat but a wide leather belt with pistol butts sticking out from it, and his raven hair was tied with scarlet silk, and under his command a brig sailed the Caribbean under a black death flag with a skull and crossbones.But no, no! The seductive mystics are lying, there are no Caribbean Seas in the world, no desperate freebooters to sail them, no corvette chases after them, no cannon smoke drifts across the waves. There is nothing, and there was nothing!

But while all this excitement was going on outside, poor James was forced to stay locked in his bedroom, peeping through the bars of his window at the crowds below. “The disgusting little brute will only get in everyone’s way if we let him wander about,” Aunt Spiker had said early that morning. “Oh, please!” he had begged. “I haven’t met any other children for years and years and there are going to be lots of them down there for me to play with. And perhaps I could help you with the tickets.” “Cut it out!” Aunt Sponge had snapped. “Your Aunt Spiker and I are about to become millionaires, and the last thing we want is the likes of you messing things up and getting in the way.” Later, when the evening of the first day came and the people had all gone home, the aunts unlocked James’s door and ordered him to go outside and pick up all the banana skins and orange peel and bits of paper that the crowd had left behind. “Could I please have something to eat first?” he asked. “I haven’t had a thing all day.” “No!” they shouted, kicking him out the door. “We’re too busy to make food!

159,1960,to kill a mockingbird,4,"Daylight...In my mind, the night faded. It was daytime and the neighborhood was busy. Miss Stephenie Crawford crossed the street to tell the latest to Miss Rachel. Miss Maudie bent over the azaleas.
It was summertime, and two children scampered down the sidewalk toward a man approaching in the distance. The man waved, and the children raced each other to him. It was still summertime, and the children came closer. A boy trudged down the sidewalk dragging a fishingpole behind him. A man stood waiting with his hands on his hips. Summertime, and his children played in the front yeard with their friend, enacting a strange little drama of their own invention.
It was fall and his children fought ont he sidewalk in front of Mrs. Dubose's. The boy helped his sister to her feet and they made their way home. Fall, and his children trotted to and fro around the corner, the day's woe's and triymph's on their face. They stopped at an oak tree, delighted, puzzled apprehensive."
160,1985,the handmaids tale,4,"Falling in love, we said; I fell for him. We were falling women. We believed in it, this downward motion: so lovely, like flying, and yet at the same time so dire, so extreme, so unlikely. God is love, they once said, but we reversed that, and love, like heaven, was always just around the corner. The more difficult it was to love the particular man beside us, the more we believed in Love, abstract and total. We were waiting, always, for the incarnation. That word, made flesh. And sometimes it happened, for a time. That kind of love comes and goes and is hard to remember afterwards, like pain. You would look at the man one day and you would think, I loved you, and the tense would be past, and you would be filled with a sense of wonder, because it was such an amazing and precarious and dumb thing to have done; and you would know too why your friends had been evasive about it, at the time."

He was wrapped in some fair memory: and as Frodo looked at him he knew that he beheld things as they had been in this same place. For the grim years were removed from the face of Aragorn, and he seemed clothed in white, a young lord fall and fair; and he spoke words in the Elvish tongue to one whom Frodo could not see. Arwen vanimelda, namarie! He said, and then he drew a breath, and returning out of his thought he looked at Frodo and smiled. `Here is the heart of Elvendom on earth,’ he said, `and here my heart dwells ever, unless there be a light beyond the dark roads that we still must tread, you and I. Come with me!’ And taking Frodo’s hand in his, he left the hill of Cerin Amroth and came there never again as a living man"
162,1972,watership down,4,"The full moon, well risen in a cloudless eastern sky, covered the high solitude with its light. We are not conscious of daylight as that which displaces darkness. Daylight, even when the sun is clear of clouds, seems to us simply the natural condition of the earth and air. When we think of the downs, we think of the downs in daylight, as with think of a rabbit with its fur on. Stubbs may have envisaged the skeleton inside the horse, but most of us do not: and we do not usually envisage the downs without daylight, even though the light is not a part of the down itself as the hide is part of the horse itself. We take daylight for granted. But moonlight is another matter. It is inconstant. The full moon wanes and returns again. Clouds may obscure it to an extent to which they cannot obscure daylight. Water is necessary to us, but a waterfall is not. Where it is to be found it is something extra, a beautiful ornament. We need daylight and to that extent it us utilitarian, but moonlight we do not need. When it comes, it serves no necessity. It transforms. It falls upon the banks and the grass, separating one long blade from another; turning a drift of brown, frosted leaves from a single heap to innumerable flashing fragments; or glimmering lengthways along wet twigs as though light itself were ductile.

163,1963,the belljar,4,"I saw my life branching out before me like the green fig tree in the story. From the tip of every branch, like a fat purple fig, a wonderful future beckoned and winked. One fig was a husband and a happy home and children, and another fig was a famous poet and another fig was a brilliant professor, and another fig was Ee Gee, the amazing editor, and another fig was Europe and Africa and South America, and another fig was Constantin and Socrates and Attila and a pack of other lovers with queer names and offbeat professions, and another fig was an Olympic lady crew champion, and beyond and above these figs were many more figs I couldn't quite make out. I saw myself sitting in the crotch of this fig tree, starving to death, just because I couldn't make up my mind which of the figs I would choose. I wanted each and every one of them, but choosing one meant losing all the rest, and, as I sat there, unable to decide, the figs began to wrinkle and go black, and, one by one, they plopped to the ground at my feet."
164,1965,in cold blood,4,"You are a man of extreme passion, a hungry man not quite sure where his appetite lies, a deeply frustrated man striving to project his individuality against a backdrop of rigid conformity. You exist in a half-world suspended between two superstructures, one self-expression and the other self-destruction. You are strong, but there is a flaw in your strength, and unless you learn to control it the flaw will prove stronger than your strength and defeat you. The flaw? Explosive emotional reaction out of all proportion to the occasion. Why? Why this unreasonable anger at the sight of others who are happy or content, this growing contempt for people and the desire to hurt them? All right, you think they're fools, you despise them because their morals, their happiness is the source of your frustration and resentment. But these are dreadful enemies you carry within yourself--in time destructive as bullets. Mercifully, a bullet kills its victim. This other bacteria, permitted to age, does not kill a man but leaves in its wake the hulk of a creature torn and twisted; there is still fire within his being but it is kept alive by casting upon it faggots of scorn and hate. He may successfully accumulate, but he does not accumulate success, for he is his own enemy and is kept from truly enjoying his achievements."
165,1982,the colour purple,4,"Here's the thing, say Shug. The thing I believe. God is inside you and inside everybody else. You come into the world with God. But only them that search for it inside find it. And sometimes it just manifest itself even if you not looking, or don't know what you looking for. Trouble do it for most folks, I think. Sorrow, lord. Feeling like shit. It? I ask. Yeah, It. God ain't a he or a she, but a It. But what do it look like? I ask. Don't look like nothing, she say. It ain't a picture show. It ain't something you can look at apart from anything else, including yourself. I believe God is everything, say Shug. Everything that is or ever was or ever will be. And when you cam feel that, and be happy to feel that, you've found it."
166,1995,high fidelity,4,"It would be nice to think that as I've got older times have changed, relationships have become more sophisticated, females less cruel, skins thicker, reactions sharper, instincts more developed. But there still seems to be an element of that evening in everything that happened to me since; all my other romantic stories seem to be a scrambled version of that first one. Of course, I have never had to take that long walk again, and my ears have not burned with quite the same fury, and I have never had to count the packs of cheap cigarettes in order to avoid mocking eyes and floods of tears... not really, not actually, not as such. It just feels that way, sometimes."
167,2001,the last samurai,4,"There are people who think contraception is immoral because the object of copulation is procreation. In a similar way there are people who think the only reason to read a book is to write a book; people should call up books from the dust and the dark and write thousands of words to be sent down to the dust and the dark which can be called up so that other people can send further thousands of words to join them in the dust and the dark. Sometimes a book can be called from the dust and the dark to produce a book which can be bought in shops, and perhaps it is interesting, but the people who buy it and read it because it is interesting are not serious people, if they were serious they would not care about the interest they would be writing thousands of words to consign to the dust and the dark. There are people who think death a fate worse than boredom."

""No, I won't let you."" ""Trust me,"" I whisper. He holds my gaze for a long moment then lets go. I loosen the top of the pouch and pour a few spoonfuls of berries into his palm. Then I fill my own. ""On the count of three?"" Peeta leans down and kisses me once, very gently. ""The count of three,"" he says. We stand, our backs pressed together, our empty hands locked tight. ""Hold them out. I want everyone to see,"" he says. I spread out my fingers, and the dark berries glisten in the sun. I give Peeta's hand one last squeeze as a signal, as a good-bye, and we begin counting. ""One."" Maybe I'm wrong. ""Two."" Maybe they don't care if we both die. ""Three!"" It's too late to change my mind. I lift my hand to my mouth taking one last look at the world.

Whether', 'he discusses the deep questions of fate and foreknowledge in ""Religio', 'Laici,"" or lashes Shaftesbury in the ""Medal,"" or pours a torrent of', 'contempt on Shadwell in ""MacFlecknoe,"" or describes the fire of London', 'in the ""Annus Mirabilis,"" or soars into lyric enthusiasm in his ""Ode on', 'the Death of Mrs Killigrew,"" and ""Alexander\'s Feast,"" or paints a', 'tournament in ""Palamon and Arcite,"" or a fairy dance in the ""Flower and', 'the Leaf,""--he is always at home, and always aware that he is. His', 'consciousness of his own powers amounts to exultation. He is like the', 'steed who glories in that tremendous gallop which affects the spectator', ""with fear. Indeed, we never can separate our conception of Dryden's"", 'vigorous and vaulting style from the image of a noble horse, devouring', 'the dust of the field, clearing obstacles at a bound, taking up long', 'leagues as a little thing, and the very strength and speed of whose', 'motion give it at a distance the appearance of smoothness.

We know no poet since Homer who can be compared', 'to Dryden in this respect, except Scott, who occasionally, in ""Marmion,""', 'and the ""Lay of the Last Minstrel,"" exhibits the same impetuous ease and', 'fiery fluent movement.

Scott exhibits in his poetry the soul of a warrior; but it is of', 'a warrior of the Border--somewhat savage and coarse. Dryden can, for the', 'nonce at least, assume the appearance, and display the spirit, of a', 'knight of ancient chivalry--gallant, accomplished, elegant, and gay.', '', ""Next to this poet's astonishing ease, spirit, and elastic vigour, may be"", 'ranked his clear, sharp intellect.

Parts of his', '""Religio Laici"" and the ""Hind and Panther"" resemble portions of Duns', 'Scotus or Aquinas set on fire. Indeed, keen, strong intellect, inflamed', 'with passion, and inspirited by that ""ardour and impetuosity of mind""', 'which Wordsworth is compelled to allow to him, rather than creative or', 'original genius, is the differentia of Dryden.

His path was on the plains or table-lands of earth--never or', 'seldom in ""cloudland, gorgeous land,"" or through the aerial altitudes', 'which stretch away and above the clouds to the gates of heaven. He can', 'hardly be said to have possessed the power of sublimity, in the high', 'sense of that term, as the power of sympathising with the feeling of the', 'Infinite. Often he gives us the impression of the picturesque, of the', 'beautiful, of the heroic, of the nobly disdainful--but never (when', 'writing, at least, entirely from his own mind) of that infinite and', 'nameless grandeur which the imaginative soul feels shed on it from the', 'multitudinous waves of ocean--from the cataract leaping from his rock,', 'as if to consummate an act of prayer to God--from the hum of great', 'assemblies of men--from the sight of far-extended wastes and', 'wildernesses--and from the awful silence, and the still more mysterious', 'sparkle of the midnight stars. This sense of the presence of the', '_shadow_ of immensity--immensity itself cannot be felt any more than', 'measured--this sight like that vouchsafed to Moses of the ""backparts"" of', 'the Divine--the Divine itself cannot be seen--has been the inspiration', 'of all the highest poetry of the world--of the ""Paradise Lost,"" of the', '""Divina Commedia,"" of the ""Night Thoughts,"" of Wordsworth and Coleridge,', 'of ""Festus,"" and, highest far, of the Hebrew Prophets, as they cry,', '""Whither can we go from Thy presence? whither can we flee from Thy', 'Spirit?"" Such poets have resembled a blind man, who feels, although he', 'cannot see, that a stranger of commanding air is in the room beside him;', 'so they stand awe-struck in the ""wind of the going"" of a majestic and', 'unseen Being.

115,1725,new science,0,"e begin our principles with the idea that is the first in any work whatsoever: divine Providence, who is the architect of this world of nations. For men cannot unite in a human society unless they share ahuman sense that there is a divinity who sees into the depths of their hearts, since a society of men can neither begin nor remain stable without a means whereby some rely upon the promises of others and are satisfied by their assertions in secret matters. For it frequently happens in human life that promises need to be made and accepted, and actions undertaken, with regard to things for which, though not wrong in themselves, others need some assurance, but which lack the support of any human documentation. It might be argued that such assurance could be gained through the rigour of penal laws against lie telling, but while this could obtain in the state of the cities, it would not have been possible in the state of the families from which the cities arose, where there was as yet no civil or public rule under which two family fathers, for example, would be equally subject in justice to the armed force of the law."

After', 'much wrangling, the motion was carried, and the first blunder of the mother', 'country seemed to have been smoothed over.', '', 'Only a few months elapsed, however, when the question of taxing the colonies was', 'revived. Pitt lay ill, and could take no part in the proposed measure. Through', 'the influence of other members of his party,--notably Townshend,--a series of', 'acts were passed, imposing duties on several exports to America. This was', 'followed by a suspension of the New York Assembly, because it had disregarded', 'instructions in the matter of supplies for the troops. The colonists were', 'furious. Matters went from bad to worse. To withdraw as far as possible without', 'yielding the principle at stake, the duties on all the exports mentioned in the', 'bill were removed, except that on tea.

He was born in Dublin, Ireland,"", 'in 1729. His father was a successful lawyer and a Protestant, his mother, a', 'Catholic. At the age of twelve, he became a pupil of Abraham Shackleton, a', 'Quaker, who had been teaching some fifteen years at Ballitore, a small town', 'thirty miles from Dublin. In after years Burke was always pleased to speak of', 'his old friend in the kindest way: ""If I am anything,"" he declares, ""it is the', 'education I had there that has made me so."" And again at Shackleton\'s death,', 'when Burke was near the zenith of his fame and popularity, he writes: ""I had a', 'true honor and affection for that excellent man. I feel something like a', 'satisfaction in the midst of my concern, that I was fortunate enough to have him', 'under my roof before his departure."" It can hardly be doubted that the old', 'Quaker schoolmaster succeeded with his pupil who was already so favorably', 'inclined, and it is more than probable that the daily example of one who lived', 'out his precepts was strong in its influence upon a young and generous mind.', '', 'Burke attended school at Ballitore two years; then, at the age of fourteen, he', 'became a student at Trinity College, Dublin, and remained there five years. At', 'college he was unsystematic and careless of routine. He seems to have done', 'pretty much as he pleased, and, however methodical he became in after life, his', 'study during these five years was rambling and spasmodic. The only definite', 'knowledge we have of this period is given by Burke himself in letters to his', 'former friend Richard Shackleton, son of his old schoolmaster. What he did was', 'done with a zest that at times became a feverish impatience: ""First I was', 'greatly taken with natural philosophy, which, while I should have given my mind', 'to logic, employed me incessantly. This I call my FUROR MATHEMATICUS."" Following', 'in succession come his FUROR LOGICUS, FUROR HISTORICUS, and FUROR PEOTICUS, each', 'of which absorbed him for the time being. It would be wrong, however, to think', 'of Burke as a trifler even in his youth. He read in the library three hours', 'every day and we may be sure he read as intelligently as eagerly. It is more', 'than probable that like a few other great minds he did not need a rigid system', 'to guide him. If he chose his subjects of study at pleasure, there is every', 'reason to believe he mastered them.', '', 'Of intimate friends at the University we hear nothing. Goldsmith came one year', 'later, but there is no evidence that they knew each other. It is probable that', 'Burke, always reserved, had little in common with his young associates. His own', 'musings, with occasional attempts at writing poetry, long walks through the', 'country, and frequent letters to and from Richard Shackleton, employed him when', 'not at his books.', '', 'Two years after taking his degree, Burke went to London and established himself', 'at the Middle Temple for the u']"

Writs of Assistance (1761) were followed by the passage', 'of the Stamp Act (1765). The ostensible object of both these measures was to', 'help pay the debt incurred by the French war, but the real purpose lay deeper,', 'and was nothing more or less than the ultimate extension of parliamentary rule,', 'in great things as well as small, to America. At this crisis, so momentous for', 'the colonists, the Rockingham ministry was formed, and Burke, together with', 'Pitt, supported a motion for the unconditional repeal of the Stamp Act. After', 'much wrangling, the motion was carried, and the first blunder of the mother', 'country seemed to have been smoothed over.', '', 'Only a few months elapsed, however, when the question of taxing the colonies was', 'revived. Pitt lay ill, and could take no part in the proposed measure. Through', 'the influence of other members of his party,--notably Townshend,--a series of', 'acts were passed, imposing duties on several exports to America. This was', 'followed by a suspension of the New York Assembly, because it had disregarded', 'instructions in the matter of supplies for the troops. The colonists were', 'furious. Matters went from bad to worse. To withdraw as far as possible without', 'yielding the principle at stake, the duties on all the exports mentioned in the', 'bill were removed, except that on tea. But it was precisely the principle for', 'which the colonists were contending. They were not in the humor for compromise,', 'when they believed their freedom was endangered, and the strength and', 'determination of their resistance found a climax in the Boston Tea Party.', '', 'In the meantime, Lord North, who was absolutely obedient to the king, had become', 'prime minister. Five bills were prepared, the tenor of which, it was thought,', 'would overawe the colonists. Of these, the Boston Port Bill and the Regulating', 'Act are perhaps the most famous, though the ultimate tendency of all was blindly', 'coercive.', '', 'While the king and his friends were busy with these, the opposition proposed an', 'unconditional repeal of the Tea Act. The bill was introduced only to be', 'overwhelmingly defeated by the same Parliament that passed the five measures of', 'Lord North.', '', 'In America, the effect of these proceedings was such as might have been expected', 'by thinking men. The colonies were as a unit in their support of Massachusetts.', ""The Regulating Act was set at defiance, public officers in the king's service"", 'were forced to resign, town meetings were held, and preparations for war were', ""begun in dead earnest. To avert this, some of England's greatest statesmen--Pitt"", 'among the number--asked for a reconsideration. On February the first, 1775, a', 'bill was introduced, which would have gone far toward bringing peace.

Numberless recent massacres were still vivid in their', 'recollections; nor was there any ear in the provinces so deaf as not to', 'have drunk in with avidity the narrative of some fearful tale of', 'midnight murder, in which the natives of the forests were the principal', 'and barbarous actors. As the credulous and excited traveller related the', 'hazardous chances of the wilderness, the blood of the timid curdled', 'with terror, and mothers cast anxious glances even at those children', 'which slumbered within the security of the largest towns. In short, the', 'magnifying influence of fear began to set at naught the calculations of', 'reason, and to render those who should have remembered their manhood,', 'the slaves of the basest of passions. Even the most confident and the', 'stoutest hearts began to think the issue of the contest was becoming', 'doubtful; and that abject class was hourly increasing in numbers, who', 'thought they foresaw all the possessions of the English crown in America', 'subdued by their Christian foes, or laid waste by the inroads of their', 'relentless allies.', '', 'When, therefore, intelligence was received at the fort, which covered', 'the southern termination of the portage between the Hudson and the', 'lakes, that Montcalm had been seen moving up the Champlain, with an army', '""numerous as the leaves on the trees,"" its truth was admitted with more', 'of the craven reluctance of fear than with the stern joy that a warrior', 'should feel, in finding an enemy within reach of his blow. The news had', 'been brought, towards the decline of a day in midsummer, by an Indian', 'runner, who also bore an urgent request from Munro, the commander of a', 'work on the shore of the ""holy lake,"" for a speedy and powerful', 'reinforcement. It has already been mentioned that the distance between', 'these two posts was less than five leagues. The rude path, which', 'originally formed their line of communication, had been widened for the', 'passage of wagons; so that the distance which had been travelled by the', 'son of the forest in two hours, might easily be effected by a detachment', 'of troops, with their necessary baggage, between the rising and setting', 'of a summer sun. The loyal servants of the British crown had given to', 'one of these forest fastnesses the name of William Henry, and to the', 'other that of Fort Edward; calling each after a favorite prince of the', 'reigning family. The veteran Scotchman just named held the first, with a', 'regiment of regulars and a few provincials; a force really by far too', 'small to make head against the formidable power that Montcalm was', 'leading to the foot of his earthen mounds. At the latter, however, lay', 'General Webb, who commanded the armies of the king in the northern', 'provinces, with a body of more than five thousand men. By uniting the', 'several detachments of his command, this officer might have arrayed', 'nearly double that number of combatants against the enterprising', 'Frenchman, who had ventured so far from his reinforcements, with an army', 'but little superior in numbers.', '', 'But under the influence of their degraded fortunes, both officers and', 'men appeared better disposed to await the approach of their formidable', 'antagonists, within their works, than to resist the progress of their', 'march, by emulating the successful example of the French at Fort du', 'Quesne, and striking a blow on their advance.', '', 'After the first surprise of the intelligence had a little abated, a', 'rumor was spread through the entrenched camp, which stretched along the', 'margin of the Hudson, forming a chain of outworks to the body of the', 'fort itself, that a chosen detachment of fifteen hundred men was to', 'depart, with the dawn, for William Henry, the post at the northern', 'extremity of the portage. That which at first was only rumor, soon', 'became certainty, as orders passed from the quarters of the', 'commander-in-chief to the several corps he had selected for this', 'service, to prepare for their speedy departure.

I feel something like a', 'satisfaction in the midst of my concern, that I was fortunate enough to have him', 'under my roof before his departure."" It can hardly be doubted that the old', 'Quaker schoolmaster succeeded with his pupil who was already so favorably', 'inclined, and it is more than probable that the daily example of one who lived', 'out his precepts was strong in its influence upon a young and generous mind.', '', 'Burke attended school at Ballitore two years; then, at the age of fourteen, he', 'became a student at Trinity College, Dublin, and remained there five years. At', 'college he was unsystematic and careless of routine. He seems to have done', 'pretty much as he pleased, and, however methodical he became in after life, his', 'study during these five years was rambling and spasmodic. The only definite', 'knowledge we have of this period is given by Burke himself in letters to his', 'former friend Richard Shackleton, son of his old schoolmaster. What he did was', 'done with a zest that at times became a feverish impatience: ""First I was', 'greatly taken with natural philosophy, which, while I should have given my mind', 'to logic, employed me incessantly. This I call my FUROR MATHEMATICUS."" Following', 'in succession come his FUROR LOGICUS, FUROR HISTORICUS, and FUROR PEOTICUS, each', 'of which absorbed him for the time being. It would be wrong, however, to think', 'of Burke as a trifler even in his youth. He read in the library three hours', 'every day and we may be sure he read as intelligently as eagerly. It is more', 'than probable that like a few other great minds he did not need a rigid system', 'to guide him. If he chose his subjects of study at pleasure, there is every', 'reason to believe he mastered them.', '', 'Of intimate friends at the University we hear nothing.

As I walked along, thoughtful, and regardless of the surrounding objects, I felt something clasp my knees, and immediately perceived it was a child of about five or six years old, clinging round them, who at the same time looked up so fondly and familiarly in my face, that I was greatly moved, saying to myself, ""thus I should have been treated by my own."" I took the child in my arms, and after having kissed it several times, in a kind of transport, continued my way.

In short,', 'though for the most part monumentally selfish, she is yet saved from', 'being impossible by several displays of noble emotion.

At least he has succeeded in making two or three of his women"", 'characters more alive than any of his men. It is another surprise that', 'in writing of women, Defoe often seems ahead of his age.

This, perhaps, is not to Defoe's credit, but it is to his credit"", 'that he has said elsewhere:[2] ""A woman well-bred and well-taught,', 'furnished with the ... accomplishments of knowledge and behaviour, is a', 'creature without comparison; her society is the emblem of sublime', 'enjoyments; ... and the man that has such a one to his portion, has', 'nothing to do but to rejoice in her, and be thankful."" After reading', 'these words, one cannot but regret that Defoe did not try to create', 'heroines more virtuous than Moll Flanders and Roxana.', '', 'It is not only in drawing his characters that Defoe, in _The Fortunate', 'Mistress_, comes nearer than usual to producing a novel.

In both of them--the story of a solitary on a desert', 'island and the story of the visitation of a pestilence--the nature of', ""the subject made the author's course tolerably plain; in _The Fortunate"", 'Mistress_, the proper course was by no means so well marked. The more', 'credit is due Defoe, therefore, that the book is so far from being', 'entirely inorganised that, had he taken sufficient pains with the', 'ending, it would have had as much structure as many good novels. There', 'is no strongly defined plot, it is true; but in general, if a character', 'is introduced, he is heard from again; a scene that impresses itself on', 'the mind of the heroine is likely to be important in the sequel.

Towards all the men with whom she has', 'dealings, and towards the friendly Quakeress of the Minories, too, she', 'shows a calculating reticence which is most unfeminine.

After reading', 'these words, one cannot but regret that Defoe did not try to create', 'heroines more virtuous than Moll Flanders and Roxana.', '', 'It is not only in drawing his characters that Defoe, in _The Fortunate', 'Mistress_, comes nearer than usual to producing a novel.

In both of them--the story of a solitary on a desert', 'island and the story of the visitation of a pestilence--the nature of', ""the subject made the author's course tolerably plain; in _The Fortunate"", 'Mistress_, the proper course was by no means so well marked.

So they said to one another: ""'Let's join together and make a great book that will last forever to mock the credulity of man. Let's persuade our more erotic poets to write about the delights of the flesh, and induce some of our robust journalists to contribute stories of famous amours. We'll include all the most preposterous old wives' tales now current. We'll choose the keenest satirist alive to compile a deity from all the deities worshipped by mankind, a deity who will be more magnificent than any of them, and yet so weakly human that he'll become a byword for laughter the world over--and we'll ascribe to him all sorts of jokes and vanities and rages, in which he'll be supposed to indulge for his own diversion, so that the people will read our book and ponder it, and there'll be no more nonsense in the world"

He was made of quite a different', 'paste. The girls and the father were strong-limbed, thick-blooded people,', 'true English, as holly-trees and hawthorn are English.

Dark, like a lair where strong beasts had lurked and', 'mated, lonely at night and lonely by day, left to themselves and their', 'own intensity for so many generations.

The spear of modern invention had not passed through', 'it, and it lay there secret, primitive, savage as when the Saxons first', 'came.

There were plenty of things to be done, the', 'house to be put into final repair after the workmen had gone, cushions', 'and curtains to sew, the paths to make, the water to fetch and attend to,', 'and then the slope of the deep-soiled, neglected garden to level, to', 'terrace with little terraces and paths, and to fill with flowers. He', 'worked away, in his shirt-sleeves, worked all day intermittently doing', 'this thing and the other. And she, quiet and rich in herself, seeing him', 'stooping and labouring away by himself, would come to help him, to be', 'near him. He of course was an amateur--a born amateur. He worked so hard,', 'and did so little, and nothing he ever did would hold together for long.', 'If he terraced the garden, he held up the earth with a couple of long', 'narrow planks that soon began to bend with the pressure from behind, and', 'would not need many years to rot through and break and let the soil', 'slither all down again in a heap towards the stream-bed. But there you', 'are. He had not been brought up to come to grips with anything, and he', 'thought it would do.

The', 'young man who should ""chuck"" admired politics, and of course some other', ""admired object with them, would be all very well; but he wouldn't be"", 'enough--therefore what should one say to some other young man who would', 'chuck something and somebody else, admired in their way too?', '', 'There need never, at the worst, be any difficulty about the things', 'advantageously chuckable for art; the question is all but of choosing', 'them in the heap.

This, however, would by good luck be', 'perfectly possible too--without a sacrifice of truth; and I should', 'doubtless even be able to make my theatric case as important as I might', 'desire it. It seemed clear that I needed big cases--small ones would', 'practically give my central idea away; and I make out now my still', 'labouring under the illusion that the case of the sacrifice for art', '_can_ ever be, with truth, with taste, with discretion involved,', 'apparently and showily ""big."" I daresay it glimmered upon me even then', 'that the very sharpest difficulty of the victim of the conflict I should', 'seek to represent, and the very highest interest of his predicament,', 'dwell deep in the fact that his repudiation of the great obvious, great', 'moral or functional or useful character, shall just have to consent to', 'resemble a surrender for absolutely nothing. Those characters are all', 'large and expansive, seated and established and endowed; whereas the', 'most charming truth about the preference for art is that to parade', 'abroad so thoroughly inward and so naturally embarrassed a matter is to', 'falsify and vulgarise it; that as a preference attended with the honours', 'of publicity it is indeed nowhere; that in fact, under the rule of its', 'sincerity, its only honours are those of contradiction, concentration', 'and a seemingly deplorable indifference to everything but itself.', 'Nothing can well figure as less ""big,"" in an honest thesis, than a', ""marked instance of somebody's willingness to pass mainly for an ass.

Then it is that the', 'attitude of hero or heroine may look too much--for the romantic', 'effect--like a low crouching over proved trifles. Art indeed has in our', 'day taken on so many honours and emoluments that the recognition of its', 'importance is more than a custom, has become on occasion almost a fury:', 'the line is drawn--especially in the English world--only at the', 'importance of heeding what it may mean.', '', 'The more I turn my pieces over, at any rate, the more I now see I must', 'have found in them, and I remember how, once well in presence of my', 'three typical examples, my fear of too ample a canvas quite dropped. The', 'only question was that if I had marked my political case, from so far', 'back, for ""a story by itself,"" and then marked my theatrical case for', 'another, the joining together of these interests, originally seen as', 'separate, might, all disgracefully, betray the seam, show for mechanical', 'and superficial. A story was a story, a picture a picture, and I had a', 'mortal horror of two stories, two pictures, in one. The reason of this', 'was the clearest--my subject was immediately, under that disadvantage,', 'so cheated of its indispensable centre as to become of no more use for', 'expressing a main intention than a wheel without a hub is of use for', 'moving a cart. It was a fact, apparently, that one _had_ on occasion', 'seen two pictures in one; were there not for instance certain sublime', 'Tintorettos at Venice, a measureless Crucifixion in especial, which', 'showed without loss of authority half-a-dozen actions separately taking', 'place? Yes, that might be, but there had surely been nevertheless a', 'mighty pictorial fusion, so that the virtue of composition had somehow', 'thereby come all mysteriously to its own. Of course the affair would be', 'simple enough if composition could be kept out of the question; yet by', 'what art or process, what bars and bolts, what unmuzzled dogs and', 'pointed guns, perform that feat? I had to know myself utterly inapt for', 'any such valour and recognise that, to make it possible, sundry things', 'should have begun for me much further back than I had felt them even in', 'their dawn. A picture without composition slights its most precious', 'chance for beauty, and is, moreover, not composed at all unless the', 'painter knows _how_ that principle of health and safety, working as an', 'absolutely premeditated art, has prevailed.

Both Moslem and', 'Christian would have thought such speculations not only impious but', 'utterly unpractical.

The Eugenists' books and"", 'articles are full of suggestions that non-eugenic unions should and', 'may come to be regarded as we regard sins; that we should really feel', 'that marrying an invalid is a kind of cruelty to children. But history', 'is full of the praises of people who have held sacred such ties to', 'invalids; of cases like those of Colonel Hutchinson and Sir William', 'Temple, who remained faithful to betrothals when beauty and health had', 'been apparently blasted. And though the illnesses of Dorothy Osborne', 'and Mrs. Hutchinson may not fall under the Eugenic speculations (I do', 'not know), it is obvious that they might have done so; and certainly', ""it would not have made any difference to men's moral opinion of the"", 'act. I do not discuss here which morality I favour; but I insist that', 'they are opposite. The Eugenist really sets up as saints the very men', 'whom hundreds of families have called sneaks. To be consistent, they', 'ought to put up statues to the men who deserted their loves because of', 'bodily misfortune; with inscriptions celebrating the good Eugenist', 'who, on his fiancÃ©e falling off a bicycle, nobly refused to marry her;', 'or to the young hero who, on hearing of an uncle with erysipelas,', 'magnanimously broke his word.

His path was on the plains or table-lands of earth--never or', 'seldom in ""cloudland, gorgeous land,"" or through the aerial altitudes', 'which stretch away and above the clouds to the gates of heaven.

Often he gives us the impression of the picturesque, of the', 'beautiful, of the heroic, of the nobly disdainful--but never (when', 'writing, at least, entirely from his own mind) of that infinite and', 'nameless grandeur which the imaginative soul feels shed on it from the', 'multitudinous waves of ocean--from the cataract leaping from his rock,', 'as if to consummate an act of prayer to God--from the hum of great', 'assemblies of men--from the sight of far-extended wastes and', 'wildernesses--and from the awful silence, and the still more mysterious', 'sparkle of the midnight stars. This sense of the presence of the', '_shadow_ of immensity--immensity itself cannot be felt any more than', 'measured--this sight like that vouchsafed to Moses of the ""backparts"" of', 'the Divine--the Divine itself cannot be seen--has been the inspiration', 'of all the highest poetry of the world--of the ""Paradise Lost,"" of the', '""Divina Commedia,"" of the ""Night Thoughts,"" of Wordsworth and Coleridge,', 'of ""Festus,"" and, highest far, of the Hebrew Prophets, as they cry,', '""Whither can we go from Thy presence? whither can we flee from Thy', 'Spirit?""

He, at all events, did little in his own proper poetic', 'calling for two years.

He', 'planned, indeed, too, and partly wrote, one or more plays, and was', 'considered of consequence enough to be elected a member of the Royal', 'Society in 1662. Previous to this he had been introduced, through', 'Herringman, to Sir Robert Howard, son of the first Earl of Berkshire,', 'and a relation of Edward Howard, the author of ""British Princes,"" and', 'the object of the witty wrath of Butler.

After He had reviewed it a little while, the Interpreter called for a man to come and sweep.

Then said the Interpreter to a damsel who stood nearby, ""Bring water, and sprinkle the room."" When she had done as requested, it was swept and cleansed very pleasantly. Then Christian asked, ""What does this mean?"" The Interpreter answered, ""This parlor is the heart of a man that has never been sanctified by the sweet grace of the gospel; the dust is his original sin and inward corruptions that have defiled the whole man. The first man that began to sweep is the Law; the damsel that brought water and sprinkled it is the gospel.

Two years after Dryden came to London,', 'Cromwell expired, and the poet wrote and published his Heroic Stanzas on', ""the hero's death, which we consider really his earliest poem. When"", 'Richard resigned, Dryden, in common with the majority of the nation, saw', 'that the Roundhead cause was lost, and hastened to carry over his', 'talents to the gaining side. For this we do not blame him very severely,', 'although it certainly had been nobler if, like Milton, he had clung to', 'his party.

In ""Absalom and Achitophel"" he sneers at', 'Richard as Ishbosheth, but says nothing against the deceased giant Saul.', 'It is clear, too, that at first his desertion of the Cromwell party was', 'a loss to the poet. He lost the chance of their favour, in case a', 'reaction should come, his situation as secretary, and the shelter of', ""Pickering's princely mansion. As might have been expected, his ancient"", 'friends were indignant at the change, and not less so at the alteration', 'he thought proper at the same time to make in the spelling of his', 'name--from Driden to Dryden.', '', 'He went to reside in the obscure house of one Herringman, a bookseller,', 'in the New Exchange, and became for life a professional author. His', 'enemies afterwards reproached him bitterly for his mean circumstances at', 'this period of his life, and asserted that he was a mere drudge to', 'Herringman. He, at all events, did little in his own proper poetic', 'calling for two years. A poem on the Coronation of Charles, well fitted', 'to wipe away the stain of Cromwellism, and to attract upon the poet the', 'eye of that Rising-Sun, whose glory he sang with more zeal than truth; a', 'panegyric on the Lord Chancellor; and a satire on the Dutch; were all,', 'and are all short, and all savour of a vein somewhat hide-bound. He', 'planned, indeed, too, and partly wrote, one or more plays, and was', 'considered of consequence enough to be elected a member of the Royal', 'Society in 1662. Previous to this he had been introduced, through', 'Herringman, to Sir Robert Howard, son of the first Earl of Berkshire,', 'and a relation of Edward Howard, the author of ""British Princes,"" and', 'the object of the witty wrath of Butler. Sir Robert, too, had a', 'poetical propensity, and Dryden and he became and continued intimate for', 'a number of years, the poet assisting the knight in his literary', 'compositions, particularly in a play entitled ""The Indian Queen;"" and', 'the latter inviting the former to the family seat at Charlton, where', 'Dryden met in an unlucky hour his future wife, Lady Elizabeth Howard,', 'the sister of Sir Robert. It was on the 1st of December 1663, in St', ""Swithin's, London, and with the consent of the Earl, who settled about"", 'Â£60 a-year on his daughter, that this unhappy union took place. The lady', 'seems to have had absolutely none of the qualities which tend either to', ""command a husband's respect or to conciliate his regard, but is"", 'described as a woman of violent temper and weak understanding. Much of', ""the bitterness of Dryden's satire, some of the coarse licentiousness of"", 'his plays, and all the sarcasms at matrimony which he has scattered in', 'multitudes, throughout his works, may be traced to his domestic', 'unhappiness.', '', 'Otherwise, the match had some advantages. It broke up, for a time at', 'least, some licentious connexions he had formed, particularly, after a', 'time, one with Mrs Reeves the actress, with whom, having laid aside his', 'Norwich drugget, he used to eat tarts at the Mulberry Gardens, ""with a', 'sword and a Chadreux wig."" It secured to him, including his own', 'property, an income of about Â£100 a-year--a sum equal to Â£300 now--and', 'which, on the death of his mother, three years later, was increased by', 'Â£20 more, or Â£60 at the present value of money. He was thus protected', 'for life against the meaner and more miserable necessities of the', 'literary man, under which many of his unfortunate rivals were crushed;', 'and if he could not always command luxuries, he was always sure of', 'bread.', '', 'To improve his circumstances, however, and to enable him to keep up a', ""style of living in unison with his lady's rank, he must write, and the"", 'question arose, what mode of composition was likely to be the most', 'lucrative? Were he to continue to indite panegyrical verses, like those', 'to Clarendon, he stood a chance of having a few guineas tossed to him', 'now and then by a patron, like a crust to an unfortunate cur. Were he', 'to translate, or write prefaces for the booksellers, he might pay his', 'bill for salt, if diligent enough. For Satires as yet there was little', 'demand.

Whether', 'he discusses the deep questions of fate and foreknowledge in ""Religio', 'Laici,"" or lashes Shaftesbury in the ""Medal,"" or pours a torrent of', 'contempt on Shadwell in ""MacFlecknoe,"" or describes the fire of London', 'in the ""Annus Mirabilis,"" or soars into lyric enthusiasm in his ""Ode on', 'the Death of Mrs Killigrew,"" and ""Alexander\'s Feast,"" or paints a', 'tournament in ""Palamon and Arcite,"" or a fairy dance in the ""Flower and', 'the Leaf,""--he is always at home, and always aware that he is. His', 'consciousness of his own powers amounts to exultation. He is like the', 'steed who glories in that tremendous gallop which affects the spectator', ""with fear. Indeed, we never can separate our conception of Dryden's"", 'vigorous and vaulting style from the image of a noble horse, devouring', 'the dust of the field, clearing obstacles at a bound, taking up long', 'leagues as a little thing, and the very strength and speed of whose', 'motion give it at a distance the appearance of smoothness. Pope speaks', 'of his', '', '""Long resounding march, and energy divine.""', '', 'Perhaps ""_ease_ divine"" had been words more characteristic of that', 'almost superhuman power of language by which he makes the most obstinate', 'materials pliant, melts down difficulties as if by the touch of magic,', 'and, to resume the former figure, comes into the goal without a hair', 'turned on his mane, or a single sweat-drop confessing effort or', 'extraordinary exertion. We know no poet since Homer who can be compared', 'to Dryden in this respect, except Scott, who occasionally, in ""Marmion,""', 'and the ""Lay of the Last Minstrel,"" exhibits the same impetuous ease and', 'fiery fluent movement.

Scott exhibits in his poetry the soul of a warrior; but it is of', 'a warrior of the Border--somewhat savage and coarse. Dryden can, for the', 'nonce at least, assume the appearance, and display the spirit, of a', 'knight of ancient chivalry--gallant, accomplished, elegant, and gay.', '', ""Next to this poet's astonishing ease, spirit, and elastic vigour, may be"", 'ranked his clear, sharp intellect. He may be called more a logician than', 'a poet. He reasons often, and always acutely, and his rhyme, instead of', 'shackling, strengthens the movement of his argumentation. Parts of his', '""Religio Laici"" and the ""Hind and Panther"" resemble portions of Duns', 'Scotus or Aquinas set on fire. Indeed, keen, strong intellect, inflamed', 'with passion, and inspirited by that ""ardour and impetuosity of mind""', 'which Wordsworth is compelled to allow to him, rather than creative or', 'original genius, is the differentia of Dryden. We have compared him to a', 'courser, but he was not one of those coursers of Achilles, who fed on no', 'earthly food, but on the golden barley of heaven, having sprung from the', 'gods--', '', '  [Greek: Xanthon kai Balion, to ama pnoiaesi, petesthaen.', '  Tous eteke Zephuro anemo Arpua Podargae.]', '', 'Dryden resembled rather the mortal steed which was yoked with these', 'immortal twain, the brood of Zephyr and the Harpy Podarga; only we can', 'hardly say of the poet what Homer says of Pedasus--', '', '[Greek: Os kai thnaetos eon, epeth ippois athanatoisi.]', '', 'He was _not_, although a mortal, able to keep up with the immortal', 'coursers. His path was on the plains or table-lands of earth--never or', 'seldom in ""cloudland, gorgeous land,"" or through the aerial altitudes', 'which stretch away and above the clouds to the gates of heaven. He can', 'hardly be said to have possessed the power of sublimity, in the high', 'sense of that term, as the power of sympathising with the feeling of the', 'Infinite. Often he gives us the impression of the picturesque, of the', 'beautiful, of the heroic, of the nobly disdainful--but never (when', 'writing, at least, entirely from his own mind) of that infinite and', 'nameless grandeur which the imaginative soul feels shed on it from the', 'multitudinous waves of ocean--from the cataract leaping from his rock,', 'as if to consummate an act of prayer to God--from the hum of great', 'assemblies of men--from the sight of far-extended wastes and', 'wildernesses--and from the awful silence, and the still more mysterious', 'sparkle of the midnight stars.

Whether', 'he discusses the deep questions of fate and foreknowledge in ""Religio', 'Laici,"" or lashes Shaftesbury in the ""Medal,"" or pours a torrent of', 'contempt on Shadwell in ""MacFlecknoe,"" or describes the fire of London', 'in the ""Annus Mirabilis,"" or soars into lyric enthusiasm in his ""Ode on', 'the Death of Mrs Killigrew,"" and ""Alexander\'s Feast,"" or paints a', 'tournament in ""Palamon and Arcite,"" or a fairy dance in the ""Flower and', 'the Leaf,""--he is always at home, and always aware that he is. His', 'consciousness of his own powers amounts to exultation. He is like the', 'steed who glories in that tremendous gallop which affects the spectator', ""with fear. Indeed, we never can separate our conception of Dryden's"", 'vigorous and vaulting style from the image of a noble horse, devouring', 'the dust of the field, clearing obstacles at a bound, taking up long', 'leagues as a little thing, and the very strength and speed of whose', 'motion give it at a distance the appearance of smoothness.

We know no poet since Homer who can be compared', 'to Dryden in this respect, except Scott, who occasionally, in ""Marmion,""', 'and the ""Lay of the Last Minstrel,"" exhibits the same impetuous ease and', 'fiery fluent movement.

Scott exhibits in his poetry the soul of a warrior; but it is of', 'a warrior of the Border--somewhat savage and coarse. Dryden can, for the', 'nonce at least, assume the appearance, and display the spirit, of a', 'knight of ancient chivalry--gallant, accomplished, elegant, and gay.', '', ""Next to this poet's astonishing ease, spirit, and elastic vigour, may be"", 'ranked his clear, sharp intellect.

Parts of his', '""Religio Laici"" and the ""Hind and Panther"" resemble portions of Duns', 'Scotus or Aquinas set on fire. Indeed, keen, strong intellect, inflamed', 'with passion, and inspirited by that ""ardour and impetuosity of mind""', 'which Wordsworth is compelled to allow to him, rather than creative or', 'original genius, is the differentia of Dryden. We have compared him to a', 'courser, but he was not one of those coursers of Achilles, who fed on no', 'earthly food, but on the golden barley of heaven, having sprung from the', 'gods--', '', '  [Greek: Xanthon kai Balion, to ama pnoiaesi, petesthaen.', '  Tous eteke Zephuro anemo Arpua Podargae.]', '', 'Dryden resembled rather the mortal steed which was yoked with these', 'immortal twain, the brood of Zephyr and the Harpy Podarga; only we can', 'hardly say of the poet what Homer says of Pedasus--', '', '[Greek: Os kai thnaetos eon, epeth ippois athanatoisi.]', '', 'He was _not_, although a mortal, able to keep up with the immortal', 'coursers. His path was on the plains or table-lands of earth--never or', 'seldom in ""cloudland, gorgeous land,"" or through the aerial altitudes', 'which stretch away and above the clouds to the gates of heaven. He can', 'hardly be said to have possessed the power of sublimity, in the high', 'sense of that term, as the power of sympathising with the feeling of the', 'Infinite. Often he gives us the impression of the picturesque, of the', 'beautiful, of the heroic, of the nobly disdainful--but never (when', 'writing, at least, entirely from his own mind) of that infinite and', 'nameless grandeur which the imaginative soul feels shed on it from the', 'multitudinous waves of ocean--from the cataract leaping from his rock,', 'as if to consummate an act of prayer to God--from the hum of great', 'assemblies of men--from the sight of far-extended wastes and', 'wildernesses--and from the awful silence, and the still more mysterious', 'sparkle of the midnight stars. This sense of the presence of the', '_shadow_ of immensity--immensity itself cannot be felt any more than', 'measured--this sight like that vouchsafed to Moses of the ""backparts"" of', 'the Divine--the Divine itself cannot be seen--has been the inspiration', 'of all the highest poetry of the world--of the ""Paradise Lost,"" of the', '""Divina Commedia,"" of the ""Night Thoughts,"" of Wordsworth and Coleridge,', 'of ""Festus,"" and, highest far, of the Hebrew Prophets, as they cry,', '""Whither can we go from Thy presence? whither can we flee from Thy', 'Spirit?"" Such poets have resembled a blind man, who feels, although he', 'cannot see, that a stranger of commanding air is in the room beside him;', 'so they stand awe-struck in the ""wind of the going"" of a majestic and', 'unseen Being. This feeling differs from mysticism, inasmuch as it is', 'connected with a reality, while the mystic dreams a vague and', 'unsupported dream, and the poetry it produces is simply the irresistible', 'cry springing from the perception of this wondrous Some One who is', 'actually near them.
